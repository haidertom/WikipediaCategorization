'''''A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction''''' is a 1977 book on [[architecture]], [[urban design]], and community [[livability]].  It was authored by [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Sara Ishikawa]] and [[Murray Silverstein]] of the [[Center for Environmental Structure]] of [[Berkeley, California]], with writing credits also to Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel. Decades after its publication, it is still one of the best-selling books on architecture.&lt;ref&gt;review: [http://www.katarxis3.com/Review_Nature_Order.htm Towards a New Science of Architecture, and a New Architecture of Science, KATARXIS No 3, London UK, September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book creates a new language, what the authors call a [[pattern language]] derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, "All 253 patterns together form a language." Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop or public building such as a school.

== Structure ==
Written in the 1970s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], ''A Pattern Language'' was influenced by the then-emerging language to describe computer programming and design. "A pattern language has the structure of a network," the authors write on page xviii. Thus, each pattern may have a statement that is referenced to another pattern by placing that pattern's number in brackets, for example: '''(12)''' means go to the ''Community of 7,000'' pattern. In this way, it is structured as a [[hypertext]].

It includes 253 patterns such as ''Community of 7000'' (Pattern 12) given a treatment over several pages; page 71 states: "Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5,000–10,000 persons." It is written as a set of problems and documented solutions.

According to Alexander &amp; team, the work originated from an observation that {{quote|text=At the core […] is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets and communities. This idea […] comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=front bookflap}}

The book uses words to describe patterns, supported by drawings, photographs and charts. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe, and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs. The patterns are regarded by the authors not as infallible, but as hypotheses: {{quote|text=[…] each pattern represents our current best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment will work to solve the problem presented. The empirical questions center on the problem—does it occur and is it felt in the way we have described it?—and the solution—does the arrangement we propose in fact resolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our degree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no matter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still hypotheses, all 253 of them—and are therefore all tentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new experience and observation. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. xv}}

Some patterns focus on materials, noting that some ancient systems, such as concrete, when adapted by modern technology, may become one of the best future materials: {{quote|text=We believe that ultra-lightweight concrete is one of the most fundamental bulk materials of the future. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 958}} Other patterns focus on life experiences such as the Street Cafe (Pattern 88):{{quote |text=The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by […]. Encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood. Make them intimate places, with several rooms, open to a busy path, where people can sit with coffee or a drink and watch the world go by. Build the front of the cafe so that a set of tables stretch out of the cafe, right into the street. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 437,439}}

When these patterns are taken together, the authors say, they begin to form a kind of language, each pattern forming a word or thought of a true language rather than being a prescriptive way to design or solve a problem. As the authors write on p xiii, "Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it."

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of timeless patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality. The patterns include provision for future modification and repair, in keeping with the principle that the most satisfying living spaces are those which, like the lives of their occupants, tend to change and evolve over time.

The book values human rights such as freedom, and it shows how architecture can enhance or reduce an individual's sense of freedom {{quote|text=[…] we are saying that a centralized entrance, which funnels everyone in a building through it, has in its nature the trappings of control; while the pattern of many open stairs, leading off the public streets, direct to private doors, has in its nature the fact of independence, free comings and goings. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 742}}

== Reception ==
This book's method was adopted by the [[University of Oregon]], as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'', and remains the official planning instrument.&lt;ref name="UOCampusPlan"&gt;University of Oregon Campus Plan -- Principle 11: Patterns. {{citation|title=UO Campus Plan|year=2018|location=Eugene, Oregon|url=https://cpfm.uoregon.edu/campus-plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been adopted in part by some cities{{which|date=April 2014}} as a building code.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Alexander's conception of [[pattern]]s, and [[pattern language]]s, were major factors in the creation of [[Ward Cunningham]]'s [[WikiWikiWeb]], the first [[wiki]], which was intended as an archive and discussion web application for the [[Portland Pattern Repository]].&lt;ref name="artima"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploring with Wiki: A Conversation with Ward Cunningham, Part I |author=Bill Venners |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |publisher=artima developer |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205091836/http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |archivedate=February 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to many complex engineering tasks, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Software design pattern|design patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Berna L.

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

== Definition of religion==
One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

{{Science|applied}}
'''Applied science''' is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like [[technology]] or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called '''pure science''', develop basic ''[[information]]'' to 
predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from [[engineering]], [[business]], [[medicine]] to [[early childhood education]].

Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]]. [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==Applied research==
Applied research is the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, [[State (polity)|state-]], [[Commerce|business-]], or [[customer|client-]]driven purpose.  Applied research is contrasted with [[pure research]] (basic research) in discussion about research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first = Nils|url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62f0/dced123c24c7bc89b7d0d72bfcf885634a43.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|accessdate = September 13, 2018|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a [[random sample]]. Thus, transparency in the [[methodology]] is crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional [[conceptual framework]] such as [[working hypotheses]] or pillar questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

==Branches of applied science==
{{Outline|Outline of applied science#Branches of applied science}}

Engineering fields include [[thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[mechanics of materials]], [[kinematics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[materials science]], [[earth sciences]], [[engineering physics]].

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].

==In education==
In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (BASc) is equivalent to the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], and is classified as a professional degree.  The BASc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences.  In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree.

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom's educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of "vocational" science qualifications that run alongside "traditional" [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or [[A-Level]] Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/An%20invisible%20revolution_Applied%20Science%20in%20the%2014_19%20curriculum.pdf|format=pdf |title=Applied Science - an invisible revolution? |first=Jim |last=Donnelly |publisher=[[Nuffield Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005.
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 |title=Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report|first=Alison|last=Wolf |date=March 2011 |docket=DFE-00031-2011|publisher=Department for Education and Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, their merits are argued elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Jacqueline|last=Bell|first2=Jim|last2=Donnelly|title=Positioning Applied Science In Schools: Uncertainty, Opportunity and Risk in Curriculum Reform |url=http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001238/http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=3 October 2011|agency=Centre for Studies in Science &amp; Mathematics Education |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2007 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in "applied science." Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ |publisher=William &amp; Mary |title=Applied Science |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities' proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Mayor Bloomberg, Cornell President Skorton and Technion President Lavie announce historic partnership to build a new applied sciences campus on Roosevelt Island |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |location= |publisher=The City of New York |agency=Office of the Mayor |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|right|Banner of Peace sign]]

The '''banner of peace''' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact is the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== Description ==
Roerich described the sign thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the] proposed banner is the symbol of whole world, not a country, but the whole civilized world. The Banner proposed has on the white background three united amaranth spheres as a symbol of Eternity and Unity. Although we don't know when this Banner will fly over all cultural monuments but undoubtedly the seed has been sprouted. Already it attracts the attention of great intellects and is directed from one heart to another, awaking the idea of Peace and Benevolence among peoples."&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;"Banner of Peace." ''Collected articles''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, 1995. P. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are asked to collect where the signs of our Banner of Peace are. The sign of trinity is found scattered around the whole world. Now anybody can explain it by various ways. One says that it is the past, present and future united by the circle of eternity. Others explain it as a religion, knowledge and art in the circle of culture."&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The following description of the sign appears in the official text of the pact:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/325-480004?OpenDocument Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact). Washington, 15 April 1935. Art. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned in article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance with the model attached to this treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
In the text of the pact, Roerich wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Banner of Peace, as is now well-known, is the symbol of the Roerich Pact. This great humanitarian ideal provides in the field of mankind's cultural achievements the same guardianship as the Red Cross provides in alleviating the physical sufferings of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Aims and History." ''The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origin of Roerich's idea for the creation of the Banner of Peace sign was an ancient [[Russian icon]] by [[Andrei Rublev]]. Roerich wrote about this in his letter to Baron M.A. Taube: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At last I can send you a home photo of my last picture dedicated to meaning sense of the banner sign. You can show this photo to some committee members and also to anybody whom, as you believe, it may be useful. Say to all ignoramuses which try to substitute their self-interested and ill-intentioned explanations of the sense of this picture. What may be more ancient and more genuine than Byzantine conception which stretches in the depth of centuries to the origin united Christianity and so beautifully implemented in Rublev's icon "Saint life-giving Trinity" from the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra? Just this symbol – the symbol of ancient Christianity, consecrated for us by name of St. Sergius, gives me a hint to our sign. Its sense is expressed on the proposed photo with conservation of all elements and their positions according to the Rublev's icon. Let this photo will be with You at Paris in the case of any new attempts to destroy already existing. In addition, I send You a photo of St. Queen of the Banner – Madonna Oriflamma." (Letter from N.K. Roerich to Baron M. Taube, 13.02.1932.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

N.K. Roerich has adduced the following illustrations of presence of the Banner of Peace components in the pictures and icons of great spiritual devotees from various religions:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our post from various countries today brings us much news about the propagation of our Pact for protection of cultural values. We have received a copy of an ancient icon of St Nicholas the Miracle-Worker &lt;…&gt;, which is confirmed to printing by metropolitan Antony. From other regions we have received a photo of an edition of Kiev-Pecherskaya Laura press from 1860 of the service to Venerable Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracle-Worker. From Spain we have received a picture of St. Domingo from "Silos" (archaeological museum, Madrid). Also from Spain we have received a picture of St. Michael made by Bartolommeo Vermekho (1440). At all these pictures the sign of Banner of Peace can be seen. It is useful to remember this for many."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "Half century."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sign of the banner was also found at the Temple of Heaven.  "Tamga" of Tamerlane consists of the same sign. The sign of Three Treasures is well known for many countries of the East. On the chest of Tibetan women one can see a large fibula which is the sign. The same fibulas we see also in Caucasian findings and in Scandinavia. Madonna of Strasbourg has the same sign as well as the Spanish Saints. The same sign is on the icons of St. Sergius and St. Nicholas Miracle-Worker. The sign as a large breast fibula is depicted on Christ's breast on the well-known H. Memling's picture. When we go over sacramental pictures of Byzantine, Roma, the same symbol ties the sacramental pictures on over the world."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "The signs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions of using the banner of peace sign ==
The monuments and institutions, on which the banner of peace sign is proposed to establish, must be included by National governments in the special list. 

'''ARTICLE IV'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signatory Governments and those which accede to this treaty, shall send to the Pan American Union, at the time of signature or accession, or at any time thereafter, a list of the monuments and institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this treaty. The Pan American Union, when notifying the Governments of signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other Governments of any changes in said list.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''ARTICLE V'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The monuments and institutions mentioned in article I shall cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in case they are made use of for military purposes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Roerich wrote about these conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under [[Roerich Pact]], exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries participating in the treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of [[Red Cross]] (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol – cross).

== Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace ==
In 1990, Russian cosmonauts [[Aleksandr Nikolayevich Balandin|Aleksandr Balandin]] and [[Anatoly Solovyev]] performed a space flight on orbital station [[Mir]] with the banner of peace on board. [[Mir EO-6|This flight]] lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web| title= Banner of Peace hall |url= http://en.icr.su/museum/layout/banner/03.php |publisher= International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate= 3 November 2017 |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international scientific "banner of peace" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic cooperation."&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. 

On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Museum named after N.K. Roerich." ''Museum guide''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. P. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] have lifted the banner of peace over many mountain peaks. Among these are the following:

: - [[Belukha]], Roerich peak, Urusvati peak, Svetoslav Roerich peak (Altai);&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt;
: - [[Khan Tengri|Khan-Tengri]] (Middle Asia) ;
: - [[Everest]] ([[Himalayas]])

The banner of peace was first raised at the [[North Pole]] by the famous traveler [[Fyodor Konyukhov]] in 1988.  In 1999, participants of the first international complex Antarctic expedition "Towards to XXI" raised the banner of peace at the [[South Pole]]. The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs.&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt;

In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S. Chatterji said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will be kept in the library of Indian Parliament as most precious treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Martovitskaya, M. "Banner of Peace on the earth, in mountains and at the orbit". ''Culture'', No. 14, April 14–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along these lines, one can see the biosphere — the [[earth]] as it is affected by the [[human]] — as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century’s attitude toward the [[Human body|body]]. It assumes that in bioculture there's a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and [[mind]]. Plus it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd B, "Getting it all wrong - Bioculture critiques cultural critique" American Scholar  75 (4): 18-30 Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby MK, Smith EO "PMS: A bioculture-bound syndrome."

An alternative definition of the term bioculture is all the practical aspects of the use of [[living things in culture]], including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game for sport hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Paul W. |title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics |edition=25th Anniversary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TdcnC98eRwC&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-3853-3 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, '''black carbon''' ('''BC''') is a component of fine [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM ≤ 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in [[aerodynamic diameter]]). Black carbon consists of pure carbon in several linked forms.  It is formed through the incomplete combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[biofuel]], and [[biomass]], and is emitted in both [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and naturally occurring [[soot]].&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Anenberg SC, Schwartz J, Shindell D, Amann M, Faluvegi G, Klimont Z, Janssens-Maenhout G, Pozzoli L, Van Dingenen R, Vignati E, Emberson L, Muller NZ, West JJ, Williams M, Demkine V, Hicks WK, Kuylenstierna J, Raes F, Ramanathan V |title=Global air quality and health co-benefits of mitigating near-term climate change through methane and black carbon emission controls |journal=Environ Health Perspect |date=June 2012 |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=831–839 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104301|pmid=22418651| pmc=3385429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon causes human [[morbidity]] and premature mortality.&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012" /&gt;

In [[climatology]], black carbon is a [[climate forcing]] agent. Black carbon [[Global warming|warms the Earth]] by absorbing sunlight and heating the atmosphere and by reducing [[albedo]] when deposited on snow and ice (direct effects) and indirectly by interaction with clouds, with the total forcing of 1.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50171/abstract|title = Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment|last = Bond|date = 2013|journal = J.

Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 [[Nature Geoscience]] 221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black carbon'' is also used in [[soil sciences]] and geology, referring either to deposited atmospheric black carbon or to directly incorporated black carbon from vegetation fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masiello | first1 = C.A. | year = 2004 | title = New directions in black carbon organic geochemistry | url = | journal = MARINE CHEMISTRY | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 201–213 | doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2004.06.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = M.W.I. | last2 = Noack | first2 = A.G. | year = 2000 | title = Black carbon in soils and sediments: Analysis, distribution, implications and current challenges | url = | journal = GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 777–793 | doi=10.1029/1999gb001208 | bibcode=2000GBioC..14..777S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the tropics, black carbon in soils significantly contributes to fertility as it is able to absorb important plant nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser B (2007) Prehistorically modified soils of central Amazonia: a model for sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first century.

==Overview==
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
The term black carbon was coined by [[Tihomir Novakov]], referred to as "the godfather of black carbon studies" by [[James Hansen]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Allan|title=Carbonaceous Aerosols and Climate Change: How Researchers Proved Black Carbon is a Significant Force in the Atmosphere|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/newsletter/nl17/eetd-nl17-4-blackcarbon.html|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke or soot was the first pollutant to be recognized as having significant [[environmental impact]] yet one of the last to be studied by the contemporary atmospheric research community.  [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] recognized that soot was composed of carbon and that it was produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, M., Chemical History of a Candle, Harper, New York, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Soot is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”. The term elemental carbon has been used in conjunction with thermal and wet chemical determinations and the term  graphitic carbon suggests the presence  of [[graphite]]-like micro-crystalline structures in soot as evidenced by [[Raman Spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | title = Raman scattering and the characterization of  atmospheric aerosol particles | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 266 | issue = 708–710| page = 1977 | doi=10.1038/266708a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.266..708R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yasa | first1 = Z. | last2 = Amer | first2 = N.M. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = H. | last4 = Hansen | first4 = A.D.A | last5 = Novakov | first5 = T. | year = 1979 | title = Photoacoustic investigations of urban aerosol particles | url = | journal = Appl.

===Early mitigation attempts===
The disastrous effects of coal pollution on human health and mortality in the early 1950s in London led to the UK [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. This act led to dramatic  reductions of soot concentrations in the United Kingdom which were followed by similar reductions in US cities like Pittsburgh and St. Louis. These reductions were largely achieved by the decreased use of soft coal for domestic heating by switching either to “smokeless” coals or other forms of fuel, such as fuel oil and natural gas.  The steady reduction of smoke pollution in the industrial cities of Europe and United States caused a shift in research emphasis away from soot emissions and the almost complete neglect of black carbon as a significant aerosol constituent, at least in the United States.

In the 1970s, however, a series of studies substantially changed this picture and demonstrated that black carbon as well as the organic soot components continued to be a large component in urban aerosols across the United States and Europe&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novakov | first1 = T. | last2 = Chang | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Harker | first3 = A.B. | year = 1974 | title = Sulfates as pollution particulates:Catalytic formationon carbon(soot) particles | url = | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = | pages = 259–261 | doi=10.1126/science.186.4160.259|bibcode = 1974Sci...186..259N | pmid=17782021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | year = 1975 | title = Formation of pollution particulate nitrogen compounds by NO-soot and NH3-soot gas particle surface reactions | url = | journal = Atmos.

In the less-developed regions of the world where there were limited or no controls on soot emissions the air quality continued to degrade as the population increased.  It was not generally realized until many years later that from the perspective of global effects the emissions from these regions were extremely important.

===Influence on Earth's atmosphere===
Most of the developments mentioned above relate to air quality in urban atmospheres. The first indications of the role of black carbon in a larger, global context came from studies of the Arctic Haze phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell. J.M., Visual Range in the polar regions with particular reference to the Alaskan Arctic, ''J. Almos. Terr. Phys.'', suppl., 195-211, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  Black carbon was identified in the Arctic haze aerosols&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | last3 = Bodhaine | first3 = B. | year = 1981 | title = Soot in the Arctic | url = | journal = Atmos.

In general, aerosol particles can affect the radiation balance leading to a cooling or heating effect with the magnitude and sign of the temperature change largely dependent on aerosol optical properties, aerosol concentrations, and the albedo of the underlying surface.  A purely scattering aerosol will reflect energy that would normally be absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system back to space and leads to a cooling effect. As one adds an absorbing component to the aerosol, it can lead to a heating of the earth-atmosphere system if the reflectivity of the underlying surface is sufficiently high.

Early studies of the effects of aerosols on atmospheric radiative transfer on a global scale assumed a dominantly scattering aerosol with only a small absorbing component, since this appears to be a good representation of naturally occurring aerosols. However, as discussed above, urban aerosols have a large black carbon component and if these particles can be transported on a global scale then one would expect a heating effect over surfaces with a high surface albedo like snow or ice.  Furthermore, if these particles are deposited in the snow an additional heating effect would occur due to reductions in the surface albedo.

===Measuring and modeling spatial distribution===
Levels of Black carbon are most often determined based on the modification of the optical properties of a fiber filter by deposited particles. Either filter transmittance, filter reflectance or a combination of transmittance and reflectance is measured. [[Aethalometers]] are frequently used devices that optically detect the changing absorption of light transmitted through a filter ticket. The USEPA Environmental Technology Verification program evaluated both the Aethalometer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EPA|first=|date=February 2014|title=ETV Joint Verification Statement|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100MH5J.PDF?Dockey=P100MH5J.PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Sunset Laboratory thermal-optical analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/html/vt-ams.html#bcm]&lt;/ref&gt; A multiangle absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light.  Alternative methods rely on satellite based measurements of optical depth for large areas or more recently on spectral noise analysis for very local concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dekoninck | first1 = L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = An instantaneous spatiotemporal model to predict a bicyclist's Black Carbon exposure based on mobile noise measurements | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume =  79| issue = | pages =  623–631| doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.054 | bibcode = 2013AtmEn..79..623D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s surprisingly large ground level concentrations of black carbon were observed throughout the western Arctic.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; Modeling studies indicated that they could lead to heating over polar ice. One of the major uncertainties in modeling the effects of the Arctic haze on the solar radiation balance was limited knowledge of the vertical distributions of black carbon.

During 1983 and 1984 as part of the [[NOAA]] AGASP program, the first measurements of such distributions in the Arctic atmosphere were obtained with an [[aethalometer]] which had the capability of measuring black carbon on a real-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = A.D.A. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = H. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = The Aethalometer: an instrument for real-time measurement of optical absorption by aerosol particles | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 191–196 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90265-1| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..191H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These measurements showed substantial concentrations of black carbon found throughout the western Arctic troposphere including the North Pole.  The vertical profiles showed either a strongly layered structure or an almost uniform distribution up to eight kilometers with concentrations within layers as large as those found at ground level in typical mid-latitude urban areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=Rosen2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = A.D.A. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = Role of graphitic carbon particles in radiative transfer in the Arctic haze | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90253-5| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absorption [[optical depth]]s associated with these vertical profiles were large as evidenced by a vertical profile over the Norwegian arctic where absorption optical depths of 0.023 to 0.052 were calculated respectively for external and internal mixtures of black carbon with the other aerosol components.&lt;ref name=Rosen2/&gt;

Optical depths of these magnitudes lead to a substantial change in the solar radiation balance over the highly reflecting Arctic snow surface during the March–April time frame of these measurements modeled the Arctic aerosol for an absorption optical depth of 0.021 (which is close to the average of an internal and external mixtures for the AGASP flights), under cloud-free conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porch | first1 = W.M. | last2 = McCracken | first2 = M.C. | year = 1982 | title = Parametric study of the effects of arctic soot on solar radiation | url = | journal = Atmos.

===Presence in soils===
Up to 30% of the total carbon stored in soils is contributed by black carbon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Especially for tropical soils black carbon serves as a reservoir for nutrients. Experiments showed that soils without high amounts of black carbon are significantly less fertile than soils that contain black carbon. An example for this increased soil fertility are the [[Terra preta]] soils of central Amazonia, which are presumably human-made by pre-Columbian native populations. Terra Preta soils have on average three times higher soil organic matter (SOM) content, higher nutrient levels and a better nutrient retention capacity than surrounding infertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = B. | last2 = Haumaier | first2 = L. | last3 = Guggenberger | first3 = G. | last4 = Zech | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The 'Terra preta' phenomenon: a model for sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 37–41 | doi=10.1007/s001140000193|bibcode = 2001NW.....88...37G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the [[slash and burn]] agricultural practice used in tropical regions does not only enhance productivity by releasing nutrients from the burned vegetation but also by adding black carbon to the soil. Nonetheless, for a sustainable management, a [[slash-and-char]] practice would be better in order to prevent high emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and volatile black carbon. Furthermore, the positive effects of this type of agriculture are counteracted if used for large patches so that soil erosion is not prevented by the vegetation.

==Emission sources==

===By region===
Developed countries were once the primary source of black carbon emissions, but this began to change in the 1950s with the adoption of pollution control technologies in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 ("Until about the 1950s, North America and Western Europe were the major sources of soot emissions, but now developing nations in the tropics and East Asia are the major source problem.").&lt;/ref&gt;   Whereas the United States emits about 21% of the world’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it emits 6.1% of the world’s soot.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union and United States might further reduce their black carbon emissions by accelerating implementation of black carbon regulations that currently take effect in 2015 or 2020&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, 72 Fed. Reg. 20586, 20587 (April 25, 2007) (to be codified as 40 C.F.R. pt. 51), ''available at''http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2007/April/Day-25/a6347.pdf; Press Release, European Union, Environment: Commission welcomes final adoption of the air quality directive, (April 14, 2008), ''available at'' http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/570&amp;type = HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en.&lt;/ref&gt; and by supporting the adoption of pending International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization, Press Release, IMO Environment meeting Approves Revised Regulations on Ship Emissions, International Maritime Organization (4 April 2008),'' available at''http://www.imo.org/About/mainframe.asp?topic_id=1709&amp;doc_id=9123(The IMO has approved amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships which are now subject to adoption at an October 2008  meeting.).&lt;/ref&gt; Existing regulations also could be expanded to increase the use of clean diesel and [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] and to develop second-generation technologies.

Today, the majority of black carbon emissions are from developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 2-3 (October 18, 2007), ''available at''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110647.pdf [hereinafter Bond Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; and this trend is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="Reference Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sources of black carbon are Asia, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, ''Summary: Aerosols'', Air Pollution as a Climate Forcing: A Workshop, Honolulu, Hawaii, April 29-May 3, 2002, ''available at'' http://www.giss.nasa.gov/meetings/pollution2002/&lt;/ref&gt;  China and India together account for 25-35% of global black carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael,'' supra'' note 1, at 226&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon emissions from China doubled from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan" /&gt;  Existing and well-tested technologies used by developed countries, such as clean diesel and clean coal, could be transferred to developing countries to reduce their emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony,'' supra'' note 4, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon emissions are highest in and around major source regions. This results in regional hotspots of atmospheric solar heating due to black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotspot areas include:&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
* eastern China 
* most of Southeast Asia and Indonesia 
* equatorial regions of Africa 
* Mexico and Central America 
* most of Brazil and Peru in South America.

Approximately three billion people live in these hotspots.&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"/&gt;

===By source===
[[File:Tahmand alumiiniumpott.JPG|thumb|Black carbon on a cooking pot. Result of a biofuel cooking.]]
Approximately 20% of black carbon is emitted from burning biofuels, 40% from fossil fuels, and 40% from open biomass burning.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.'' at 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar estimates of the sources of black carbon emissions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See Bond Testimony, ''supra'' note 42, at 2 (figure 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

*42%    Open biomass burning (forest and savanna burning)
*18%	Residential biofuel burned with traditional technologies
*14%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for transportation
*10%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for industrial use
*10% 	Industrial processes and power generation, usually from smaller boilers
*6%	Residential [[coal]] burned with traditional technologies&lt;ref&gt;Bond Testimony,'' id.'' at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon sources vary by region.  For example, the majority of soot emissions in South Asia are due to biofuel cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venkataraman | first1 = C. | last2 = Habib | first2 = G. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Residential Biofuels in South Asia: Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions and Climate Impacts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5714| pages = 1454–1456 | doi=10.1126/science.1104359|bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1454V | pmid=15746423}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in East Asia, coal combustion for residential and industrial uses plays a larger role. In Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.&lt;ref name="Dons et al."&gt;{{cite journal

Fossil fuel and biofuel soot have significantly greater amounts of black carbon than climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter, making reductions of these sources particularly powerful mitigation strategies. For example, emissions from the diesel engines and marine vessels contain higher levels of black carbon compared to other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 5-6 (showing that shipping emissions produce more than 3 times as much black carbon as POC, while off-road vehicles produce 40% more black carbon than POC, and on-road vehicles produce 25-60% more black carbon than POC).&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulating black carbon emissions from diesel engines and marine vessels therefore presents a significant opportunity to reduce black carbon’s global warming impact.&lt;ref&gt;Although shipping only accounts for 1.7% of the global black carbon inventory, given the expected increase in shipping throughout regions especially sensitive to black carbon like the Arctic, it still represents a strong option for black carbon reductions.  Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping, 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass burning emits greater amounts of climate-cooling [[aerosol]]s and particulate matter than black carbon, resulting in short-term cooling.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', ''supra'' note 27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over the long-term, biomass burning may cause a net warming when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and deforestation are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark. Z. Jacobson, ''The Short-Term Cooling but Long-Term Global Warming Due to Biomass Burning'', 17 ''Journal of Climate'' 2909, 2923 (". . . whereas aerosol particles emitted during burning may cause a short-term cooling of global climate, longer-lived greenhouse gases may cause warming (or cancel the cooling) after several decades. As such, reducing biomass burning may cause short-term warming but long-term cooling or no change in temperature. Although the eventual cooling may not appear for many years, its magnitude may be as large as 0.6 K after 100 yr.").&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing biomass emissions would therefore reduce global warming in the long-term and provide co-benefits of reduced air pollution, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and deforestation.  It has been estimated that by switching to [[slash-and-char]] from [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, which turns biomass into ash using open fires that release black carbon&lt;ref&gt;Surabi Menon, James Hansen, Larissa Nazarenko, &amp; Yunfeng Luo,''Climate Effects of Black Carbon'', 297 SCIENCE 2250, 2250 (27 September 2002) (Black Carbon emissions are "a product of incomplete combustion from coal, diesel engines, biofuels, and outdoor biomass burning . . .").&lt;/ref&gt; and GHGs,&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, et al., ''Bio-Char Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems – A Review'', 11 MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE 403, at 403-07, 418 (Springer 2006), ''available at http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/publ/MitAdaptStratGlobChange%2011,%20403-427,%20Lehmann,%202006.pdf ; See id.'' at 407 (Researchers estimate that between 38-84% of the biomass carbon in vegetation is released during the burn, whereas converting the biomass into bio-char by means of simple kiln techniques sequesters more than 50% of this carbon in bio-char).&lt;/ref&gt; 12% of anthropogenic carbon emissions caused by land use change could be reduced annually,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 407-08&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately 0.66 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. per year, or 2% of all annual global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Raupach, Michael, et al., ''Global and Regional Drivers of Accelerating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions'', 104 [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] 24, (underlying data available at http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0700609104/DC1) (indicating that between 2000 and 2005 land use emissions annually represented on average 1.5 GtC of the total 8.7 GtC global emissions or 5.5 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. of 31.9 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq. of global emissions—17.25% of total.

==Impacts==
Black carbon is a form of ultrafine [[particulate matter]], which when released in the air causes premature human mortality and disability.  In addition, atmospheric black carbon changes the radiative energy balance of the climate system in a way that raises air and surface temperatures, causing a variety of detrimental environmental impacts on humans, on agriculture, and on plant and animal ecosystems.

===Public health impacts===
Particulate matter is the most harmful to public health of all air pollutants in Europe. Black carbon particulate matter contains very fine [[carcinogen]]s and is therefore particularly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/black-carbon-better-monitoring-needed|title=Black carbon: Better monitoring needed to assess health and climate change impacts|website=European Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are exposed to black carbon by inhalation of air in the immediate vicinity of local sources. Important indoor sources include candles and biomass burning whereas traffic and occasionally forest fires are the major outdoor sources of black carbon exposure. Concentrations of black carbon decrease sharply with increasing distance from (traffic) sources which makes it an atypical component of [[particulate matter]]. This makes it difficult to estimate exposure of populations. For particulate matter epidemiological studies have traditionally relied on single fixed site measurements or inferred residential concentrations.&lt;ref name="Dons et al. 2013 hourly"&gt;{{cite journal

The public health benefits of reduction in the amount of soot and other particulate matter has been recognized for years. However, high concentrations persist in industrializing areas in Asia and in urban areas in the West such as [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Lydersen|first=Kari|title=Black Carbon Testing Finds High Levels| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22cnccarbon.html|accessdate=April 22, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2011|quote=Major American cities generally have background levels of one to three micrograms of black carbon per cubic meter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that air pollution causes nearly two million premature deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/index.html|title=Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing black carbon, a primary component of fine particulate matter, the health risks from air pollution will decline.  In fact, public health concerns have given rise to leading to many efforts to reduce such emissions, for example, from diesel vehicles and cooking stoves.

===Climate impacts===
'''Direct effect''' Black carbon particles directly absorb sunlight and reduce the planetary albedo when suspended in the atmosphere.

'''Semi-direct effect''' Black carbon absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. They may either increase or decrease cloud cover under different conditions.&lt;ref name="Koch and Del Genio, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=D.|author2=A.D.Del Genio|title=Black carbon semi-direct effects on cloud cover: review and synthesis|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|date=2010|volume=10|pages=7685–7696|doi=10.5194/acp-10-7685-2010|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/7685/2010/acp-10-7685-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow/ice albedo effect''' When deposited on high albedo surfaces like ice and snow, black carbon particles reduce the total surface albedo available to reflect solar energy back into space. Small initial snow albedo reduction may have a large forcing because of a positive feedback: Reduced snow albedo would increase surface temperature. The increased surface temperature would decrease the snow cover and further decrease surface albedo.&lt;ref name=JGR032612&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. C. Bond|author2=S. J. Doherty |author3=D. W.

'''Indirect effect''' Black carbon may also indirectly cause changes in the absorption or reflection of solar radiation through changes in the properties and behavior of clouds. Research scheduled for publication in 2013 shows black carbon plays a role second only to carbon dioxide in climate change. Effects are complex, resulting from a variety of factors, but due to the short life of black carbon in the atmosphere, about a week as compared to carbon dioxide which last centuries, control of black carbon offers possible opportunities for slowing, or even reversing, climate change.&lt;ref name=JGR032612/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|author2=S.

====Radiative forcing====
Estimates of black carbon’s globally averaged direct radiative forcing vary from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]’s estimate of + 0.34 watts per square meter (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ± 0.25,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 132 (2007), available at http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm. (Magnitudes and uncertainties added together, as per standard uncertainty rules)&lt;/ref&gt;  to a more recent estimate by V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael of 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a"&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 NATURE GEOSCIENCE  221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC also estimated the globally averaged snow albedo effect of black carbon at +0.1 ± 0.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Based on the IPCC estimate, it would be reasonable to conclude that the combined direct and indirect snow albedo effects for black carbon rank it as the third largest contributor to globally averaged positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial period. In comparison, the more recent direct radiative forcing estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael &lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a" /&gt; would lead one to conclude that black carbon has contributed the second largest globally averaged radiative forcing after carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and that the radiative forcing of black carbon is “as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, or tropospheric ozone.”

====Effects on Arctic ice and Himalayan glaciers====
According to the {{abbr|IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}, “the presence of black carbon over highly reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice, or clouds, may cause a significant positive radiative forcing.”&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397. ("While the radiative forcing is generally negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with a very high surface reflectance such as desert regions in North Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas."); J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 14, at 425. (The brown haze over India, heavy with fossil fuel and biofuel soot, reaches to the Himalayas. If prevailing winds deposit even a fraction of this soot on glaciers, the snow black carbon content could be comparable to that in the Alps.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC also notes that emissions from [[biomass]] burning, which usually have a negative forcing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen, et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', 110 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D18104, 1 (2005), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022162835/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-22 |df= }} (Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as black carbon + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning black carbon + OC has a negative forcing).&lt;/ref&gt;  have a positive forcing over snow fields in areas such as the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Zender, black carbon is a significant contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be “the most efficient way to mitigate Arctic warming that we know of”.&lt;ref&gt;Zender Testimony, ''supra''note 3, at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The “climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 425.&lt;/ref&gt;  The “soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''id.'' at 428&lt;/ref&gt; “Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,” according to [[NASA]] scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''id.'' at 425&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this feedback process, “BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.”&lt;ref&gt;See ''supra'' note 18&lt;/ref&gt;  When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to [[Arctic Haze]], surface temperatures increase by 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;P.K.

Black carbon emissions from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia have the greatest absolute impact on Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn,''supra'' note 34, at 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; However, black carbon emissions actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic warming than emissions originating elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt; As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id.'' at 1732; J. Hansen &amp; M.

Thus, in that case, reduction of some of the pollutants [including soot] may make it possible to keep further Arctic warming very small and thus probably avoid loss of all sea ice.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
In its 2007 report, the IPCC estimated for the first time the direct [[radiative forcing]] of black carbon from fossil fuel emissions at +&amp;nbsp;0.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², and the radiative forcing of black carbon through its effect on the surface albedo of snow and ice at an additional +&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 136, 163 (2007), ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies and public testimony by many of the same scientists cited in the IPCC’s report estimate that emissions from black carbon are the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide emissions, and that reducing these emissions may be the fastest strategy for slowing climate change.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See id''. at 164, 170, 174–76, 217–34 (citing studies by Ramanathan, Jacobson, Zender, Hansen, and Bond); ''supra'' notes 3-4 (Zender Testimony and Ramanathan Testimony); ''infra'' notes 9 and 42 (Jacobson Testimony and Bond Testimony).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, many countries have significantly reduced black carbon emissions, especially from fossil fuel sources, primarily to improve public health from improved air quality, and “technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related BC” throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 4 (18 October 2007), ''available at ''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110734.pdf [hereinafter Ramanathan Testimony] (The developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more. Thus the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon); ''but compare'' Bond, T. C., E. Bhardwaj, R. Dong, R. Jogani, S. Jung, C. Roden, D. G. Streets, and N. M. 'Trautmann Historical emissions of black and organic carbon aerosol from energy-related combustion, 1850–2000'', 21 Global Biogeochemical Cycles GB2018 (2007) (Previous work suggests a rapid rise in [global] black carbon emissions between 1950 and 2000; this work supports a more gradual, smooth increase between 1950 and 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Given black carbon’s relatively short lifespan, reducing black carbon emissions would reduce warming within weeks. Because black carbon remains in the atmosphere only for a few weeks, reducing black carbon emissions may be the fastest means of slowing climate change in the near term.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/science/earth/16degrees.html "Third-World Stove Soot Is Target in Climate Fight"] article by Elizabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Control of black carbon, particularly from fossil-fuel and biofuel sources, is very likely to be the fastest method of slowing global warming in the immediate future,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mark Z.

OF THE NAT’L ACAD. OF SCI. 6 (12 February 2008) ("The greatest threats are tipping the Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet. . ."); J. Hansen, ''Climate Catastrophe'', NEW SCIENTIST (28 July 2007) (...the primary issue is whether global warming will reach a level such that ice sheets begin to disintegrate in a rapid, non-linear fashion on West Antarctica, Greenland or both.").&lt;/ref&gt;

“Emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions”.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 (". . . emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions.") Numerous scientists also calculate that black carbon may be second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its contribution to climate change, including Tami C. Bond &amp; Haolin Sun, ''Can Reducing Black Carbon Emissions Counteract Global Warming'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHN. (2005), at 5921 ("BC is the second or third largest individual warming agent, following carbon dioxide and methane."); ''and'' J. Hansen, ''A Brighter Future'', 53 CLIMATE CHANGE 435 (2002), ''available at'' http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2002/2002_Hansen_1.pdf (calculating the climate forcing of BC at 1.0±0.5 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation of black carbon’s combined climate forcing at 1.0–1.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², which “is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other [GHGs] such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists estimate the total magnitude of black carbon’s forcing between + 0.2 and 1.1&amp;nbsp;W/m² with varying ranges due to uncertainties. (See Table 1.) This compares with the IPCC’s climate forcing estimates of 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.48&amp;nbsp;W/m² for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. (See Table 2.)&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, "Technical Summary", in ''Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science basis,''. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 21 (2007) ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, black carbon forcing is two to three times as effective in raising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic than equivalent forcing values of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) ("The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. ("The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3."); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) ("The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the "efficacy" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson calculates that reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot particles would eliminate about 40% of the net observed global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Gross global warming should result in about 2&amp;nbsp;°C (4&amp;nbsp;°F) temperature rise. However, observed global warming is only about 0.8 °C because cooling particles off set much of the warming. Reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot would reduce about 40% of the observed warming and about 16% of the gross warming.  Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 3. ("The figure also shows that fossil-fuel plus biofuel soot may contribute to about 16% of gross global warming (warming due to all greenhouse gases plus soot plus the heat island effect), but its control in isolation could reduce 40% of net global warming.").&lt;/ref&gt;  (See Figure 1.) In addition to black carbon, fossil fuel and biofuel soot contain aerosols and particulate matter that cool the planet by reflecting the sun’s radiation away from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.'' at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the aerosols and particulate matter are accounted for, fossil fuel and biofuel soot are increasing temperatures by about 0.35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon alone is estimated to have a 20-year [[Global Warming Potential]] (GWP) of 4,470, and a 100-year GWP of 1,055–2,240.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.''  As an aerosol, there is not standardized formula for developing global warming potentials (GWP) for black carbon. However, attempts to derive GWP100 range from 190 – 2240 relative to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization calculates that cutting black carbon, along with tropospheric ozone and its precursor, methane, can reduce the rate of global warming by half and the rate of warming in the Arctic by two-thirds, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. By trimming “peak warming”, such cuts can keep current global temperature rise below 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C for 30 years and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C for 60 years, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts.

The reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as SLCFs could keep global temperature rise under 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2030, and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2070, assuming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also cut.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; See the graph on page 12 of the [http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/Black_Carbon.pdf UNEP-WMO report].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Control technologies==
Ramanathan notes that “developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more since 1950.  Thus, the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon.” &lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony, ''supra'' note 4, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson believes that “[g]iven proper conditions and incentives, [soot] polluting technologies can be quickly phased out.  In some small-scale applications (such as domestic cooking in developing countries), health and convenience will drive such a transition when affordable, reliable alternatives are available.  For other sources, such as vehicles or coal boilers, regulatory approaches may be required to nudge either the transition to existing technology or the development of new technology.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Hansen states that “technology is within reach that could greatly reduce soot, restoring snow albedo to near pristine values, while having multiple other benefits for climate, human health, agricultural productivity, and environmental aesthetics.  Already soot emissions from coal are decreasing in many regions with transition from small users to power plants with scrubbers.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L.

Jacobson suggests converting “[U.S.] vehicles from fossil fuel to electric, plug-in-hybrid, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where the electricity or hydrogen is produced by a renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal power.  Such a conversion would eliminate 160 Gg/yr (24%) of U.S. (or 1.5% of world) fossil-fuel soot and about 26% of U.S. (or 5.5% of world) carbon dioxide.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobson’s estimates, this proposal would reduce soot and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1.63 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–eq. per year.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson offers an estimate of total U.S. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2005 of 6270 metric tonnes, 26% of which is 1630.'' Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, “that the elimination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would also eliminate some cooling particles, reducing the net benefit by at most, half, but improving human health,” a substantial reduction for one policy in one country.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9&lt;/ref&gt;

For diesel vehicles in particular there are several effective technologies available.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA), "Emission Control Technologies for Diesel-Powered Vehicles," 9  (December 2007) ("Diesel oxidation catalysts installed on a vehicle’s exhaust system can reduce total PM typically by as much as 25 to over 50 percent by mass, under some conditions depending on the composition of the PM being emitted"), available at:http://www.meca.org/galleries/default-file/MECA%20Diesel%20White%20Paper%2012-07-07%20final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer, more efficient [[diesel particulate filter]]s (DPFs), or traps, can eliminate over 90% of black carbon emissions,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', ("DPFs can achieve up to, and in some cases, greater than a 90 percent reduction in PM. High efficiency filters are extremely effective in controlling the carbon fraction of the particulate, the portion of the particulate that some health experts believe may be the PM component of greatest concern").&lt;/ref&gt; but these devices require [[ultra-low sulfur diesel]] fuel (ULSD).  To ensure compliance with new particulate rules for new on-road and non-road vehicles in the U.S., the EPA first required a nationwide shift to ULSD, which allowed DPFs to be used in diesel vehicles in order to meet the standards.  Because of recent EPA regulations, black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles are expected to decline about 70 percent from 2001 to 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at 5, ("Mobile source black carbon emissions are estimated at 234 Gg in 2001, representing 54 percent of the nationwide black carbon emissions of 436 Gg.  Under Scenario F, mobile source emissions are projected to decline to 71 Gg, a reduction of 163 Gg."&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, “BC emissions in the United States are projected to decline by 42 percent from 2001 to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bahner, Mark A., Weitz, Keith A., Zapata, Alexandra and DeAngelo, Benjamin, Use of Black Carbon and Organic Carbon Inventories for Projections and Mitigation Analysis," 1, (2007) available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/conference/ei16/session3/k.weitz.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the full fleet is subject to these rules, EPA estimates that over 239,000 tons of particulate matter will be reduced annually.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Heavy-Duty Highway Diesel Program, available at: http://www.epa.gov/oms/highway-diesel/index.htm ("Once this action is fully implemented…Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year"); EPA, Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule—Facts and Figures, available at: http://www.epa.gov/nonroad-diesel/2004fr/420f04037.htm ("Environmental Benefits When the Fleet of Older Nonroad Engines Has Fully Turned Over by 2030: Annual reductions of Fine PM (PM2.5): 129,000 tons").&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the US diesel oxidation catalysts are often available and DPFs will become available as ULSD is more widely commercialized.

Another technology for reducing black carbon emissions from diesel engines is to shift fuels to compressed natural gas. In [[New Delhi]], India, the [[supreme court]] ordered shift to compressed natural gas for all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis, and rickshaws, resulted in a climate benefit, “largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines.”&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("When aerosol emissions are included, the switch to CNG fueling results in a climate benefit, largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines"). The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court.  ''See'' Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking'', Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the fuel switch for the vehicles reduced black carbon emissions enough to produce a 10 percent net reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq., and perhaps as much as 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("However, when aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e)").&lt;/ref&gt; The main gains were from diesel bus engines whose CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. emissions were reduced 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at Section 3.1 ("In total there is about a 10% reduction of net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions, and if buses are considered separately, net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions are reduced by about 20%").&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study examining these emissions reductions, “there is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.”&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', 1, ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies are also in development to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, ''Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping'', 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and particulate filters similar to those in use for land vehicles are now being tested on them.  As with current particulate filters these too would require the ships to use ULSD, but if comparable emissions reductions are attainable, up to 120,000 metric tons of particulate emissions could be eliminated each year from international shipping. That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts can reduce the amount of black carbon emissions from ships simply by decreasing the amount of fuel the ships use.  By traveling at slower speeds or by using shore side electricity when at port instead of running the ship’s diesel engines for electric power, ships can save fuel and reduce emissions.

Reynolds and Kandlikar estimate that the shift to [[compressed natural gas]] for public transport in New Delhi ordered by the Supreme Court reduced climate emissions by 10 to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("Between 2001 and 2003, public transport vehicles in New Delhi were required to switch their fuel to natural gas in an attempt to reduce their air pollution impacts. …[W]hen [black carbon and other] aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eq), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction…. There is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.") The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court. See Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking,'' Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanathan estimates that “providing alternative energy-efficient and smoke-free cookers and introducing transferring technology for reducing soot emissions from coal combustion in small industries could have major impacts on the radiative forcing due to soot.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the impact of replacing biofuel cooking with black carbon-free cookers (solar, bio, and natural gas) in South and East Asia is dramatic: over South Asia, a 70 to 80% reduction in black carbon heating; and in East Asia, a 20 to 40% reduction.”&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation ==

Condensed aromatic ring structures indicate black carbon degradation in soil. [[Saprophytic fungi]] are being researched for their potential role in the degradation of black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct molecular evidence for the degradation and mobility of black carbon in soils from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter from a fire-impacted forest|journal=Organic Chemistry soil|year=2006|author1=Hockaday WC|author2=Grannas AM|author3=Kim S,|author4=Hatcher PG|volume=37|issue=4|pages=501–510|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy options==
Many countries have existing national laws to regulate black carbon emissions, including laws that address particulate emissions.  Some examples include:

*banning or regulating slash-and-burn clearing of forests and savannas;
*requiring shore-based power/electrification of ships at port, regulating idling at terminals, and mandating fuel standards for ships seeking to dock at port;
*requiring regular vehicle emissions tests, retirement, or retrofitting (e.g. adding particulate traps&lt;ref&gt;O. Boucher and M.S. Reddy, ''Climate trade-off between black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions'', 36 [[Energy Policy (journal)|ENERGY POLICY]] 193, 196-198 (2007) (Particulate traps on diesel engines reduce black carbon emissions and associated climate forcing but are partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Where the fuel penalty is 2-3%, black carbon reductions will produce positive benefits for the climate for the first 28-68 years, assuming reduction in black carbon emission is 0.150.30 g/mile, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are 15002000 g/mile, and a 100-year GWP of 680 is used for black carbon. The net positive benefits for climate will continue for up to centuries in northern regions because of black carbon's effect on snow and ice albedo).&lt;/ref&gt;), including penalties for failing to meet air quality emissions standards, and heightened penalties for on-the-road "super-emitting" vehicles;
*banning or regulating the sale of certain fuels and/or requiring the use of cleaner fuels for certain uses;
*limiting the use of chimneys and other forms of biomass burning in urban and non-urban areas;
*requiring permits to operate industrial, power generating, and oil refining facilities and periodic permit renewal and/or modification of equipment; and
*requiring filtering technology and high-temperature combustion (e.g. [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] coal) for existing power generation plants, and regulating annual emissions from power generation plants.

The International Network for Environmental Compliance &amp; Enforcement issued a Climate Compliance Alert on Black Carbon in 2008 which cited reduction of [[carbon black]] as a cost-effective way to reduce a major cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inece.org/climate/INECEClimateComplianceAlert_BlackCarbon.pdf "Jump-Starting Climate Protection: INECE Targets Compliance with Laws Controlling Black Carbon"] analysis by [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]], June 12, 2008, accessed April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;
{{cite journal
|last=Shepard
|first=Roger N.
|title=Circularity in judgments of relative pitch
|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
|volume=36
|issue=212
|date=1964
|pages=2346–2353}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?]. Journal of Organic Systems, 9 (1), pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Australia]] a Parliamentary Inquiry was set up in December 2017 to examine mechanisms for compensating farmers where there has been contamination by [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37501069/Compensation_for_GMO_contamination  Compensation for GMO contamination]. International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS) Newsletter, Issue 3: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Dual Segmented Langmuir Probe (DSLP)'''
&lt;ref&gt;[http://terezka.asu.cas.cz/proba2/index.htm DSLP Proba 2 homepage at Astronomical Institute &amp; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, AS CR]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is an instrument developed primarily by Czech researchers and engineers to study the magnetospheric background plasma flown on board the spacecraft of the European Space Agency ([[ESA]]) [[Proba-2|Proba 2]]. 
Data acquired by DSLP will be used to reach these specific scientific goals:

* ''Directional Measurements'': 
Contrary to classical Langmuir probes, the new DSLP concept of data acquisition from the independent segments will enable to study also plasma characteristics in different directions. This should provide for example estimations of plasma flow velocity. Typically in the presence of magnetic field, electron temperatures are observed to be slightly different in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. This temperature anisotropy should be measured with DSLP by way of directional data acquisition.
* ''Non-Maxwellian Features in Ionospheric Plasma'':
Classical theories for LPs are typically developed for plasmas in a thermodynamic equilibrium, that is for particle populations possessing Maxwellian velocity distribution functions. However, a thermodynamic equilibrium and thus a Maxwellian distribution is an idealized case while the real distribution in many plasma environments often exhibits various non-Maxwellian features, like loss-cone or flat-top distributions or high-energy tails. We intend to adapt the DSLP theoretical model in order to see whether such features exist also in ionospheric plasmas.
* ''Ionospheric Irregularities'': Ionosphere especially in the equatorial region possess several phenomena such equatorial ionization anomaly or ionospheric perturbations in auroral and cusp regions. The latitudinal distribution of these anomalies should be mapped during the whole mission. The effects are also highly dependent on space weather, on magnetospheric forces induced by solar, interplanetary and magnetospheric disturbances. Hence also coordination with [[LYRA]] and [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] (other [[Proba-2|Proba 2]] payload) measurements would be useful to find a correlation between particular solar events and ionospheric disturbances.
* ''Ionospheric Perturbations by Solar Events (CMEs)'': This scientific objective will use cooperation with [[LYRA]] and [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] experiments and further more enhance the sphere of interest. Detected solar event, if possible, should start DSLP burst measurement when the solar event affects the Earth.
* ''Mapping Bulk Plasma Parameters'': All acquired DSLP data will be used to map the bulk plasma parameters (primarily electron density and temperature) and to study their latitude and seasonal variations. 

The DSLP instrument consists of two Langmuir probes, electronics and small data processing unit. DSLP shares some interface, power and processing resources with TPMU experiment. DSLP has been developed on the basis of its predecessor ISL (Instrument Sonde de Langmuir), flown on the 
[[Demeter (satellite)|Demeter]] mission of CNES.

DSLP was developed by the consortium of 
[[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Astronomical
Institute]]
and Institute of Atmospheric Physics,
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic, Research and Scientific Support Department (RSSD) [[ESA]] ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands, Czech Space Research Centre (CSRC), Brno Czech Republic, and SPRINX Systems, Prague, Czech Republic.

To date the Company has 37,250 acres of bamboo farms under ownership, in Central American, Western and Southern Africa, with larger scale [[plantation]]s underway.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is a privately owned United States Company, registered in Delaware and with corporate headquarters located outside of Chicago, Illinois. It is a US Series LLC allowing each geographic region and individual bamboo plantation to be funded and operated separately but under the same umbrella.

The Company has been recognized for its social impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131017005822/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Wins-IAIR-Award-Sustainability|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Wins IAIR Award for Sustainability|website=Businesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created more than 750 jobs and operates in some of the poorest parts of the world in [[Nicaragua]], South Africa and [[Ghana]].

EcoPlanet Bamboo plants species of tropical clumping ([[sympodial]]) bamboos, using only highly degraded&lt;ref&gt;''EcoPlanet Bamboo uses the UNFCCC tool for the Identification of Degraded Land.''&lt;/ref&gt; and marginal land to produce a tree free, [[deforestation]] free fiber. The Company has developed a framework for what sustainability means in respect to [[bamboo]]. Farms reach maturity in 5–7 years and the fiber is targeted towards [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]] dependent on wood and fiber as their raw resource.

The company is highly decentralized with individual bamboo plantations operating under EcoPlanet Bamboo Groups standardized operational framework to achieve [[Forest restoration|Forest Landscape Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfrn.org/file.php/302/4.6-ecoplanet-bamboo.pdf|format=PDF|title=4.6 Commercial bamboo plantations as a tool for restoring landscapes|website=Etfrn.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full set of qualified managerial staff exists on each farm and is overseen by a core managerial team.

==Bamboo in China==
Although bamboo is a plant that has been grown and harvested in China for generations, it occurs only within a smallholder model. There are few commercial or large scale managed plantations. The majority of area under bamboo comprises plots of a few Mu in size, owned by individual farmers or families, and managed as part of a [[Crop diversity|diverse]] mix of livelihood crops. Throughout China bamboo has been planted only in areas not suitable for agriculture, which generally mean mountainous land that is often inaccessible. Most of China's bamboo industry is focused on a single iconic species – [[Phyllostachys edulis|Moso (''Phyllostachys edulis'')]]

The processing of bamboo in China is dominated by low and medium level processing, with a large focus on two very different markets (1) the global handicraft industry and (2) the production of [[Bamboo shoot|edible bamboo shoots]] for the food industry. In recent years there has been an increase in the production of [[bamboo floor]]ing.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is working in a different manner growing certified bamboo fiber for the [[pulp and paper industry]], textiles and [[Engineered wood|engineered timber]].

==Historical barriers to industrialization of bamboo==
EcoPlanet Bamboo claims to have overcome many barriers to industrialize bamboo as a commercial crop:
# A lack of planting material.  See “[[Bamboo#Mass flowering|bamboo mass flowering]]".
# Lack of knowledge on the growth, ecology and yields of bamboos other than Moso.
# High investment required to take bamboo through the 6–7 years required to reach maturity.
# Difficulty of operating in remote parts of the developing world.

==Bamboo sustainability==
EcoPlanet Bamboo is a triple bottom line company promoting the concept of conscious capitalism. The company has pioneered the concept of sustainability certification for commercially produced bamboo. Nicaraguan farms are certified under the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), the [[Verified Carbon Standard]] (VCS) and have gold level Climate Community Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) stamp of approval. EcoPlanet Bamboo is the first entity to have received these certifications for application to bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121115006752/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Acquires-FSC-Certification-Enabling-Supply|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Acquires FSC Certification, Enabling Supply of a Sustainable Alternative Fiber to US &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Multinational&amp;nbsp;Manufacturing Industries|website=Bsinesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company has been insured by the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency|World Bank's Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (MIGA)]], holding a $48&amp;nbsp;million policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agriinvestor.com/miga-increases-ecoplanet-bamboo-guarantee/|title=MIGA increases EcoPlanet Bamboo guarantee - Agri Investor|date=June 25, 2015|website=Agriinvestor.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIGA has featured EcoPlanet Bamboo for strong social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miga.org/Lists/General/CustomDisp.aspx?ID=1488|title=General|website=Miga.org|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euhemerism''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|h|iː|m|ər|ɪ|z|əm|,_|-|h|ɛ|m|-}}) is an approach to the interpretation of [[mythology]] in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural [[mores]]. It was named for the Greek mythographer [[Euhemerus]], who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'', euhemerism is termed the "historical theory" of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. ''Bulfinch's Mythology''. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of [[Xenophanes]], [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis: "Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete" The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337–340) p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] presented rationalized accounts of the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (''Histories'' I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (''Histories'' 2.118ff).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as [[Ennius]] and [[Antoine Banier]] identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to mythology'', [[Lewis Spence]], 1921, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In a scene described in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Socrates]] offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]:

{{quote|"{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Tell me, Socrates, isn't it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithyia away?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: So they say.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Couldn't this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.&lt;br&gt; {{smallcaps|Socrates}}: No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: I hadn't noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas..."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedr. 229b–d, translation taken from:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] abducting [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of "absurd forms" such as [[Centaurs]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] could not easily be explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 229d&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient [[skeptic]] philosophical tradition of [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] and the [[Cyrenaics]], Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of [[Greek mythology]] could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an [[atheism|atheist]] by his opponents, most notably [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deification===

Euhemerus' views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through [[apotheosis]]. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], the tyrant ruler of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus' views on the origin of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211–242.&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and "[[pharaoh|pharaoization]]" of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that [[Zeus]] was a mortal king who died on [[Crete]], and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete'', S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered [[Atheism|atheists]], and Epimenides called them all liars (see [[Epimenides paradox]]). [[Callimachus]], an opponent of Euhemerus' views on [[mythology]], argued that Zeus' Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

{{cquote|''Cretans always lie.'' For the Cretans even built a tomb,&lt;br&gt; 
Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Zeus''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A later Latin [[scholia|scholium]] on the ''Hymns'' of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: "The tomb of [[Minos]], the son of [[jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]" but over time the words "Minos, the son" wore away leaving only "the tomb of Jupiter".  This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the ''Coma Berenices'' of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the ''Encomium of Ptolemy'' by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Euhemerus, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century AD claimed that [[Pythagoras]] had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb's surface an inscription reading: "Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus".&lt;ref&gt;Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christians==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the [[Church Fathers]], embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s triumphant cry in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'': "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]], has a passage, {{bibleref|Wisdom|14:12–21}}, giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.{{wikisource|Wisdom (Bible)}}

===Early Christian apologists===

The [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologists]] deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of [[fable]]s of human invention. [[Cyprian]], a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay ''De idolorum vanitate'' ("On the Vanity of Idols") in AD 247 that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

{{quote|That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation.}}

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the [[apotheosis]] of [[Melicertes]] and [[Leucothea]]; "The Castors [i.e. [[Castor and Pollux]]] die by turns, that they may live," a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. "The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown," Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and [[Dionysus]] but showing that the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian's argument to marginalize the [[syncretism]] of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

{{quote|From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar.}}

Eusebius in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God [[Baʿal]] was a deified ruler and that the god [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] was the first Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in [[Tertullian]] (''De idololatria''), the ''Octavius'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] and in [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: "Contra Celsum" III 22–43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]]' dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. [[Isidore of Seville]], compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter ''De diis gentium''&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'', book viii, ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from [[Lactantius]], ''Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur.'' ("Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men.") Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore's euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in [[Petrus Comestor]]'s appendix to his much translated ''Historia scholastica'' (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan [[legend]], as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Seznec 1995:16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin of Braga]] in his ''De correctione rusticorum'' wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah's family who began to worship the [[Sun]] and stars instead of [[deity|God]]. In his view the Greek gods were deified descendants of [[Noah]] who were once real personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_|title=Chapter 4: Pagan Survivals in Galicia in the Sixth Century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to embrace euhemerism, such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Petrus Comestor]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Godfrey of Viterbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as [[Minerva]], [[Prometheus]], Atlas, [[Apollo]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] were all deified humans. – ''Opus Maius'', ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
“After all, it was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus' Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.” Other modern theorists labeled Euhemerism as a “subject of classical paganism that was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realization that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had  been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.” (John Daniel Cook)

===Christ myth theory===

In his 2011 book, ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', [[Robert M. Price]] supported the [[Christ myth theory]] and suggested that the process of searching for a historical Jesus was like euhemerism.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M, ( 2011) ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', American Atheist Press. {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}} p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snorri Sturluson's "euhemerism"==
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. [[Odin]], the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from [[Asia Minor]], tracing his ancestry back to [[Priam]], the king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. 
As Odin travels north to settle in the [[Nordic countries]], he establishes the royal families ruling in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] at the time:

{{quote|And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men.&lt;ref&gt;Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, ''Edda''. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while Snorri's euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') to hint that the 'divinisation' was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers.

==In the modern world==

Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the [[early modern period]] from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;For example in the preface to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid's pagan stories. He argues: 'The true and everliving God the [[Paynim]]s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow'.&lt;/ref&gt; to modern times. In 1711, the French historian [[Antoine Banier]] in his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' ("The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise of modern mythology, 1680–1860'', Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson'', Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Bryant]]'s ''A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, [[George Stanley Faber]] was another Biblical euhemerist. His work ''The Origin of Pagan Idolatry'' (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of [[Homer]]. He excavated [[Troy]] and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the [[Mask of Agamemnon]] and [[Priam's Treasure]].

[[Herbert Spencer]] embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]]. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer [[Robert Graves]] offered many such "euhemerist" interpretations in his telling of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn= 9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).

'''Evolutionary musicology''' is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing.

== History ==
The origins of the field can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]] who wrote in his [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Descent of Man]]:
: "When we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially exerted during the courtship of the sexes,—would have expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,—and would have served as a challenge to rivals.  It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of musical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=[[Charles Darwin]]|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dscmn10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of a musical protolanguage has been revived and re-discovered repeatedly, often without attribution to Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Music|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |author=Nils L. Wallin, Björn Merker, and Steven Brown (Editors)|isbn=0-262-23206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen, ''The Singing Neanderthals: the Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body'', Harvard University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of music ==
{{See also|Prehistoric music|Music archaeology|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
Two major topics for any subfield of [[evolutionary psychology]] are the adaptive function (if any) and phylogenetic history of the mechanism or behavior of interest including when music arose in human ancestry and from what ancestral traits it developed. Current debate addresses each of these.

One part of the adaptive function question is whether music constitutes an evolutionary [[adaptation]] or [[exaptation]] (i.e. by-product of evolution). [[Steven Pinker]], in his book ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', for example, argues that music is merely "auditory [[cheesecake]]"—it was evolutionarily adaptive to have a preference for fat and sugar but cheesecake did not play a role in that selection process. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Perlovsky L. Music. Cognitive Function, Origin, And Evolution Of Musical Emotions. WebmedCentral PSYCHOLOGY 2011;2(2):WMC001494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Abbott. 2002. Neurobiology: Music, maestro, please!

Adaptation, on the other hand, is highlighted in hypotheses such as the one by Edward Hagen and Gregory Bryant which posits that human music evolved from animal territorial signals, eventually becoming a method of signaling a group's social cohesion to other groups for the purposes of making beneficial multi-group alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|author-link=|last2=Bryant|first2=Gregory A|author2-link=|title=Music and dance as a coalition signaling system|journal=Human Nature|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–51|year=2003|url=http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1015-z|id=|access-date=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612013500/http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|archive-date=12 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagen |first=Edward H |author2=Hammerstein P |year=2009 |title=Did Neanderthals and other early humans sing? Seeking the biological roots of music in the loud calls of primates, lions, hyenas, and wolves |journal=Musicae Scientiae |url=http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/musicae.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The bipedalism hypothesis===
The evolutionary switch to bipedalism may have influenced the origins of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities|journal=Animal Cognition|date=August 2013|doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z|volume=17|pages=1–14|pmc=3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background is that noise of locomotion and ventilation may mask critical auditory information. Human locomotion is likely to produce more predictable sounds than those of non-human primates. Predictable locomotion sounds may have improved our capacity of entrainment to external rhythms and to feel the beat in music. A sense of rhythm could aid the brain in distinguishing among sounds arising from discrete sources and also help individuals to synchronize their movements with one another. Synchronization of group movement may improve perception by providing periods of relative silence and by facilitating auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Possible functions of the octavolateralis system in fish schooling|journal=Fish and Fisheries|year=2009|volume=10|pages=344–355|doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Incidental sounds of locomotion in animal cognition|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10071-011-0433-2|pmc=3249174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of such skills to early human ancestors may have been keener detection of prey or stalkers and enhanced communication. Thus, bipedal walking may have influenced the development of entrainment in humans and thereby the evolution of rhythmic abilities. Primitive hominids lived and moved around in small groups. The noise generated by the locomotion of two or more individuals can result in a complicated mix of footsteps, breathing, movements against vegetation, echoes, etc. The ability to perceive differences in pitch, rhythm, and harmonies, i.e. “musicality,” could help the brain to distinguish among sounds arising from discrete sources, and also help the individual to synchronize movements with the group. Endurance and an interest in listening might, for the same reasons, have been associated with survival advantages eventually resulting in adaptive selection for rhythmic and musical abilities and reinforcement of such abilities. Listening to music seems to stimulate release of dopamine. Rhythmic group locomotion combined with attentive listening in nature may have resulted in reinforcement through dopamine release. A primarily survival-based behavior may eventually have attained similarities to [[dance]] and music, due to such reinforcement mechanisms . Since music may facilitate social cohesion, improve group effort, reduce conflict, facilitate perceptual and motor skill development, and improve trans-generational communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huron|first=David|title=Is music an evolutionary adaptation?|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2001|volume=930|pages=43–61|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05724.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; music-like behavior may at some stage have become incorporated into human culture.

Another proposed adaptive function is creating intra-group bonding. In this aspect it has been seen as complementary to language by creating strong positive emotions while not having a specific message people may disagree on. Music's ability to cause [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]] (synchronization of behavior of different organisms by a regular beat) has also been pointed out. A different explanation is that signaling fitness and creativity by the producer or performer in order to attract mates. Still another is that music may have developed from human mother-infant auditory interactions ([[motherese]]) since humans have a very long period of infant and child development, infants can perceive musical features, and some infant-mother auditory interaction have resemblances to music.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 45 Music and cognitive evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the problem in the debate is that music, like any complex cognitive function, is not a holistic entity but rather [[Modularity of mind|modular]]&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;—perception and production of [[rhythm]], [[melody|melodies]], [[harmony]] and other musical parameters may thus involve multiple cognitive functions with possibly quite distinct evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H. (ed.) (2018). The Origins of Musicality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Musilanguage hypothesis ===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2011}}
"Musilanguage" is a term coined by Steven Brown to describe his hypothesis of the ancestral human traits that evolved into language and musical abilities. It is both a model of musical  and linguistic evolution and a term coined to describe a certain stage in that evolution. Brown argues that both music and human language have origins in a  "musilanguage" stage of evolution and that the structural features shared by music and language are not the results of mere chance parallelism, nor are they a function of one system emerging from the other. This model argues that "music emphasizes sound as emotive meaning and language emphasizes sound as referential meaning."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown S|veditors=Wallin NL, Merker B, Brown S |date=1999-12-03|chapter=The "Musilanguage" Model of Music Evolution|title=The Origins of Music|isbn=0-262-23206-5|publisher=The MIT Press|pages=271&amp;ndash;301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musilanguage model is a structural model of music evolution, meaning that it views music's acoustic properties as effects of homologous precursor functions.  This can be contrasted with functional models of music evolution, which view music's innate physical properties to be determined by its adaptive roles.

The musilanguage evolutionary stage is argued to exhibit three properties found in both music and language: lexical tone, combinatorial phrase formation, and expressive phrasing mechanisms.  Many of these ideas have their roots in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music. 
::Lexical tone refers to the pitch of speech as a vehicle for semantic meaning.  The importance of pitch to conveying musical ideas is well-known, but the linguistic importance of pitch is less obvious.  [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonal language]]s such as Thai and Cantonese, wherein the lexical meaning of a sound depends heavily on its pitch relative to other sounds, are seen as evolutionary artifacts of musilanguage.  Non-tonal, or "intonation" languages, which do not depend heavily on pitch for lexical meaning, are seen as evolutionary late-comers which have discarded their dependence on tone.  Intermediate states, known as [[pitch accent]] languages, which exhibit some lexical dependence on tone, but also depend heavily on intonation, are exemplified by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language]].

::Combinatorial formation refers to the ability to form small phrases from different tonal elements.  These phrases must be able to exhibit melodic, rhythmic, and semantic variation, and must be able to combine with other phrases to create global [[melodic formula]]s capable of conveying emotive meaning.  Examples in modern speech would be the rules for arranging letters to form words and then words to form sentences.  In music, the notes of different scales are combined according to their own unique rules to form larger musical ideas.

::Expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] is the device by which expressive emphasis can be added to the phrases, both at a local (in the sense of individual units) and global (in the sense of phrases) level.  There are numerous ways this can occur in both speech and music that exhibit interesting parallels.  For instance, the increase in the amplitude of a sound being played by an instrument accents that sound much the same way that an increase in amplitude can emphasize a particular point in speech.  Similarly, speaking very rapidly often creates a frenzied effect that mirrors that of a fast and agitated musical passage.

===AVID model of music evolution===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that music (as well as several other universal elements of contemporary human culture, including [[dance]] and [[body painting]]) was part of a predator control system used by early [[hominids]]. He suggested that rhythmic loud singing and drumming, together with the threatening rhythmic body movements and body painting, was the core element of the ancient "Audio-Visual Intimidating Display" (AVID).&lt;ref&gt;Jordania J. ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech'' (2006) Logos&lt;/ref&gt; AVID  was also a key factor in putting the hominid group into a specific [[altered state of consciousness]] which he calls  "battle trance" where they would not feel fear and pain, and would be religiously dedicated to group interests. Jordania suggested that listening and dancing to the sounds of loud rhythmic rock music, used in many contemporary combat units before the combat missions is directly related to this.&lt;ref&gt;Jordania, J. (2009) ''Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history'' 1: 272-277&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the defense from predators, Jordania suggested that this system was the core strategy to obtain food via confrontational, or aggressive [[scavenging]].

Apart from loud rhythmic singing-stomping-dancing, Jordania also suggested that soft [[humming]] could have played an important role in the early human ([[hominid]]) evolution as [[contact calls]]. Many [[social animals]] produce seemingly haphazard and indistinctive sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business ([[foraging]], feeding). These sounds have two functions: (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger, and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds, movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''Descent of Men'', 2004:123&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many [[social animals]], silence can be a sign of danger, and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in [[music therapy]], [[lullaby|lullabies]])

With the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] in the [[Renaissance]], the poetry of [[Ovid]] became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of '''[[Greek mythology]]''' through subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="BrBurn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;br /&gt;* L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledas]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Through the medium of [[Latin]] and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Dante]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature.  Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, [[Chaucer]], the [[Elizabethan]]s and [[John Milton]] were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Robert Bridges]] turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. [[Jean Racine]] in [[France]] and [[Goethe]] in [[Germany]] revived Greek drama.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Racine reworked the ancient myths &amp;mdash; including those of [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaidra]], [[Andromache]], Oedipus and [[Iphigeneia]] &amp;mdash; to new purpose.&lt;ref name="Burn75"&gt;L.

[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Francisco Goya, [[Europa (mythology)|''The rape of Europa'']] ''(El rapto de Europa),'' 1772]]
In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread throughout Europe.  It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the [[libretti]] for [[Handel]]'s operas ''[[Admeto]]'' and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn75" /&gt; By the end of the century, [[Romanticism]] initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including  Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and [[Homer]]'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as [[Keats]], [[Byron]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Burn75-76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[poet laureate]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of [[King Arthur]] are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the [[Parthenon marbles]] in 1816; many of the "Greek" paintings of [[Lord Leighton]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.&lt;ref name="Burn76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

American authors of the 19th century, such as [[Thomas Bulfinch]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.&lt;ref name="Klatt"&gt;Klatt-Brazouski, ''Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulfinch, "The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste."&lt;ref name="Bulfinchintroduction"&gt;T. Bulfinch (1855).

Sanborn, Carter, and Bazin.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Jean Giraudoux]] in France, [[Eugene O'Neill]] in America, and [[T. S. Eliot]] in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish [[James Joyce]] and the French [[André Gide]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20333">The '''green gross domestic product''' ('''green GDP''' or '''GGDP''') is an index of [[economic growth]] with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country's conventional [[GDP]]. Green GDP monetizes the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], and accounts for costs caused by [[climate change]]. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as "[[waste]] [[per capita]]" or "[[carbon dioxide emissions]] per year"), which may be aggregated to indices such as the "[[Sustainable Development Index]]".

==Calculation==

Calculating green GDP requires that net [[natural capital]] consumption, including [[resource depletion]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[environmental protection|protective]] and [[environmental restoration|restorative]] environmental initiatives, be subtracted from traditional GDP.&lt;ref name="Fitoussi"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [http://templatelab.com/rapport-anglais/ "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some early calculations of green GDP take into account one or two but not all environmental adjustments. These calculations can also be applied to [[net domestic product]] (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP. In each case, it is necessary to convert the resource activity into a monetary value, since it is in this manner that indicators are generally expressed in national accounts.

==Rationale==

The motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP has as an indicator of [[economic performance]] and [[social progress]]. It only assesses gross output, and does not have a mechanism for identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output.&lt;ref name="WAVES"/&gt; This is problematic because it cannot account for permanent or significant depletion or replenishment of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of [[income]] generated in a country is [[sustainable]]. Richard Stone, one of the creators the original GDP indicator, suggested that while "the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-[[demographic]] and environmental phenomenon", he had done little work in the area of [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1984/stone-lecture.pdf "The Accounts of Society"], "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1984", 8 December 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, natural capital is poorly represented in GDP; resources are not adequately considered as economic assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy "Policy Recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075450/http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy |date=2013-04-20 }}, "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to their costs, companies and policy makers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands and agriculture are unaccounted for or otherwise hidden because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets.&lt;ref name="WAVES"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/natural-capital-accounting?active=1 "Natural Capital Accounting"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the impact that the [[depletion of natural resources]] or increases in [[pollution]] can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.&lt;ref name="WAVES" /&gt;

The need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sesric.org/files/article/52.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Growth and Development with Special Reference to a System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA): The Indonesian Experience"], "Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries"&lt;/ref&gt; GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries' abilities to manage their economies and resources.

==History==
Many economists, scientists and other scholars have theorized about adjusting [[macroeconomic]] [[economic indicator|indicator]]s to account for [[environmental change]]. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).&lt;ref&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811080135/http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf |date=2007-08-11 }}, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW).&lt;ref name="MEW"&gt;William Nordhaus and James Tobin, [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf "Is Growth Obsolete?"], National Bureau of Economic Research, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work and [[environmental damage]]s.&lt;ref name="MEW" /&gt; They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.

Repetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance.&lt;ref name="Jeroen"&gt;Jeroen van den Bergh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6bwKkM1GC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into "aggregate measures of economic performance".&lt;ref name="Jeroen" /&gt;

In their seminal report, "Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development", Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several [[UNEP]]-[[World Bank]] sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop [[environmental accounting]] as a [[public policy]] tool.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;Edited by Yusuf J. Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/12/03/000178830_98101901491957/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development"], The World Bank, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of all of the authors' arguments is that the [[system of national accounts]] (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy in their respective chapters.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

In "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation", John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock by representing the use of natural resources as "economic depreciation magnitudes".&lt;ref&gt;John Hartwick, [http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/working_papers/papers/qed_wp_771.pdf "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation"], Queen's University, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]] (SEEA), published by the [[United Nations]] as an appendix to the 1993 SNA.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the "Global Initiatives" section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green [[GDP]] is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.&lt;ref&gt;London Group on Environmental Accounting, [http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-ve-seea.pdf "Why We Need the SEEA"], ''Beyond GDP'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).

In 1993, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP and that's where things stand today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | date=April 9, 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602190235/http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph (2008), presentation in New York, 5 Feb 2008, "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q_PA_czIKM&amp;feature=related video from 3:18]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 [[ecosystem services]] for 16 biomes.&lt;ref name="Costanza"&gt;Costanza et al., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6630/abs/387253a0.html "The Value of the World's Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital"], ''Nature'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals' "willingness-to-pay" for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt;

Kunte et al. (1998) use their paper "Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results" to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a "practical [and necessary] exercise".&lt;ref name="Kunte"&gt;Kunte et al., [http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/archive/Framework/Kunte_etal_1998.PDF "Estimating National Wealth"], The World Bank, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. "Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction."&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt; Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt;

Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3147043 "Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], National Academy Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high priority goals for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus" /&gt; One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.

In 2004, [[Wen Jiabao]], the Chinese premier, announced that the green [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua (2007) "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm Call for return to green accounting]", ''China Daily'', 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and [[resource depletion]] was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J. and Yardley, J. (2007) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html Choking on Growth: As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes]", ''The New York Times'', 26 Aug 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have for the last decade ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, Elizabeth (2007) "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html Green GDP: Accounting for the Environment in China]", ''China from the Inside'', U.S. Public Broadcasting System.&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.

The most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country's environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that "It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country's chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India's GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of [[environmental degradation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-to-release--green-GDP--data-from-2015/544338/|title=India to release green GDP data from 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]'s (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of [[UNEP]] and works in cooperation with the [[United Nations Global Compact]]. It produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting&amp;mdash;also known as [[ecological footprint]] reporting, [[Environmental Social and Corporate Governance|environmental social governance]] (ESG) reporting, [[triple bottom line]] (TBL) reporting, and [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.

==Current debate==

Some critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.

Supporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.

A second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi remark that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin's SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability."&lt;ref name="Fitoussi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Hinman collator''', an early [[optical collator]], was an [[opto-mechanical]] device for comparing pairs of documents for differences in the text. Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of [[Literature|literary]] works.

Invented by [[Charlton Hinman]] in the late 1940s, the device used [[light bulb|lights]] and [[mirror]]s to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]] of texts by eye.

The idea built on earlier work such as [[Carl Pulfrich|Carl Pulfrich's]] [[blink comparator]] used to help identify the former planet [[Pluto]], and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during [[World War II]].

Hinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The [[printing]] and [[bookbinding]] processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], and subsequently wrote about his findings in ''Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collation.folger.edu/2011/08/welcome-to-the-collation/ |title=Welcome to The Collation |last1=Werner |first1=Sarah |date=August 18, 2011 |website=The Collation |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The device was developed further by Randall McLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Daniel. [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9706/fieldnotes.html ''Through the looking glass.''] Lingua franca, June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

== East Asia ==
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese bamboo book]]

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD.

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

=== Copying and conserving books ===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Woodblock printing ==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing. "On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries", in ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', 1997, Vol. 42, No. 12: 976–981. ISSN 1001-6538. Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

Rightreading.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea - Silla. Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150" /&gt;

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

== Movable type ==
{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], there is mention of [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

=== Movable type in Japan ===
Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961).

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

The '''Hockney–Falco thesis''' is a theory of [[art history]], advanced by artist [[David Hockney]] and physicist [[Charles M. Falco]]. Both claimed that advances in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] and accuracy in the history of Western art since the [[Renaissance]] were primarily the result of [[optical instrument]]s such as the [[camera obscura]], [[camera lucida]], and [[curved mirror]]s, rather than solely due to the development of [[artist]]ic technique and skill. Nineteenth-century artists' use of photography had been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Aaron Scharf]]'s 1968 book ''Art and Photography'' (Allen Lane, The Penguin Press), referred to by Hockney in his 1977 painting ''My Parents'' (Tate, London) in which his father attentively reads the volume. Scharf notes in his introduction (p.1); 'In 1568 Daniele Barbaro, the Venetian writer on architecture, recommended the camera Obscura as an aid to artists: "By holding the paper steady you can trace the whole perspective outline with a pen, shade it, and delicately colour it from nature."'&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 book, ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', Hockney analyzed the work of the [[Old Masters]] and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by "eyeballing it".  Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods. The hypothesis led to a variety of conferences and heated discussions.

==Setup of the 2001 publication==
Part of Hockney's work involved collaboration with Charles Falco, a [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter physicist]] and an expert in [[optics]].  While the use of optical aids would generally enhance accuracy, Falco calculated the types of [[distortion]] that would result from specific optical devices; Hockney and Falco argued that such errors could in fact be found in the work of some of the Old Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Falco, [http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220210253/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html |date=February 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Hockney's book prompted intense and sustained debate among artists, art historians, and a wide variety of other scholars.  In particular, it has spurred increased interest in the actual methods and techniques of artists among scientists and [[history of science|historians of science]], as well as general historians and [[art historian]]s.  The latter have in general reacted unfavorably, interpreting the Hockney–Falco thesis as an accusation that the Old Masters "cheated" and intentionally obscured their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicist David G. Stork and several co-authors have argued against the Hockney–Falco thesis from a technical standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Criminisi |first2=David G. |last2=Stork |chapter=Did the great masters use optical projections while painting?

Hockney and Falco's theory has already inspired an increase in research regarding the use of optics throughout the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punk Playthings: Provocations for 21st Century Game Makers|last=Taylor|first=Sean|last2=Lowthorpe|first2=Chris|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=9781315350035|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there was the case of the decade-long research on [[Rembrandt]]'s works conducted by painter Francis O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Neill|first=Francis|last2=Palazzo-Corner|first2=Sofia|date=August 2016|title=Rembrandt’s self-portraits|url=|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the published paper he wrote with Sofia Palazzo Corner entitled, ''Rembrandt's Self-portraits'', O'Neill presented recurring themes in the painter's works that serve as evidence in his use of mirrors, particularly, in his self-portraits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/science/rembrandt-old-master-optics-mirrors.html|title=The Mirrors Behind Rembrandt’s Self-Portraits|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=July 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the use of [[chiaroscuro]], which is a signature of the lighting conditions necessary for projections as well as Rembrandt's off-center gaze in his self-portraits, which - according to O'Neill - indicated that the artist might have been looking at a projection surface off to the side rather than straight onto a flat mirror.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origins of the thesis==
As described in ''Secret Knowledge'', in January 1999 during a visit to the [[National Gallery, London]], Hockney conceived of the idea that optical aids were the key factor in the development of artistic realism.  He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and became convinced that Ingres had used a [[camera lucida]] or similar device.  From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of optical aids in earlier paintings, creating what he called the ''Great Wall'' in his studio  by organizing images of great realistic art by time period.  What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney–Falco thesis.&lt;ref name=svensixseven&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Falco and Hockney published an analysis ("Optical Insights into Renaissance Art") of the likely use of concave mirrors in Jan van Eyck's work in ''Optics &amp; Photonics News'', vol. 11.  In 2001, Hockney published an extended form of his argument in ''Secret Knowledge''.

The hypothesis that technology was used in the production of Renaissance Art was not much in dispute in early studies and literature.&lt;ref name=id&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Don Ihde |first=Don |last=Ihde |chapter=Art Precedes Science: or Did the Camera Obscura Invent Modern Science? |editor-first=Helmar |editor-last=Schramm |editor2-first=Ludger |editor2-last=Schwarte |editor3-first=Jan |editor3-last=Lazardzig |title=Instruments in Art and Science: On the Architectonics of Cultural Boundaries in the 17th Century |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP-FNOpBCGUC&amp;pg=PA383 |year=2008 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-020240-3 |pages=384–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] contained an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cited [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; The discussion started by the Hockney–Falco thesis ignored the abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices, at least in the Renaissance, and, e.g., [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt;

==Hockney's argument==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 008.jpg|thumb|Detail of the chandelier and mirror from Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', one of Hockney's key examples]]
In ''Secret Knowledge'', Hockney argues that early [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance artists]] such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Lorenzo Lotto]] used concave mirrors; as evidence, he points to the chandelier in Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', the ear in Van Eyck's [[portrait of Cardinal Albergati]], and the carpet in Lotto's ''Husband and Wife''.  Hockney suggests that later artists, beginning with [[Caravaggio]], used [[convex mirrors]] as well, to achieve a large field of view.

''Secret Knowledge'' recounts Hockney's search for evidence of optical aids in the work of earlier artists, including the assembly of a "Great Wall" of the [[history of Western art]].  The 15th century work of Jan van Eyck seems to be the turning point, he argues, after which elements of realism became increasingly prominent.  He correlates shifts toward increased realism with advances in optical technologies.  The argument of ''Secret Knowledge'' is primarily a visual one, as Hockney was largely unable to determine when and how optical aids were used by textual or direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jane |last=Partner |title=Review: David Hockney: Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |journal=Cambridge Quarterly |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=345–9 |year=2002 |doi=10.1093/camqtly/31.4.345 |url=http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/345.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falco and Ibn al-Haytham==
At a scientific conference in February 2007, Falco further argued that the Arabic physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]]'s (965–1040) work on [[optics]], in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', may have influenced the use of optical aids by Renaissance artists. Falco said that his and Hockney's examples of Renaissance art "demonstrate a continuum in the use of optics by artists from c. 1430, arguably initiated as a result of Ibn al-Haytham's influence, until today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles M.

==Criticism==
===Artist's skill===
Art historians and others have criticized Hockney's argument on the grounds that the use of optical aids, though well-established in individual cases, has little value for explaining the overall development of Western art, and that historical records and paintings and photographs of art studios (sans optical devices), as well as present-day realist artists, demonstrate that high levels of realism are possible without optical aids.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Optical distortion===
In addition to incredulity on the part of art historians and critics of modern art, some of the harshest criticism of the Hockney–Falco thesis came from another expert in optics, image processing and pattern recognition, David G. Stork.  Stork analyzed the images used by Falco and Hockney, and came to the conclusion that they do not demonstrate the kinds of optical distortion that curved mirrors or converging lenses would cause.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Stork, [http://www.diatrope.com/stork/FAQs.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Falco has claimed that Stork's published criticisms have relied on fabricated data and misrepresentations of Hockney and Falco's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rex |last=Dalton |title=Tempers blaze over artistic integrity |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7081 |page=134 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/440134a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7081/full/440134a.html |pmid=16525432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stork has rebutted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David G. |last=Stork |first2=Marco |last2=Duarte |title=Revisiting computer vision and art |journal=IEEE Multimedia |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=108–9 |year=2007 |doi=10.1109/MMUL.2007.62 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4287425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance optics===
Critics of the Hockney–Falco theory claim that the quality of mirrors and optical glass for the period before 1550 and a lack of textual evidence (excluding paintings themselves as "documentary evidence") of their use for image projection during this period casts doubt on the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics|last=Smith|first=Mark|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=9780226174761|location=Chicago|pages=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are more inclined to agree about the possible relevance of the thesis between 1550 and the invention of the telescope, and cautiously supportive after that period, when there clearly was interest and capacity to project realistic images; 17th century painters such as [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Gaspar van Wittel]] used optical devices in a variety of ways, though not the ways postulated by Hockney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Dupré |title=Introduction. The Hockney–Falco Thesis: Constraints and Opportunities |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088141 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088141 |jstor=4130307 |ref=harv}} pp. 128–135; quotation from p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the technical optical arguments aside, historians of science investigated several aspects of the historical plausibility of the thesis in a 2005 set of articles in ''Early Science and Medicine''.  In his introduction to the volume, Sven Dupré claimed the Hockney–Falco analysis rests heavily on a small number of examples, "a few dozen square centimeters" of canvas that seem to show signs that optical devices were used.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Image projection===
&lt;!--One critic{{Who|date=October 2014}} argued that the optical ideas of opticians at the time were somewhat incompatible with image projection, though artists might have been more receptive.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}  Two other scholars{{Who|date=October 2014}} showed that Renaissance painting treatises and Leonardo's manuscripts also lack any reference to image projection.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}} However, his--&gt;Leonardo's notebooks include several designs for creating concave mirrors&lt;!--, even if this alone is not evidence of their use for image projection--&gt;. Leonardo also describes a [[camera obscura]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' of 1478–1519.

The camera obscura was well known for centuries and documented by [[Ibn al-Haitham]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' of 1011–1021. In 13th-century England [[Roger Bacon]] described the use of a camera obscura for the safe observation of [[solar eclipses]], exactly because the viewer looks at the projected image and not the sun itself.

David Lindberg's ''A Catalogue of Medieval and Renaissance Optical Manuscripts'' (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974) lists 61 manuscripts written in the years 1000–1425. These manuscripts not only describe methods for making mirrors and parabolic mirrors but also discuss their use for image projection.

Schechner claimed that surviving glassware from the 15th and 16th centuries is far too imperfect to have been used to create realistic images, while "even thinking about projecting images was alien to the contemporary conceptual frame of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sara J. |last=Schechner |title=Between Knowing and Doing: Mirrors and their Imperfections in the Renaissance |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=137–162 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088187 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088187 |jstor=4130308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vincent Ilardi, a historian of Renaissance optical glass, subsequently argued against Schechner's conclusions based on surviving glassware, suggesting that the present condition of Renaissance glassware is not likely to reflect the optical quality of such glassware when it was new.  Ilardi documents [[Lorenzo Lotto]]'s purchase of a high-priced crystal mirror in 1549, bolstering the Hockney–Falco thesis in Lotto's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vincent |last=Ilardi |title=Renaissance Vision, From Spectacles to Telescopes |series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=2007 |isbn=0-87169-259-7 |pages=197–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, even normal eyeglasses (spectacles) can also project images of sufficient optical quality to support the Hockney–Falco thesis and such eyeglasses, along with magnifying glasses and mirrors, were not only available at the time, but actually pictured in 14th century paintings by artists such as [[Tommaso da Modena]].

Dutch draper and pioneering microbiologist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723), a contemporary of artist Vermeer (and an executor for Vermeer when he died in 1675) in Delft was known to have exceptional lens making skills, having created single small lenses capable of 200x magnification, far exceeding those of more complex compound microscopes of the period. Indeed, his feats of lens making were not matched for a considerable time as he kept aspects of their construction secret; in the 1950s, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing to recreate Leeuwenhoek design microscopes.  It was long believed that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a master lens grinder (a notion repeated in the recent BBC television documentary "Cell"). However, it is now believed{{By whom|date=October 2014}} that he came upon a relatively simple method of making small, high quality glass spheres by heating and manipulating a small rod of soda lime glass.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

===Metal mirrors===
On his website, Falco also claims Schechner overlooked manuscript evidence for the use of mirrors made from steel and other metals, as well as numerous metal artifacts that belie the claim that sufficiently large and reflective metal mirrors were unavailable, and that other contributors to the ''Early Science and Medicine'' volume relied on Schechner's mistaken work in dismissing the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Charles Falco|title=Objections |url=http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |accessdate=April 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625201014/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |archivedate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier evidence of the use of optical tools==
[[File:Annunciation_-_Virgin_and_Angel_-_Jan_van_Eyck_-_1434_-_NG_Wash_DC.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' (van Eyck, Washington)]] with three crown glass windows behind Mary]]
[[File:The_Arnolfini_Portrait,_détail_(2).jpg|thumb|Mirror depicted in the 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'']]
[[Don Ihde]] called the hypothesis being 'hyped' and referred to clear evidence about the use of optical tools by, e.g., [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and others. As well the 1929 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref name=id/&gt; contains an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cites [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; Ihde states abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices at least in the Renaissance and e.g. in [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt; [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 painting ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' shows a convex mirror in the centre of the painting. Van Eyck also left his signature above this mirror,&lt;ref name=delft&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Huerta |title=Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers : the Parallel Search for Knowledge During the Age of Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIelMWzUR6gC |year=2003 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |isbn=978-0-8387-5538-9}} the book mentions various (previous) studies stating a broad use of technology in the Renaissance and does not refer to the hypothesis and the hype around it at all&lt;/ref&gt; showing the importance of the tool. The painting includes a [[Crown glass (window)|crown glass window]] in the upper left side, a rather expensive luxury at the time.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The message board love-shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy of potential partners to discuss their situations.&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community. The subreddit was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other violence, and were misogynistic and often racist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html|title=Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; One post titled "general question about how rapists get caught" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41926687|title=Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that would ban "content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  and banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under its purview.

==Lexicology==
The term "involuntary celibate" (shortened to "incel") refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, a state they describe as ''inceldom''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; or ''incelibacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/incel-meaning-rebellion-alex-minassian-elliot-rodger-reddit.html|title=When a Mass Murderer Has a Cult Following|last=Futrelle|first=David|date=April 27, 2018|website=The Cut|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms, such as "love-shy" (describing those with [[social anxiety]] or excessive shyness preventing romantic success),&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Jennifer L.|last2=Rapee|first2=Ronald M.|date=2000|title=The Origins of Social Phobia|journal=[[Behavior Modification (journal)|Behavior Modification]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=102–129|doi=10.1177/0145445500241006|pmid=10641370}}&lt;/ref&gt; "FA" (short for "forever alone"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/05/04/loneliest-generation-social-media/581306002/|title=Andreatta: Feeling lonely?

On December 7, 2017, William Atchison killed two people before killing himself in [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]], [[New Mexico]], in a [[Aztec High School shooting|shooting at Aztec High School]], where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym "Elliot Rodger" on several online forums, and praised "the supreme gentleman" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since been adopted as a moniker by incel communities).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|last=Hankes|first=Keegan|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|access-date=May 14, 2018|last2=Amend|first2=Alex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz killed seventeen people and injured seventeen others in a [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School]] in [[Parkland, Florida|Parkland]], [[Florida]] before being arrested.

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (who banned the /r/incels community in 2017 but has declined to ban another incel subreddit) and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; [[Cloudflare]], which provides services including [[DDoS mitigation|DDoS protection]] and [[Cache (computing)|caching]] so that webpages are still accessible when a site is offline, has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against [[downtime]] even when webhosts have terminated service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-cloudfare-online-content-protection_us_5b491632e4b022fdcc597327|title=From Nazis To Incels: How One Tech Company Helps Hate Groups Thrive|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 25, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its "breathless" coverage, normalizing incel communities by describing them as "sexually frustrated", and directing readers to incel communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/toronto-attack-incel-alek-minassian|title=After the Toronto attack don't explain Incel ideology, ban it|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporting has also been criticized for [[victim blaming]] by implying that women and peers who rejected the attackers held some responsibility for provoking the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/21/no-girls-and-women-dont-provoke-mass-murderers/|title=No, girls and women don't 'provoke' mass murderers|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=May 21, 2018|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44321469|title=The problem with mass shootings and the media|last=Cooper|first=Kelly-Leigh|date=May 31, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/Upload/Documents/FINAL_WEB_POLICY_FRAMEWORK_30_NOV_2015.pdf Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD)]''' is a dynamic document created to help governments formulate sound investment policy, especially [[international investment agreement]]s (IIAs), that capitalize on [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) for [[sustainable development]]. It was prepared by the Division on Investment and Enterprise (DIAE) of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). IPFSD is not a negotiated text or undertaking between States; but rather an initiative by the UNCTAD Secretariat that represents expert guidance while leaving domestic policy makers free to ''adapt and adopt.'' IPFSD is the result of numerous consultations with experts and is intended as a platform to provide for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders. The main objective of the IPFSD is to create a balance between the rights and obligations of States and investors while maintaining attractive investment environments.

In the face of persistent global economic and social challenges, UNCTAD's IPFSD intends to:

*Promote a new generation of investment agreements by pursuing a broader development agenda; and
*Offer guidance to policymakers when formulating their national and international investment policies.

To that end, IPFSD defines eleven critical Core Principles. Flowing from these Core Principles IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policy including clause-by-clause options for negotiators to enhance the [[sustainable development]] value of domestic investment policies.

== Background to the IPFSD ==

IPFSD has grown out of a long precedent of [[UN]] Member States calling for sustainable economic development, an understanding that investment is a critical aspect of [[sustainable development]], and UNCTAD's three-and-a-half decades of experience in research and policy analysis.

The [[UN Charter]] promotes, ''inter alia'', the goal of economic and social progress. The [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The “Monterrey Consensus” of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate. The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for [[sustainable development]], which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth.

Several other international instruments inspired the Core Principles that make up the IPFSD. They comprise, in particular, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], the Convention on the Establishment of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the [[World Bank]] Guidelines, the [[UN Global Compact]] and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and social policy and several [[WTO]]-related agreements, including the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], the [[TRIMs]] Agreement and the Agreement on Government Procurement.

== Structure and components of the IPFSD ==
[[File:IPFSD Structure.jpg|450px|thumbnail|right]]
The IPFSD consists of eleven core principles which aim to guide the investment policy underlying IIAs. Flowing from these core principles, the IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policies. The IPFSD proposes clause-by-clause options for negotiators to strengthen the [[sustainable development]] aspects of IIAs.

IPFSD also offers an interactive online platform giving stakeholders the opportunity to critically assess policy guidelines and recommend any appropriate changes.

=== The Core Principles ===

The eleven core principles of the IPFSD are:
 
# Investment for sustainable development
# 
# Policy coherence
# 
# Public governance and institutions
# 
# Dynamic Policymaking
# 
# Balanced rights and obligations
# 
# Right to regulate
# 
# Openness to investment
# 
# Investment protection and treatment 
# 
# Investment promotion and facilitation
# 
# Corporate governance and responsibility 
# 
# International cooperation

=== National Investment Policy: Guidelines ===
The national investment policy guidelines translate the core principles for investment policy making into concrete guidelines at the national level, with a view to addressing specific policy changes. 
These guidelines are designed to ensure that investment policy is coherent with the overarching development strategy of countries, enhance the sustainable development impact of investment and promote responsible investment. The guidelines further aim to balance maximizing sustainable development outcomes while maintaining an attractive investment climate. 
The national investment policy guidelines targets policy action at three levels:

*''Strategic'' – policymakers should ground investment policy in a broad roadmap for economic growth and sustainable development, such as those set out in formal economic or industrial development strategies in many countries.
*''Normative'' – by setting rules and regulations on investment and in a range of other policy areas, policymakers can promote and regulate investment that is geared towards sustainable development goals.
*''Administrative'' – through appropriate implementation and institutional mechanisms, policymakers can ensure continued relevance and effectiveness of investment policies.

=== International Investment Agreements (IIAs):  Policy Options ===

The IPFSD aims to translate the Core Principles into concrete options for policymakers with a view to addressing today’s investment challenges by providing examples of how to draft IIAs that address sustainable development by strengthening development dimensions of IIAs, balancing the rights and obligations of States and investors, and managing the systematic complexity of the IIA regime. International investment policy must be addressed at three levels.

*''Strategic'' – this involves managing the interaction between IIAs and national policies, and those between IIAs and other international agreements e.g. human rights obligations.  The overall objective is to ensure coherence between IIAs and sustainable development goals.
*''Designing provisions for sustainable development''– this concerns addressing the policy space and balancing rights and obligations between States and investors, and effective investment promotion.
*''Building multilateral consensus on investment policy'' – this goes toward helping address the systemic challenges that emerge from overlaps and inconsistencies in the IIA regime.

The IPFSD suggests, clause-by-clause, how the IPFSD's Core Principles can be converted into concrete provisions in an IIA. Governments can choose from these explicit policy options those that best suit their countries’ levels of development and respective policy objectives.  Among others these include: adjustments of existing IIA provisions(e.g. making them more [[sustainable development]]-friendly through formulations that safeguard policy space and limit State liability); new provisions in IIAs (e.g. to balance investor rights and responsibilities and to promote responsible investment); and the introduction of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) (e.g. clauses for less-developed Parties to calibrate the level of obligations to the country’s level of development).

Some specific clause-level recommendations include:

*Narrowing the scope-and-definition clause to exclude portfolio, short-term or speculative investments from treaty coverage;
*Formulating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) clause as an exhaustive list of State obligations (e.g. not to (i) deny justice; (ii) treat investors in a manifestly arbitrary manner; (iii) flagrantly violate due process);
*Clarifying the distinction between legitimate regulatory activity and regulatory takings giving rise to compensation (i.e. indirect expropriations);
*Limiting the Full Protection and Security (FPS) clause to establish that "physical" security and protection will only commensurate with the country's level of development;
*Limiting the scope of the transfer-of-funds clause by providing an exhaustive list of covered payments/transfers, including exceptions triggered by serious balance-of-payment difficulties, and stipulating that the investor's transfer rights are contingent on its compliance with the host State's fiscal and other transfer-related obligations;
*Including exceptions to protect human rights, health, core labour standards and the environment, along with a check-and-balance system that ensures there is enough policy space while avoiding abuse; and
*Including clauses designed to eliminate or make investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) the last resort (e.g. after the investor's exhaustion of local remedies and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms).

== The New Generation of Investment Policies ==

The IPFSD embodies the new generation of investment policies that seeks to create a more intricate development strategy that maintains a favorable investment climate.  New generation investment policies seek to give investment policy a more prominent place in development strategies.  The continuous need to respond to newly emerging challenges and trends make it necessary to review and modify these guidelines.

== Dynamic Nature of IPFSD and The Investment Policy Hub ==

IPFSD has been designed with the intention of providing immediate technical assistance for the negotiation of investment agreements, while maintaining a dialog between investment policy stakeholders including the international development community, investors, business associations, labor unions, relevant NGOs and interest groups. The result of these ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations will be a dynamic document.

To that end, in concert with IPFSD, UNCTAD has provided a platform for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders—the [http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ Investment Policy Hub] which allows investment stakeholders to post comments regarding the content of the IPFSD. The combination then, of IPFSD and the Investment Policy Hub will enable IPFSD to remain a valuable resource for investment policy makers into the future.

[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel.jpg|thumb|160 px|Johann Albrecht Bengel]]
'''Johann Albrecht Bengel''' (24 June 1687 – 2 November 1752), also known as ''Bengelius'', was a [[Lutheran]] [[pietist]] [[clergyman]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek-language]] scholar known for his edition of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]] and his commentaries on it.

==Life and career==
Bengel was born at [[Winnenden]] in [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Major Bib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weborg|first=C. John|title=Dictionary of major biblical interpreters|year=2007|publisher=IVP Academic|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|isbn=978-0-8308-2927-9|edition=2nd|editor=McKim, Donald K.|page=184|chapter=Bengel, J(ohann) A(lbrecht)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the death of his father in 1693, he was educated by a family friend, David Wendel Spindler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9mG-EvdPYgC&amp;pg=PA2|title=A memoir of the life and writings of John Albert Bengel, prelate in Würtemberg|editor=John Christian Frederic Burk|location=London|publisher=R. Gladding, etc|year=1842|page=2|others=[[Robert Francis Walker]], trans}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a master in the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] at [[Stuttgart]]. In 1703 Bengel left Stuttgart and entered the [[University of Tübingen]] as a student at the ''[[Tübinger Stift]]'', where, in his spare time, he devoted himself especially to the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Spinoza]], and, in theology, to those of [[Philipp Jakob Spener|Philipp Spener]], [[Johann Arndt]] and [[August Francke]]. His knowledge of the [[metaphysics]] of Spinoza was such that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials for a treatise, ''De Spinosismo'', which was afterwards published.

After acquiring his degree, Bengel devoted himself to [[theology]]. Even at this time he had religious doubts; it is interesting in view of his later work that one cause of his perplexities was the difficulty of ascertaining the true reading of certain passages in the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. In 1707 Bengel entered the ministry and was appointed to the parochial charge of [[Metzingen]]-unter-Urach. In the following year he was recalled to Tübingen to undertake the office of ''Repetent'' (theological tutor).

He remained at Tübingen until 1713, when he was appointed head of a seminary recently established at [[Denkendorf, Baden-Württemberg|Denkendorf]] as a preparatory school of theology. Before entering into his new duties he travelled through the greater part of [[Germany]], studying the systems of education which were in use, and visiting the seminaries of the [[Jesuits]] as well as those of the Lutheran and [[Reformed church]]es. Among other places he went to [[Heidelberg]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], and had his attention directed at [[Heidelberg]] to the canons of scripture criticism published by [[Gerhard von Maastricht]], and at Halle to [[Campeius Vitringa]]'s ''Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin''. The influence exerted by these upon his theological studies is manifest in some of his works.

For 28 years, from 1713 to 1741, he was master ({{lang-de|Klosterpraeceptor}}) of the ''Klosterschule'' at Denkendorf, a seminary for candidates for the ministry established in a former monastery of the [[Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre|Canons of the Holy Sepulchre]]. To these years, the period of his greatest intellectual activity, belong many of his chief works.

In 1741 he was appointed prelate (i.e. general superintendent) at [[Herbrechtingen]], where he remained until 1749, when he was raised to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and prelate of [[Alpirsbach]], with a residence in [[Stuttgart]]. He devoted himself to the discharge of his duties as a member of the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]]. A question of considerable difficulty was at that time occupying the attention of the church courts: the manner in which those who separated themselves from the church were to be dealt with, and the amount of toleration which should be accorded to meetings held in private houses for the purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the duke of Württemberg was a [[Roman Catholic]]) was disposed to have recourse to measures of repression, while the members of the consistory, recognizing the good effects of such meetings, were inclined to concede considerable liberty. Bengel exerted himself on the side of the members of the consistory. In 1751 the [[University of Tübingen]] conferred upon him the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]]. He died in [[Stuttgart]], aged 65.

Bengel carried on an 18-year-long controversy with [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf]], leader of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] from [[Herrnhut]] in [[Saxony]]. This led to a break between the Moravian Brethren and the dour Pietism typical of Württemberg, represented by Bengel. With his determined certainty giving him systematic insight into the divine Plan of Salvation, Bengel dogmatically opposed the dynamic, ecumenical, missionary efforts of Zinzendorf, who was indifferent to all dogmatism and intolerance. As Bengel did not hesitate to manipulate historical calendars in his [[chiliasm|chiliastic]] attempts to predict the end of the world, Zinzendorf rejected this as superstitious  “interpretation of signs.”&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph translated from the [[:de:Johann Albrecht Bengel|corresponding article]] in [[:de:Hauptseite|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation as a Biblical scholar and critic rests chiefly on his edition of the Greek New Testament (1734) and his [[Exegesis|exegetical]] annotations on the same, which have passed through many editions in Latin, German, and English and are still highly valued by expositors of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Manson Myers, The Children of Pride, Yale University Press, 1972, p. 1461&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek New Testament==
[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel (timbre RFA).jpg|thumb|Stamp issued by the [[Deutsche Bundespost]] to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Bengel's birth]]
Bengel's edition of the Greek New Testament was published at Tübingen in 1734, and at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical apparatus. As early as 1725, in an addition to his edition of ''Chrysostoms De Sacerdotio'', he had given an account in his ''Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci recte cauteque adornandi'' of the principles on which his intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his work, Bengel was able to avail himself of the collations of upwards of twenty manuscripts, none of them, however, of great importance, twelve of which had been collated by himself. In constituting the text, he imposed upon himself the singular restriction of not inserting any variant reading which had not already been printed in some preceding edition of the Greek text. From this rule, however, he deviated in the case of the [[Apocalypse]], where, owing to the corrupt state of the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce certain readings on manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted a selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he denoted by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following manner: α was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the text; β, a reading better than that in the text; γ, one equal to the textual reading; and δ, readings inferior to those in the text. [[Robert Estienne]]'s division into verses was retained in the inner margin, but the text was divided into paragraphs.

The text was followed by a critical apparatus, the first part of which consisted of an introduction to the criticism of the [[New Testament]], in the thirty-fourth section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated canon, ''Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua'' (The difficult reading is to be preferred to that which is easy), the soundness of which, as a general principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics. The second part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration of the various readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating the evidence both against and in favor of a particular reading, thus placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment. Bengel was the first definitely to propound the theory of families or [[recension]]s of manuscripts.

His investigations had led him to see that a certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of the authorities for the Greek text manuscripts, versions, and ecclesiastical writers: for example, if a peculiar reading was found in one of these, it was generally also found in the other members of the same class; and this general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin for all the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although disposed at first to divide the various documents into three classes, he finally adopted a classification into two: the [[Africa]]n or older family of documents, and the Asiatic, or more recent class, to which he attached only a subordinate value. The theory was afterwards adopted by [[Johann Salomo Semler|J.S. Semler]] and [[Johann Jakob Griesbach|J.J. Griesbach]], and worked up into an elaborate system by the latter critic.

Bengel's labors on the text of the Greek Testament were received with great disfavour in many quarters. Like [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Brian Walton]] and [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] before him, he had to encounter the opposition of those who believed that the certainty of the word of God was endangered by the importance attached to the various readings. [[Johann Jakob Wetstein|JJ Wetstein]], on the other hand, accused him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his critical materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a ''Defence of the Greek Text of His New Testament'', which he prefixed to his ''Harmony of the Four Gospels'', published in 1736, and which contained an answer to the complaints, especially of Wetstein, which had been made against him.

The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation among scholars, and has been frequently reprinted. An enlarged edition of the critical apparatus was published by Philip David Burk in 1763.

==''Gnomon Novi Testamenti''==
The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation as an exegete is mainly based, is his ''Gnomon Novi Testamenti'', or ''Exegetical Annotations on the New Testament'', published in 1742. It was the fruit of twenty years labor, and exhibits with a brevity of expression, which, it has been said, condenses more matter into a line than can be extracted from pages of other writers, the results of his study. He modestly entitled his work a ''[[Gnomon]]'' or index, his object being rather to guide the reader to ascertain the meaning for himself, than to save him from the trouble of personal investigation. The principles of interpretation on which he proceeded were, to import nothing into Scripture, but to draw out of it everything that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical rules not to be hampered by dogmatical considerations; and not to be influenced by the symbolical books. Bengel's hope that the ''Gnomon'' would help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study of the New Testament was fully realized. It has passed through many editions, has been translated into [[German language|German]] and into [[English language|English]] (by [[Marvin Vincent]] in 1860), and is still valued by expositors of the New Testament. [[John Wesley]] made great use of it in compiling his ''Expository Notes upon the New Testament'' (1755).

Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor or author of many others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical and expository. The more important are: ''Ordo Temporum'', a treatise on the chronology of Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations regarding the end of the world, and an ''Exposition of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]]'' which enjoyed for a time great popularity in Germany, and was translated into several languages. His fame was such that almost 200 years later, [[Hermann Hesse]] has the hero of [[The Glass Bead Game]] discuss Bengel's writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4259">'''Jonathan Høegh von Leunbach''' ['lɔjnbɑk] (16 December 1884 - 24 September 1955)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/Jonathan-Hoegh-Leunbach/6000000018966190264&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] doctor.  During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">'''Kievan chant''', or chant in '''Kyivan style''' ({{lang-uk|Київський Розспів}}), is one of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] chants common to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] and those churches that have their roots in the Moscow Patriarchate, such as the [[Orthodox Church in America]].&lt;ref name="unmercenary" /&gt;

==History==

During the course of the 17th century, three new types of Orthodox liturgical chant appeared in the [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] region. The first of them was the Kievan chant, followed by the so-called “Bulgarian” or Bulgarski chant, and finally the “Greek” or Grecheski chant. They were collectively known by the term [[Obikhod]].&lt;ref name="unmercenary"&gt;Unmercenary Sacred Music: [http://www.unmercenary.com/chant/obchant.html Russian and Kievan Chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kievan chant first developed in the southwestern region of [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] (currently Eastern [[Ukraine]]) and then spread to [[Muscovite Russia]].&lt;ref name="motherofgod" /&gt; It was, in essence, a drastically simplified form of [[znamenny chant]].&lt;ref&gt;All Saints of Alaska Orthodox Church: [http://www.allsaintsofalaska.ca/index.php/the-orthodox-church/orthodox-music-chant Orthodox Music: Chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Kievan chant melodies tend to be shorter and simpler rhythmically than znamenny melodies; there are more pronounced distinctions between [[recitative]]-like and [[melisma]]tic passages; and certain phrases of text are repeated, something that generally does not occur in the [[znamenny chant]].&lt;ref name="motherofgod" /&gt;

The melodies of Kievan chant, for the most part, served as the basis for the so-called "Common" chant.&lt;ref name="motherofgod"&gt;Church "Mother of God": [http://churchmotherofgod.org/orthodox-terminology/glossary-k/886-kievan-chant.html Kievan chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5689">'''Lesbian Art Project''' (1977&amp;nbsp;– 1979) was a [[participatory art]] movement founded by [[Terry Wolverton]] and [[Arlene Raven]] at the [[Woman's Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project| pmid=20408013 | doi=10.1080/10894160903196541 | volume=14| issue=2| journal=J Lesbian Stud| pages=238–59 | last1 = Klein | first1 = J| year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering project focused on giving a platform to [[lesbian]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] perspectives of participants through [[performance]], [[Art|art making]], [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], [[Workshop|workshops]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref name="Journal of Lesbian studies"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project|author=Jennie Kelin|doi=10.1080/10894160903196541|pmid=20408013|volume=14|issue=2|journal=J Lesbian Stud|pages=238–59|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant piece of work created during the project was ''An Oral [[Herstory]] of Lesbianism'', in 1979, which documented lesbian women and their feelings, views, experiences, and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wack!

The Lesbian Art Project was part of an ongoing effort by [[Arlene Raven]], co-founder of the [[Woman's Building|LA Woman's Building]], to incorporate lesbian-oriented programming into the [[Woman's Building#Feminist Studio Workshop|Feminist Studio Workshop]], which had already launched the Los Angeles League for the Advancement of Lesbianism in the Arts (LALALA) in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787515|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTyBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq|editor=Bonnie Zimmerman|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and artists influenced by the tenets of [[postmodernism]] dismissed much of the art work made in the 1970s from a lesbian feminist perspective. This has resulted in very little being known or written about this pioneering work. The activities and events associated with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles have played a larger role in lesbian [[art history]] than is often acknowledged. The project began with six women (started by Terry Wolverton) working collectively with a common goal of increasing opportunity for lesbian artists and writing a chapter of lesbian art.  This small group disbanded in less than a year but Wolverton and Raven continued in their pursuit of a Lesbian Art Movement.  As they continued their project they became astonishingly productive, and they were able to integrate the Lesbian Art Project with the curriculum of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman’s Building.

At the Woman's Building they were able to organize a major performance event based on lesbian identities: ''The Oral Herstory of Lesbianism (Oral)''. Advertised as "Storytelling, Theater and Magic for Women Only",&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Norma, and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. "The power of feminist art: The American movement of the 1970s, history and impact." (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the project was directed by Wolverton and its stories generated through a workshop for the thirteen performers.

Along with the major performance event, a database for lesbian artists was now in existence. Wolverton and Raven went their separate ways before completing the book they had planned but both continued to individually promote feminist and lesbian art.     
  
A partial successor to the LAP was the 1980 [[Great American Lesbian Art Show]] (GALAS), also at the Woman's Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Identity Kit: The Great American Lesbian Art Show|last = Thompson|first = Margo Hobbs|date = 20 April 2010|journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume = 14|issue = 2–3|doi = 10.1080/10894160903196558|pmid = 20408014|pages=260–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Line of beauty''' is a term and a theory in [[art]] or [[aesthetics]] used to describe an S-shaped curved line (a [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] line) appearing within an object, as the boundary line of an object, or as a virtual boundary line formed by the composition of several objects. This theory originated with [[William Hogarth]] (18th-century English painter, satirist, and writer), and is an essential part of Hogarth's theory of aesthetics as described in his ''[[Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753). According to this theory, S-shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines, parallel lines, or right-angled intersecting lines, which signify stasis, death, or inanimate objects.

In contrast to grand compositional lines, which are regularly found in [[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] art, the serpentine line is not primarily dictating the whole composition of a canvas. Instead, the line should be understood as being found in parts; a composition is created by employing various kinds of lines in various relations to each other without destroying its simplicity.

'''Micro-sustainability''' focuses on the small [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al actions that collectively result in a large [[environmental impact]]. Micro-sustainability centers on individual efforts, [[behavior modification]] and creating attitudinal changes, which result in an environmentally conscious individual or community. Micro-sustainability encourages sustainable changes through "change agents", which are individuals that are encouraged; and therefore, foster positive environmental action inside their [[sphere of influence]]. Examples of micro-sustainability include [[recycling]], [[power saving]] by turning off unused lights, programming [[thermostat]]s for efficient [[energy use|use of energy]], reducing [[water usage]], changing [[driving habits]] or patterns in order to use less gasoline or modifying [[buying habits]] to reduce waste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. The focus is on individual actions, rather than organizational practices. These narrow, small ticket, community level actions have immediate local benefits. If widely imitated, they have a cumulative,&lt;ref name=transformative&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-how-personal-actions-can-kick-start-a-sustainability-revolution How personal actions can kick-start a sustainability revolution | Grist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; broader impact.

The remaining large-scale plans for [[sustainability]], categorized under the term ''macro-sustainability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jessestallone.com/2009/12/29/micro-vs-macro-sustainability/|title=Micro vs Macro Sustainability|date=2009-12-29|work=Jesse Stallone|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macro-economics of mineral and water resources.|last = Kisor|first = Kaulir|publisher = Capital Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = |location = India|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are in most cases addressed by governments, multi-national corporations or companies. They combat [[global issue]]s including [[climate change]], and reliance upon [[petroleum]]-based energy sources. Businesses primarily focus on the business case and return on investment of changes such as their source of energy or the way they transport or manufacture products. Governments confront these larger issues through increased regulation, subsidies, and investment in new technologies and energy sources.

[[ File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Giorgione's ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (c. 1510), Dresden, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].]]
In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

A '''phallus''' is a [[penis]] (especially when [[Erection|erect]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/phallus "Definition of phallus in English"] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; an object that resembles a penis, or a [[mimesis|mimetic]] image of an erect penis.

Any object that symbolically—or, more precisely, iconically—resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus; however, such objects are more often referred to as being '''phallic''' (as in "'''phallic symbol'''"). Such symbols often represent fertility and cultural implications that are associated with the male sexual organ, as well as the [[male orgasm]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|Tintinnabulum]] from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The term is a loanword from [[Latin]] ''phallus'', itself borrowed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φαλλός}}, which is ultimately a derivation from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] *''bʰel''- "to inflate, swell". Compare with [[Old Norse]] (and [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]]) ''boli'' "[[bull]]", [[Old English]] ''bulluc'' "[[Cattle|bullock]]", Greek {{lang|grc|φαλλή}} "[[whale]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=penis&amp;searchmode=none etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

The Hohle phallus, a 28,000-year-old siltstone phallus discovered in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave and reassembled in 2005, is among the oldest phallic representations known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Amos

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Bronze ithyphallic figurine with a head of phalluses.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Polyphallic wind chime from [[Pompeii]]; a bell hung from each phallus]]
[[File:0007MAN-Herma.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Herma|Herm]]]]
In traditional [[Greek mythology]], [[Hermes]], god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the ''messenger'' god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on [[herms]] (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god.  [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], son of [[Hermes]], was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus.

[[Priapus]] is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of [[Aphrodite]] and either [[Dionysus]] or [[Adonis]], according to different forms of the original myth, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia.  His name is the origin of the medical term [[priapism]].

The city of [[Tyrnavos]] in Greece holds an annual [[Phallic processions|Phallus festival]], a traditional phallophoric event on the first days of [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html "The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece"], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, Retrieved on the 15-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus was ubiquitous in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], particularly in the form of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a phallic charm. The ruins of [[Pompeii]] produced bronze wind chimes ''([[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]])'' that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the [[evil eye]] and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to [[Augustine of Hippo]], the cult of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity [[Mutunus Tutunus]] promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] has sometimes been characterized as "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallocentric]]".

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Osiris statuette cropped.jpg|thumb|Egyptian statuette of Osiris with phallus and [[amulet]]s]]
The phallus played a role in the cult of [[Osiris]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, [[Set (mythology)|Set]] scattered them all over Egypt and his wife [[Isis]] retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; see the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]. Isis made him a wooden replacement.

The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god [[Min (god)|Min]] was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis.

''Kuker'' is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]] performed by [[Kukeri]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"&gt;Kernbach, Victor (1989).

In [[Switzerland]], the heraldic bears in a coat of arms had to be painted with bright red [[penis]]es, otherwise they would have been mocked as being she-bears. In 1579, a calendar printed in [[St. Gallen]] omitted the genitals from the heraldic bear of [[Appenzell]], nearly leading to war between the two cantons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Neubecker | first1=Ottfried | title=Heraldry : sources, symbols, and meaning | date=1976 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | isbn=9780070463080 | page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Strehler | first1=Hermann | title=Das Churer Missale von 1589 | journal=Gutenberg-Jahrbuch | date=1965 | volume=40 | page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Grzimek | first1=Bernhard | title=Grzimek's Animal life encyclopedia | date=1972 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. | location=New York | volume=12 | page=119 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UgQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22&amp;dq=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
Figures of [[Kokopelli]] and [[Itzamna]] (as the Mayan tonsured maize god) in [[Pre-Columbian America]] often include phallic content. Additionally, over forty large monolithic sculptures (''Xkeptunich'') have been documented from Terminal Classic Maya sites with the majority of examples occurring in the Puuc region of Yucatán (Amrhein 2001). Uxmal has the largest collection with eleven sculptures now housed under a protective roof on site. The largest sculpture was recorded at Almuchil measuring more than 320&amp;nbsp;cm high with a diameter at the base of the shaft measuring 44&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Amrhein, Laura Marie (2001).

===Alternative sects===

[[St. Priapus Church]] (French: ''Église S. Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.

==Psychoanalysis==
[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]
The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire. 

In ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.

==Modern use of the phallus==
The phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is "[[Princess X]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W.

== History ==

=== Greek philosophy ===
The western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term ''[[techne]]'' (τέχνη) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of [[Western philosophy]]. A common theme in the Greek view of ''techne'' is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders). Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]] endorsed this view.&lt;ref name="Franssen et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franssen |first1=Maarten |last2=Lokhorst |first2=Gert-Jan |last3=van de Poel |first3=Ibo |title=Philosophy of Technology |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Spring 2010 |first4=Edward N., Ed. |last4=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/technology/ |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], [[Aristotle]] agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that ''techne'' can go beyond nature and complete "what nature cannot bring to a finish."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II.8, 199a15&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also argued that nature (''physis'') and ''techne'' are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause. While ''techne'' is shaped by an outside cause and an outside ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (goal or end) which shapes it.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II&lt;/ref&gt; Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while ''techne'' does not. In [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman ([[Demiurge]]) who created the world in accordance with [[platonic forms|eternal forms]] as an artisan makes things using blueprints. Moreover, Plato argues in the [[Laws]], that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.

=== Middle ages to 19th century ===
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Francis Bacon]]
During the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De Architectura]]'' (1st century BC) and [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]]'s ''[[De re metallica|De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). Medieval [[Scholastic philosophy]] generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature. During the Renaissance, [[Francis Bacon]] became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society. In his utopian work ''[[New Atlantis]]'' (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution ([[Salomon's House]]) uses [[natural philosophy]] and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions. The goal of this fictional foundation is "...the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== 19th century ===

The native German philosopher and geographer [[Ernst Kapp]], who was based in [[Texas]], published the fundamental book "Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik" in 1877.&lt;ref name="Kapp 1877"&gt;* [[Ernst Kapp]]: ''Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik. Zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Cultur aus neuen Gesichtspunkten'' (Braunschweig/Brunswick 1877, Reprint Düsseldorf 1978, Engl. Translation Chicago 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Kapp was deeply inspired by the philosophy of [[Hegel]] and regarded technique as a projection of human organs. In the European context, Kapp is referred to as the founder of the philosophy of technology.

Another, more materialistic position on technology which became very influential in the 20th-century philosophy of technology was centered on the ideas of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== 20th century to present ===

Five early prominent 20th-century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were [[John Dewey]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Günther Anders]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders,&lt;ref&gt;# The Outdatedness of Human Beings 1. On the Soul in the Era of the Second Industrial Revolution. 1956 # The Outdatedness of Human Beings 2. On the Destruction of Life in the Era of the Third Industrial Revolution.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Human Condition'', 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, ''[[Gestell]]'' or ''Enframing'' which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility. Heidegger's major work on technology is found in ''[[The Question Concerning Technology]]''.

Contemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Brian Holmes]],  [[Don Ihde]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla]], [[Carl Mitcham]], [[Leo Marx]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Paul Virilio]], [[Günter Ropohl]], [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[:pt:Álvaro Vieira Pinto|Álvaro Vieira Pinto]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

While a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, [[Paul Durbin]] has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v7n1/intro.html Techné Vol 7 No 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Those were ''Technology and the Good Life'' (2000), edited by [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], Andrew Light, and [[David Strong]] and ''American Philosophy of Technology'' (2001) by [[Hans Achterhuis]]. Several collected volumes with topics in philosophy of technology have come out over the past decade and the journals ''[[Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology|Techne: Research in Philosophy and Technology]]'' (the journal of the [[Society for Philosophy and Technology]], published by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]]) and ''Philosophy &amp; Technology'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]) publish exclusively works in philosophy of technology. Philosophers of technology reflect broadly and work in the area and include interest on diverse topics of geoengineering, internet data and privacy, our understandings of internet cats, technological function and epistemology of technology, computer ethics, biotechnology and its implications, transcendence in space, and technological ethics more broadly.

=== Technology and neutrality ===

[[Technological determinism]] is the idea that "features of technology [determines] its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from] technological change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the "development and deployment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of technologies. [[Lelia Green]] used recent gun massacres such as the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur Massacre]] and the [[Dunblane Massacre]] to selectively show technological determinism and [[social determinism]]. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed. It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">'''Quantitative storytelling''' ('''QST''') is a systematic approach to explore the multiplicity of frames potentially legitimate in a scientific study or controversy.&lt;ref name="QST1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012 |title=What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? |journal=Futures |volume=91 |pages=62–71 |year=2017 |last1=Saltelli |first1=Andrea |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014"&gt;[Giampietro, M., Aspinall, R. J., Ramos-Martin, J. and Bukkens, S. G. F. (2014) Resource Accounting for Sustainability Assessment: The Nexus between Energy, Food, Water and Land Use. Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge Explorations in Sustainability and Governance).](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb6uAwAAQBAJ)&lt;/ref&gt; QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice.  

==Context==
Quantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

In the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

Alternative frames (Ravetz, 1987&lt;ref name="Ravetz1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107554708700900104 |title=Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance |journal=Knowledge |volume=9 |pages=87–116 |year=2016 |last1=Ravetz |first1=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ; Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03085147.2011.637335 |title=Uncomfortable knowledge: The social construction of ignorance in science and environmental policy discourses |journal=Economy and Society |volume=41 |pages=107–25 |year=2012 |last1=Rayner |first1=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008&lt;ref name="Lakoff2008"&gt;[Lakoff, G., Dean, H. and Hazen, D. (2008) Don’t Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. Chelsea Green Publishing.](https://books.google.es/books?id=zbJ1oxHC9a0C)
&lt;/ref&gt;; Lakoff, 2010&lt;ref name="Lakoff2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17524030903529749 |title=Why it Matters How We Frame the Environment |journal=Environmental Communication |volume=4 |pages=70–81 |year=2010 |last1=Lakoff |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;

==Approach==
QST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the [[Post-normal science|PNS]] suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008&lt;ref name="Sluijs2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024008 |title=Exploring the quality of evidence for complex and contested policy decisions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Sluijs |first1=Jeroen P |last2=Petersen |first2=Arthur C |last3=Janssen |first3=Peter H M |last4=Risbey |first4=James S |last5=Ravetz |first5=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015&lt;ref name="Pereira2012"&gt;[Pereira, A. G. and Funtowicz, S. (2015) Science, Philosophy and Sustainability : the End of the Cartesian dream.{{pn|date=April 2018}}](https://www.crcpress.com/Science-Philosophy-and-Sustainability-The-End-of-the-Cartesian-dream/Pereira-Funtowicz/p/book/9781138796409)&lt;/ref&gt;).
QST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017)&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt; suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507163a |pmid=24627919 |title=Policy: The art of science advice to government |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7491 |pages=163–5 |year=2014 |last1=Gluckman |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006&lt;ref name="Boden2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767720600752619 |title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=223–36 |year=2006 |last1=Boden |first1=Rebecca |last2=Epstein |first2=Debbie }}&lt;/ref&gt;; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014&lt;ref name="Strassheim2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1332/174426514X13990433991320 |title=When does evidence-based policy turn into policy-based evidence? Configurations, contexts and mechanisms |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=259–77 |year=2014 |last1=Strassheim |first1=Holger |last2=Kettunen |first2=Pekka }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017&lt;ref name="Monbiot2017"&gt;[Monbiot G., 2017. Insectageddon: farming is more catastrophic than climate breakdown, The Guardian, October 20, 2017]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/insectageddon-farming-catastrophe-climate-breakdown-insect-populations)&lt;/ref&gt;) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.

QST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules [[sensitivity auditing]] by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;. 

QST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014" /&gt;): 

# feasibility (can we afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), 
# viability (can we afford it in the context of our internal constraints, governance, socioeconomic and technological arrangements?), and 
# desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?).

==Applications==
Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001&lt;ref name="Marris2001"&gt;[Marris, C. (2001) Final Report of the PABE research project funded by the Commission of European Communities.]( http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/docs/pabe_finalreport.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. 
By direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.

Other applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change,&lt;ref name="Saltelli-d’Hombres2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.12.003 |title=Sensitivity analysis didn't help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14520">'''Religious education''' is the term given to  [[education]] concerned with [[religion]]. It may refer to education provided by a [[Church body|church]] or religious organization, for instruction in [[doctrine]] and [[faith]], or for  education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or [[moral]] aims, e.g. in a [[school]] or [[college]]. The term is often known as [[religious studies]].

==England==
Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the [[public education|state education]] system in [[England]].  Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.

Religious Education in [[England]] is mandated by the [[Education Act 1944]] as amended by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] and the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]]. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.&lt;ref name="withdraw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|title=Religious Education&amp;nbsp;— collective worship and the right to withdraw|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193803/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|archivedate=2008-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year.&lt;ref name="collwors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|title=Collective worship|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=2005|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044304/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|archivedate=2008-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some "schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship" due to what they thought was "a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship" although Smalley noted that "there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed."&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4693129.stm|title=School worship: from sports to death|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=BBC|author=Lucy Wilkins|work=BBC News website | date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.&lt;ref name="nutbbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7311178.stm|title=Call to offer faith class choice|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|author=Hannah Goff|work=BBC News website | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England]] has a Local Agreed [[Syllabus]] which mandate subject teaching for each [[Key Stage]] and possibly for each school year. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page/@id=6004&amp;Subject/@id=7881|title=Religious Education: non-statutory framework|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|year=2004|author=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211211245/http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page%2F%40id=6004&amp;Subject%2F%40id=7881|archivedate=2007-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : ''éducation civique, juridique et sociale'', ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Israel==
Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/taulwps/fp/art44 A. Maoz, "Religious Education in Israel", 83  U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;679-728.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional [[Secularism|separation of state and religion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called {{nihongo|"Ethics"|{{ruby-ja|道徳|どうとく}}|doutoku|''lit.'' "morality"}} in [[primary school]], where the purpose is to teach [[moral values]] rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated [[secular]] stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.

==Lebanon==
Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by "ethics" classes.
Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Malaysia==
The Malaysian education system makes ''Moral Studies'' compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in ''Islamic Studies'' lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the "Moral" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019192539/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |archivedate=2008-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland ==
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] state schools, Religious Education is called ''Religious and Moral Education'' from ages 5 to 14, and ''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies'' from 14 to 18.

The majority of [[state school]]s in are [[Secular Education|non-denominational]], but as a result of the [[Education Act 1918]], separate denominational [[state school]]s were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are [[Roman Catholic]] but there are also a number of [[Scottish Episcopal]] schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and administered by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate]]. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]], which also appoints a [[chaplain]] to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.

==South Africa==
The [[South Africa]]n National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum. The policy does not apply to [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|publisher=info.gov.za|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131232848/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeenah|first=Na'eem|editor1-first=Brian|editor1-last=Ramadiro|editor2-first=Salim|editor2-last=Vally|title=Education Rights for Learners, Parents and Educators Book 5: Religion and Schools|url=http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|publisher=Education Rights Project|accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030181341/http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">The '''Royal Musical Association''' ('''RMA''') is a British [[learned society|scholarly society]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]]. Founded in 1874, the Association claims to be the second oldest musicological society in the world, after that of the Netherlands. Activities include organizing and sponsoring academic conferences in the UK, and making awards for outstanding scholarship, notably the annual [[Dent Medal]].

==History==
The society was founded by Sir [[John Stainer]] and was originally titled the Musical Association with a subtitle 'the investigation and discussion of subjects connected with the Art and Science of Music'. Sir [[Frederick Ouseley]], Stainer's teacher, was the first president. The Association was registered as a company in 1904 and as a charity in 1965. The Association was renamed the Royal Musical Association in 1944 following the orders of King [[George VI]].

==Publications==
The Association publishes the ''[[Journal of the Royal Musical Association]]'' ([http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=t794546064~tab=issueslist eJournal]). Before 1987 the ''Journal'' was known as the ''Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association'' (often abbreviated PMRA; {{ISSN|0080-4452}} and {{ISSN search link|1471-6933}}), and before 1945 as the ''Proceedings of the Musical Association'' (see {{OCLC|630055862}} for print holdings from 1878 to 1986). The RMA has also published a series of [[monograph]]s and the ''Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle'' that has generally come out yearly since 1961, published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrmc20 | title=Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]| accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''
*: ''t̵'' – ''ter-'', ''tem-'', ''ten-''
*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===
{{Main|Medieval Unicode Font Initiative}}
In the [[Unicode]] Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html v. 5.1] (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1DC0.pdf "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement"] (26 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf "Latin Extended Additional"] (10 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf "Supplemental Punctuation"] (15 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10190.pdf "Ancient Symbols"] (12 characters) and especially [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf "Latin Extended-D"] (89 characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/ |title= MUFI: Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in [[LaTeX]] or using [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211642 overstrike] in MS Word).

Characters are "the smallest components of written language that have semantic value" but glyphs are "the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/ |title= The Unicode Consortium |publisher= Unicode, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{portal|Sexuality}}
A '''Sexual Attitude Reassessment''', sometimes '''Sexual Attitude Restructuring''' ('''SAR'''), seminar is a process-oriented, structured group experience to promote participants' awareness of their attitudes and values related to sexuality, and to assist them in understanding how these attitudes and values affect them professionally and personally. Since the primary purpose of a SAR is the examination of attitudes and values, it is not a traditional academic experience designed to disseminate [[cognitive]] information, nor is it [[psychotherapy]] directed toward the resolution of personal problems.

A SAR provides an opportunity for participants to explore and understand their beliefs, attitudes, values and biases within the realm of sex and sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This self-exploration and self-understanding facilitates comfort that ultimately fosters improved communication skills, both on a professional and a personal level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

By becoming increasingly aware of their perceptions, beliefs, and feelings, participants become increasingly comfortable with the wide variation of existing sexual attitudes, behaviours, practices, and even sub-cultures.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Council of Representatives|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/amp-a0024659.pdf|website=APA|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comfort is necessary for sexual health professionals, and is also beneficial for individuals striving for personal growth and the development of healthy personal relationships.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

During a SAR, participants examine [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and sexual attitudes from numerous perspectives using a variety of images. The nature of a SAR requires that some of the media be explicit. The use of explicit media is necessary for increasing [[self-awareness]] and personal comfort with the many areas of sex and sexuality. In addition to the personal growth, the event involves small group discussions during which participants are challenged with the opportunity to practice their professional or [[interpersonal skills]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14724">'''Sexual capital''' or '''erotic capital''' is the social value an [[individual capital|individual]] or [[social group|group]] accrues, as a result of their [[sexual attractiveness]]. As with other forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], sexual capital is convertible, and may be useful in acquiring other forms of capital, including [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]].

== Origins ==
The term erotic capital was first used by British [[sociologist]] [[Catherine Hakim]] in the early 2000s. Hakim defined it as separate from and building upon French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s concepts of economic, cultural and social capital. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin and therefore enables social mobility, and argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Erotic Capital: The Power of Attraction in the Boardroom and the Bedroom|last = Hakim|first = Catherine|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0465027474|location = |pages = 16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manosphere, the parallel term ''sexual market value'' or its abbreviation ''SMV'' is often used.&lt;ref&gt;Boysen, Benjamin.

==Definition==

===Economic===
One economic-related definition is based on the human truth capital theory of [[Gary Becker]], and predicts that people invest rationally in exhibiting their sex appeal when they can expect a return on their investments. This he defines as a form of health capital which is itself a form of [[individual capital]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

Some of these attributes may be immutable, such as an individual's race or [[height]], while others may be acquired through fitness training, or artificially, through [[plastic surgery]] or a [[makeover]], etc.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt; There is no single [[hegemonic]] form of erotic (sexual) capital. On the contrary, currencies of capital are quite variable, acquiring a hegemonic status in relation to the erotic preferences of highly specialized social groups that distinguish one [[sexual field]] from another. Importantly, this means that erotic capital is best conceived as a property of the field, and not an individual form of capital.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;

A second definition is developed by Hakim, treating erotic capital as the fourth personal asset. This definition is a multifaceted combination of physical and social attractiveness that goes well beyond sexual attractiveness that is the focus of the 'fields' perspective. Unlike Green's conception of sexual capital, Hakim's erotic capital is an individual capital with no necessary referent to a field.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

Extensive supporting evidence for the concept of sexual capital, defined as beauty, physical attractiveness, and good looks, is provided in [[Daniel Hamermesh]]'s latest book, ''Beauty Pays'', where he reviews the research evidence on the economic benefits of being attractive in all contexts, including higher education teaching, politics, sales and marketing, and everyday social interaction. Hamermesh assumes these economic benefits must be due to unfair discrimination, a position he takes from [[Deborah Rhode]]'s new book, ''Beauty Bias'', a feminist lawyer's critique of the social benefits that accrue to attractive people, and the disadvantages experienced by unattractive people, most particularly the [[obese]].

==Importance==
Catherine Hakim argues that erotic capital matters beyond the sexual field, and beyond private relationships. Her research suggests that erotic capital is important in the fields of [[Mass media|media]], [[politics]], [[advertising]], [[sport]]s, [[the arts]], and in everyday [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], and consists of six elements:&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

# [[Physical attractiveness|Beauty]]
# [[Sexual attraction|Sexual attractiveness]]
# Social attractiveness
# Vivaciousness and energy
# Presentation
# [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]]

Catherine Hakim's theory of erotic capital argues that erotic capital is an important fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; that erotic capital is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and that erotic capital has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Hakim |title=Erotic capital |journal=[[European Sociological Review]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=499–518 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea that erotic capital / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular [[sexual field]] in which such characteristics are deemed desirable (For more, see Green, Adam Isaiah. 2013. "Erotic Capital and the Power of Desirability: Why 'Honey Money' is a Bad Collective Strategy for Remedying Gender Inequality". Sexualities 16:137-158).

Sexual capital may be related to both sexual and mental health, as when individuals with low sexual capital show diminished ability to talk about or negotiate condom use with a partner possessing greater erotic capital, and develop negative emotional states as a consequence of feeling unattractive.&lt;ref name = "Green"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi= 10.1177/002214650804900405 | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Health and Sexual Status in an Urban Gay Enclave: An Application of the Stress Process Model | journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior| publisher= American Sociological Association | volume= 49 | year= 2008 | pages=436–451 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broader theoretical terms, sexual capital is important for social theory insofar as it is one among other types of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], including [[social capital]], [[symbolic capital]], and [[cultural capital]] which influence the status accorded individual members of the larger society. Sexual capital is convertible to other forms of capital, as when actors parlay sexual capital into financial capital or social capital (e.g. [[Marilyn Monroe]]),&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt; or when attractive employees get raises and social connections from bringing in more customers by virtue of their looks.&lt;ref name="Prospect"&gt;{{cite journal

==Race==
Several studies suggest that sexual capital is closely associated with [[Race (human classification)|race]] or racial stereotypes of sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref name="SocialOppression"&gt;{{cite journal

Some studies show a more complex relationship between erotic capital and race. For example, some black men are afforded high sexual status because they appeal to the fantasies of some white gay men.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;
Susan Koshy argues that Asian women have gained sexual capital in the West through glamorous accounts of western male – Asian female sexual relationships in the media and arts.&lt;ref name="Sexual Naturalization" /&gt; James Farrer argues that white men living in China have enhanced sexual capital arising out of associations of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] with modernity, sexual openness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Alien Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

==Class and gender==
Scholars suggest that sexual capital is closely tied to [[social class]]. Groes-Green argues that sexual capital and other forms of bodily power become important resources among disenfranchised young men in Southern Africa when their access to [[economic capital]] and jobs is diminished. Groes-Green further argues that the emergence of sexual capital is linked to [[gender]] relations, e.g. when poor young men build sexual capital by grooming their looks and improving sexual performance in order to satisfy female partners and in competition with [[middle class]] peers and older so-called '[[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar-daddies]]'. Thus sexual capital reinforces [[masculinity]] in the face of male disempowerment, and it often develops as a response to conflict between [[hegemonic]] and subordinated masculinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groes-Green | first1 = Christian | year = 2009 | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol18num4/groes-green.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 286–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital portfolios==
Because desirability in a sexual field may depend on more than merely sexual attractiveness, Green (2014) develops the concept, capital portfolio, to capture the particular combination of capitals that make an individual or group more desirable than others.  Capital portfolios typically involve a combination of sexual capital with economic, cultural and social capitals. As an example, to the extent that women, on average, value financial resources (i.e., economic capital) in their male partners more than sexual capital, and men value sexual capital more than economic capital in their female partners, so one may conclude that heterosexual women and men seek out distinctive capital portfolios that include a different, gendered balance of capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|title=Sexual Fields: Toward a Sociology of Collective Sexual Life|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==
[[File:Lenin_attempt.jpg|300px|thumb|right|alt=Vladimir Pchelin painting about Lenin's assassination attempt, from 1927|[[Vladimir Pchelin]]'s artwork about Lenin's assassination attempt, 1927]]
[[File:Malevich142.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Kazimir Malevich abstract painting ''Mower'' from 1930|''Mower'' by [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], 1930]]
During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

Academics such as [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Lewis Mumford]] helped to define a sense of "community" and "commons" in their studies, forming the first part of a "spatial turn."&lt;ref name="scholarslab"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spatial.scholarslab.org/spatial-turn/what-is-the-spatial-turn/ | title=What is the Spatial Turn? | publisher=Scholars Lab - University of Virginia Library | accessdate=22 October 2014 | author=Guldi, Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turn developed more comprehensively in the later twentieth century in French academic theories, such as those of [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref name="scholarslab" /&gt; 

Technologies have also played an important role in "turns." The introduction of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) has also been instrumental in quantifying data in the humanities for study by its place.&lt;ref name="wm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://at.blogs.wm.edu/what-is-the-spatial-turn-a-beginners-look/ | title=What is the “Spatial Turn”?

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

==History==

The Mars Generation was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old [[Abigail Harrison]], popularly known as "Astronaut Abby" and has the support of high-level advisory board members which includes astronauts, engineers and scientists as well as [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[education]] and [[business]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/30544-astronaut-abby-launches-mars-generation.html|title=Launching 'The Mars Generation': Teen on Mission to Get People to Mars|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison started [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and space advocacy work at the age of 13 by initially setting up a [[Twitter]] account under her childhood nickname "Astronaut Abby."  She used her @AstronautAbby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstronautAbby|title=Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter account to connect with [[NASA]] employees to try and procure a quote for her National History Day project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her account biography stated that she was aspiring to be an astronaut and had a goal to be the first person to set foot on Mars. After she received the NASA quote, she began to share her journey to Mars which included tweets about space events, school and her personal life with the goal of not only exciting people about mars exploration but creating advocates for human space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, at 15-years old, Harrison partnered with her mentor, Astronaut [[Luca Parmitano]] as his [[Earth]] Liaison and shared his experience living in space on the [[International Space Station]] during [[Expedition 36]] and [[Expedition 37]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/101824/why-an-astronaut-asked-15-year-old-abby-to-help-get-the-word-out/#more-101824|title=Why An Astronaut Asked 15 Year Old Abby to Help Get The Word Out – Universe Today|date=2013-04-30|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harrison setup an international outreach program consisting of classroom web chats, an [[email]] [[pen pal]] program, [[classroom]] visits, blogging on AstronautAbby.com, writing for other publications, speaking at events, and sharing on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorecuriocity.org/Explore/ArticleId/2326/astronaut-abby-2326.aspx|title=CurioCity – CurioCité {{!}} Astronaut Abby|website=explorecuriocity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called the Soyuz Adventure, after Astronaut Parmitano returned to [[Earth]], it was renamed "The Future of Space" and Harrison continued to run the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/astronaut-abby-is-crowdfunding-her-way-to-outer-space/208184441/|title='Astronaut Abby' is crowdfunding her way to outer space|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://skepticlab.com/episode/029-mission-to-mars-with-astronaut-abby/|title=#029 – Mission to Mars with Astronaut Abby – SkepticLab|work=SkepticLab|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was the basis for the development of The Mars Generation nonprofit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sea.pcmag.com/news/9272/mars-and-the-public-imagination|title=Mars and the Public Imagination|date=2016-01-05|work=PCMag Asia|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8140">'''Visual literacy in education''' develops a student's [[visual literacy]] – their ability to comprehend, make meaning of, and communicate through visual means, usually in the form of [[image]]s or [[multimedia]].

==History==
Images have always been involved in learning with pictures and artwork to help define history or literary works. There is also a long tradition of using texts as educational images that reaches back to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|year=2014|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, visual literacy in education is becoming a much broader and extensive body of learning and comprehension. This is due to the integration of images and visual presentations in the curriculum as technology and the increasing availability of computers.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002&gt;Stokes, Suzanne. [http://ejite.isu.edu/Volume1No1/pdfs/stokes.pdf "Visual Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Literature Perspective."] ''[http://ejite.isu.edu/ Electronic Journal for the Integration of Technology in Education]'', [[Idaho State University]]. Volume 1, No. 1, Spring 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, in education in particular, the conventional approach was that young learners acquired conventions of print which made each student a discursive learner. As we have recognized that there are multiple learning
styles which better suit some students, some are text oriented, others are visual, kinesthetic, auditory, or a combination of two or more, developers of educational materials have adapted and made use of new media and technology. In 1989, there was a call for new curriculum in social studies, which was uniquely suited to bringing visual information to educational programs by introducing map reading skills, charts and graphs for analyzing data, primary source visuals from the period ephemera, and paintings, sculpture, architecture, objects of daily use, and other evidence of material culture that is the archive from which historians draw their information about past and present cultures. Materials that were embraced for their visual energy, authenticity, and characteristic interest to engage students were prepared by a research and development group named Ligature, whose design director, Josef Godlewski (July 3, 1948 – April 8, 2013), a teacher of graphic design at The Rhode Island School of Design, brought to what is now the accepted integration of visuals with text that we see in print and media board learning programs.

==Advancements of multimedia==
[[Multimedia]] advancements have redefined what it means to teach literacy in the classroom. Today, students must be able to present and decode written and visual images, presenting educators with the task of teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Students today are using [[PowerPoint]], [[PhotoStory]], [[MovieMaker]] and other tools to create presentations in the classroom. This presents a challenge to educators as they seek to empower their students with the necessary tools to thrive in a media driven environment.&lt;ref&gt;Riesland, Erin. [http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/riesland.htm "Visual Literacy and the Classroom."] ''NewHorizons.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators now understand that students lack the skills to accurately decipher and make ethical decisions based on that image. According to Susan Metros of the [[University of Southern California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/SusanEMetros/41090 Susan E. Metros biography], Associate Vice Provost/Deputy CIO/Professor, [[University of Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt; students find themselves able to view pictures, read a map and input data, but are unable to create an image, map data and understand why one chart is better than another. To better prepare students, school districts are taking it upon themselves to add a technology component to their [[curriculum]]. For example, instead of submitting papers, students can create short films or interactive essays. This promotes a hands-on approach to multimedia for students to learn new tools.&lt;ref&gt;Metros, Susan E. "[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ791201&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ791201 The Educator's Role in Preparing Visually Literate Learners]", ''Theory Into Practice'' 47.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching visual literacy==
Teaching [[visual literacy]] in the classroom means many things from film, dance, and mime through the use of diagrams, maps and graphs to children's picture books. Visual texts can be found in books, the internet, environmental signage, TV, tablet devices and touch-screen machines like ATMs. It includes teaching students to critically analyze the images presented to them through advertising and other media. It also entails equipping students with the tools to create presentations that effectively communicate content. Today teachers are using classroom [[blogs]] and [[wikis]] to keep their students up to date with class requirements and to encourage collaborative class discussions. More and more students are relying on technology to enhance their learning environments.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002/&gt; As technology continues to advance, their availability and capability  will create more tools for teachers to utilize.

An attempt to observe children reading and writing visual texts was made by twenty US and Australian teachers in 1990-94, and followed up in 2011. The results were published in Steve Moline, [http://www.k-8visual.info ''I See What You Mean; Visual literacy K-8''] (Stenhouse, 1995, [http://www.stenhouse.com rev. ed. 2011]). The visual texts studied were limited to those used in information books, e-books, and websites, such as diagrams, maps, storyboards, flowcharts, time lines, webs, trees and tables. Moline claims that the strategy he calls recomposing assists in essay planning and comprehension. Recomposing is described &lt;ref&gt;Steve Moline, ''I See What You Mean'', Stenhouse, 2nd ed., 2011, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; as reading information in a lexical format (such as a paragraph of sentences) and summarizing it in a visual format (such as a flowchart or table). The visual text then forms the framework for the child when writing her/his essay on the topic.

==Benefits==
Computers have become a major part of society. People must learn to communicate through images, as [[technology]] continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Burmark, Lynell (2002). "Visual Literacy: Learn to See, See to Learn." Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in higher education===
As technology advances, so too do the tools that teachers gain in teaching visual literacy skills to students. Scientific [[virtual model]]s and figures, [[digital mapping]], and other computer-based visual programs are all tools available as resources for higher education in schools. These tools can be used to "promote students' capabilities and skills" and create a new understanding of writing and learning in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Felten, Peter. [http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/November-December%202008/abstract-visual-literacy.html Visual Literacy]", ''[[Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning]]'', 40.6 (November/December 2008): 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Voyant Tools''' is an open-source, web-based application for performing text analysis. It supports scholarly reading and interpretation of texts or corpus, particularly by scholars in the [[digital humanities]], but also by students and the general public. It can be used to analyze online texts or ones uploaded by users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about|title=Voyant Tools Help|website=voyant-tools.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyant has a large, international user base: in October 2016 alone, Voyant's main server had 81,686 page views originating from 156 countries, invoking the tool 1,173,252 times.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hermeneuti.ca/VoyantFacts|title=Voyant Facts|last=Sinclair|first=Stéfan|last2=Rockwell|first2=Geoffrey|date=2016|website=Hermeneuti.ca: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities|publisher=Stéfan Sinclair &amp; Geoffrey Rockwell|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voyant "was conceived to enhance reading through lightweight text analytics such as word frequency lists, frequency distribution plots, and KWIC displays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Lauren F.|last2=Eisenstein|first2=Jacob|last3=Sun|first3=Iris|year=2015|title=Exploratory Thematic Analysis for Digitized Archival Collections|url=|journal=Digital Scholarship in the Humanities|volume=30|issue=Supp. 1|pages=i138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its interface is composed of panels which perform these varied analytical tasks. These panels can also be embedded in external web texts (e.g. a web article could include a Voyant panel that creates a word cloud from it). The book ''Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities'' demonstrates different approaches to text analysis using Voyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities.|last=Rockwell|first=Geoffrey|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stéfan|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=9780262332057|location=Cambridge|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Voyant Tools was developed by Stéfan Sinclair ([[McGill University|McGill]]) and Geoffrey Rockwell ([[University of Alberta]]) and continues to be updated. It developed out of earlier text analysis tools including HyperPo, [[Text Analysis Portal for Research|Taporware]], and TACT. Contributors have included Andrew MacDonald, Cyril Briquet, Lisa Goddard,and Mark Turcato.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Range of Uses ==
Researchers have used Voyant Tools to analyze texts in a wide range of contexts including literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rambsy|first=Kenton|year=2016|title=Text-Mining Short Fiction by Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright using Voyant Tools|url=|journal=CLA Journal|volume=59| issue =  3|pages=251–258|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; language teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlroy|first=Tara|year=2013|title=Exploring Poetry and Identity in a Language Learning Environment|url=|journal=Studies in Linguistics and Language Teaching|volume=24|pages=31–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Caro|first=W.|last2=Mitello|first2=L.|last3=Marucci|first3=A.R.|last4=Lancia|first4=L.|last5=Sansoni|first5=J.|year=2016|title=Textual Analysis and Data Mining: An Interpreting Research on Nursing|url=|journal=Studies In Health Technology And Informatics|volume=225|pages=948|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maramba|first=Inocencio Daniel|display-authors=etal|year=2015|title=Web-based textual analysis of free-text patient experience comments from a survey in primary care|url=|journal=JMIR Medical Informatics|volume=3| issue =  2|pages=e20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moullec|first=Marie-Lise|last2=Jankovic|first2=Marija|last3=Eckert|first3=Claudia|year=2016|title=Selecting system architecture: What a single industrial experiment can tell us about the traps to avoid when choosing selection criteria|url=|journal=System Architecture Design|volume=30|issue=3|pages=250–262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing approaches to studying the internet using web scraping, Black has noted that "the Voyant Tools project is an excellent source to learn about the kinds of data that humanists can extract from Internet sources because it already supports text extraction from webpages."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=Michael L.|year=2016|title=The World Wide Web as Complex Data Set: Expanding the Digital Humanities into the Twentieth Century and Beyond through Internet Research|url=|journal=[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]|volume= 10|issue=1|page=106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of international digital humanities projects are running Voyant on their own servers. These include the French [http://www.huma-num.fr/ Huma-Num] project, the Italian [http://www.ilc.cnr.it/ CNR ILC], and the German [https://de.dariah.eu/ DARIAH-DE] project.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
