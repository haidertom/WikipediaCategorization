The expedition could be specifically designed for exploring the flora, or this could have been a part of studying the [[natural history]] of the region. A naturalist or [[botany|botanist]] was charged with drawing and describing the flora, collecting specimens of unknown plants in a [[plant press]], and identifying potential economically important plants.&lt;ref&gt;Visible Empire: Botanical Expeditions and Visual Culture in the Hispanic Enlightenment, Daniela Bleichmar, University of Chicago Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On botanical expeditions funded by governments, the plants were often collected by the person in the field, but described and named by a government sponsored scientists at botanical gardens and universities.

'''Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling''' (BEOSP or '''BEOS''') is a technique by which a suspect's participation in a [[crime]] is detected by eliciting [[electrophysiological]] impulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rissman|first=Jesse|last2=Greely|first2=Henry T.|last3=Wagner|first3=Anthony D.|date=2010-05-25|year=|title=Detecting individual memories through the neural decoding of memory states and past experience|pmc=2906873|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=107|issue=21|pages=9849–9854|doi=10.1073/pnas.1001028107|issn=0027-8424|pmid=20457911|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a non-invasive, scientific technique with a great degree of sensitivity and a [[Neuropsychological|neuro-psychological]] method of interrogation which is sometimes also referred to as ‘[[brain fingerprinting]]’.

== History ==
The methodology was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan (C. R. Mukundan), a [[Neuroscientist]], former Professor &amp; Head of [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] at the [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences]] ([[Bangalore, India]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/48486571/Rose_The_Mind_Transparent_No_Endnote_FINAL_for_publication_in_Body_Society.pdf|title=The Mind Transparent? Reading the human brain.|last=|first=|date=|website=King's College London|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked as a Research Consultant to TIFAC-DFS Project on ‘Normative Data for Brain Electrical Activation Profiling’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.axxonet.com/pdfs/BEOS_Profile_of_Experiential_Knowledge.pdf|title=Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature Profile Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature Profile of Experiential Knowledge|last=|first=|date=|website=Axxonet - A Research Center recognised by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, India.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works are based on research that was also formerly pursued by other scientists at American universities including J. Peter Rosenfeld, [[Lawrence Farwell]] &amp; Emanuel Donchin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/world/asia/15iht-15brainscan.16148673.html|title=India's use of brain scans in courts dismays critics|last=Giridharadas|first=Anand|date=2008-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-12|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
The human brain receives millions of arrays of signals in different modalities, all through the waking periods. These signals are classified and stored in terms of their relationship perceived as function of experience and available knowledge base of an individual, as well as new relationship produced through sequential processing. The process of encoding is primarily when the individual is directly participating in an activity or experiencing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cubist.cs.washington.edu/Security/2008/11/19/security-review-brain-electrical-oscillation-signature-profiling-in-criminal-trials/|title=UW Computer Security Research and Course Blog » Security Review: Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling in Criminal Trials|website=cubist.cs.washington.edu|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered secondary, when the information is obtained from a secondary source viz. books, conversations, [[hearsay]] etc. in which there is no primary experiential component and the brain deals mainly with conceptual aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dfsl.maharashtra.gov.in/1121/Psychology|title=Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Maharashtra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary encoding is deep seated and has specific source memory in terms of time and space of occurrence of experience, as individual himself/herself has shared or participated in the experience/act/event at certain time in his/her life at a certain place.

It is found that when the brain of an individual is activated by a piece of information of an event in which he/she has taken part, the brain of the individual will respond differently from that of a person who has received the same information from secondary sources (non-experiential).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensic-centre.com/2013/07/26/brainwave-signature-profiling/|title=Brainwave Signature Profiling|last=Ashcroft|first=Keith|date=2013-07-26|website=Centre for Forensic Neuroscience|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEOSP is based on this principle, thereby intending to demonstrate that the suspect who have primary encoded information of those who have participated in the suspected events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/This-brain-test-maps-the-truth/articleshow/3257032.cms|title=This brain test maps the truth - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; will show responses indicating firsthand (personally acquired) knowledge of the event.

== Procedure ==
# Pretest interview with the suspecT IN BEOS

# The suspect is acquainted with BEOSP test procedure
# Informed consent is obtained
Ideally, no questions are to be asked while conducting the test; rather, the subject is simply provided with the probable events/scenarios in the aftermath of which, the results are analyzed to verify if the brain produces any experiential knowledge, which is essentially the recognition of events disclosed. This way, all fundamental rights are protected, as neither there are no questions that are being asked or any answers reciprocated.

== Applications ==
[[University of Pennsylvania]] conducted a research along with the [[Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital]] ([[Boston Massachusetts|Boston, Massachusetts]]), Children's Hospital Boston &amp; the University Hospital of Freiburg, [[Germany]] which determined that [[Gamma oscillations|Gamma Oscillations]] in the brain could help distinguish [[false memories]] from the real ones. Their analysis concluded that in the retrieval of truthful memories, as compared to false, human brain creates an extremely distinct pattern of gamma oscillations, indicating a recognition of context based information associated with a prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sederberg|first=Per B.|last2=Schulze-Bonhage|first2=Andreas|last3=Madsen|first3=Joseph R.|last4=Bromfield|first4=Edward B.|last5=Litt|first5=Brian|last6=Brandt|first6=Armin|last7=Kahana|first7=Michael J.|date=2007-11-01|year=|title=Gamma Oscillations Distinguish True From False Memories|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02003.x|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=18|issue=11|pages=927–932|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02003.x|issn=0956-7976|pmc=|pmid=17958703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">The ''' California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS)''' is a summer program for high school students in [[California]] for the purpose of preparing them for careers in mathematics and sciences. It is often abbreviated COSMOS, although COSMOS does not contain the correct letters to create an accurate abbreviation. The program is hosted on four different campuses of the [[University of California]], at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], [[University of California, Irvine|Irvine]], [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego]], and [[University of California, Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]].

==History==
COSMOS was established by the [[California State Legislature]] in the summer of 2000 to stimulate the interests of and provide opportunities for talented California high school students. The California State Summer School for Mathematics &amp; Science is modeled after the [[California State Summer School for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/main/about# |title=About CSSSA |access-date=2016-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222845/https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/main/about# |archive-date=2016-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first summer, 292 students enrolled in the program. Each COSMOS campus only holds 150 students, so selection is competitive.  It is a great experience in exploring the sciences and a good activity for college applications, especially the University of California application.  This program is designed for extremely gifted students who make amazing discoveries in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) areas.

They feed insects to their brood, and obtain the sugar for their flight-muscle energy mostly from secretions of the brood. During this time they can be attracted to traps baited with meat or fish. Near the end of summer, when brood rearing ceases and this sugar source is no longer available, yellow jackets become frantic for sugar, and can be baited with sugar-based baits. They are also much more likely to visit fall flowers for nectar, than they are earlier in the season.&lt;/ref&gt;

! Sting
| Kills bee;&lt;ref name=sting&gt;Since the barbed stinger evolved as a colony defense against [[vertebrate]]s, the invariable outcome of stinging a mammal or bird is that the stinger becomes lodged in the victim's skin and tears free from the honey bee's body, leading to her death within minutes. As such, there is rarely any evolutionary advantage for a bee to sting a mammal to defend itself as an individual; honey bees will generally only sting when the hive is directly threatened and honey bees found in the field or on a flower will rarely sting.&lt;/ref&gt; continues pumping.

'''Cryo-Electron Microscopy''' ('''Cryo-EM''') is an [[electron microscopy]] (EM) technique applied on samples cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures and embedded in an environment of vitreous water. An aqueous sample solution is applied to a grid-mesh and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. While development of the technique began in the 1970s, recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng Y, Grigorieff N, Penczek PA, Walz T | title = A primer to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 3 | pages = 438–449 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25910204 | pmc = 4409659 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[NMR spectroscopy]] for macromolecular structure determination without the need for crystallization.

In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to [[Jacques Dubochet]], [[Joachim Frank]], and [[Richard Henderson (biologist)|Richard Henderson]] "for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History of Cryogenic Electron Microscopy ==
In the 1960s, scientist were faced with the issue of structure determination methods using electron microscopy damaging the specimen due to high energy electron beams, so cryogenic electron microscopy was considered to overcome this issue as it was expected that low temperatures would reduce beam damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubochet J, Knapek E | title = Ups and downs in early electron cryo-microscopy | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = e2005550 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29672565 | pmc = 5929567 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | url = https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Erwin Knapek and Jacques Dubochet published commenting on beam damage at cryogenic temperatures sharing observations that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thin crystals mounted on carbon film were found to be from 30 to 300 times more beam-resistant at 4 K than at room temperature... Most of our results can be explained by assuming that cryoprotection in the region of 4 K is strongly dependent on the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knapek E, Dubochet J | title = Beam damage to organic material is considerably reduced in cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–61 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 7441748 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(80)90382-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, these results were not reproducible and amendments were published in the Nature international journal of science just 2 years later informing that the beam resistance was less significant than initially anticipated. The protection gained at 4 K was closer to “tenfold for standard samples of L-valine,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/299386c0.pdf|title=Cryo-transmission microscopy Fading hopes|last=Newmark|first=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=30 September 1982|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; than what was previously stated.

In 2017, three scientists, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a technique that would image biomolecules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressey D, Callaway E | title = Cryo-electron microscopy wins chemistry Nobel | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | issue = 7675 | pages = 167 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29022937 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.22738 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/cryo-electron-microscopy-wins-chemistry-nobel-1.22738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chemists realized that electron diffraction can be used to readily determine the structures of small molecules that form needle-like crystals, structures that would otherwise need to be determined from X-ray crystallography, by growing larger crystals of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gruene T, Wennmacher JT, Zaubitzer C, Holstein JJ, Heidler J, Fecteau-Lefebvre A, De Carlo S, Müller E, Goldie KN, Regeni I, Li T, Santiso-Quinones G, Steinfeld G, Handschin S, van Genderen E, van Bokhoven JA, Clever GH, Pantelic R | title = Rapid structure determination of microcrystalline molecular compounds using electron diffraction | journal = Angewandte Chemie | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30325568 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201811318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Cryptozoology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] and [[subculture]] that aims to prove the existence of entities from the [[folklore]] record, such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], or [[Mokele-mbembe]]. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].

Originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].

==Terminology, history, and approach==
As a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"&gt;Regal, Brian (2011) "Cryptozoology", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011). ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art''. 2nd edition. [[ABC-CLIO]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cryptozoology'' dates from cryptozoologist circles from 1959 or before&amp;nbsp;– Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term ''cryptozoology'' ('the study of hidden animals') to Sanderson.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTOZOOLOGY"&gt;Additionally, see discussion at "cryptozoology, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the Summer issue of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="Regal2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regal|first=B.|title=Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a7GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-11829-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wall "[It has been] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like 'monster'. My suggestion is 'cryptid', meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wall |first=J.E. |title=The ISC Newsletter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSfXAAAAMAAJ |date=Summer 1982 |publisher=International Society of Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=10 |quote=The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like "monster." My suggestion is "cryptid," meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word , describing those creatures which are (or may be) subjects of cryptozoological investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the noun ''cryptid'' as "an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist".&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTID"&gt;"cryptid, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While used by most cryptozoologists, the term ''cryptid'' is not used by academic zoologists.&lt;ref name="PAXTON-2011"&gt;Paxton, C.G.M.  (2011). "Putting the “ology” into cryptozoology." . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other "imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, "there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids".&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt; Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;

Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], "Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration." Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].&lt;ref name="LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305"&gt;Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013.

===Young Earth creationism===
A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of [[Young Earth creationism]], rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as "[[Young Earth creationism#Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs|living dinosaur]]s". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 66. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Jeb J. Card says that "Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution."&lt;ref name="CARD-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that "[p]eople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldn't. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but that's their mistaken notion of evolution."&lt;ref name="NAT-GEO-PROTHERO"&gt;Shea, Rachel Hartigan. 2013. "The Science Behind Bigfoot and Other Monsters".''[[National Geographic]]'', September 9, 2013.

==Reception and pseudoscience==
The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], a senior editor at the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as possible evidence that "in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth." "Cryptozoology," Gee says, "can come in from the cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |journal=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens | doi = 10.1038/news041025-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey A. (2000). ''The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice''. [[Benjamin Cummings]]. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0805345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roesch, Ben S; Moore, John L. (2002). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: Volume One''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 71-78. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}} "Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the field's poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church, Jill M. (2009). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[H. James Birx]]. ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology &amp; Culture, Volume 1''. [[SAGE Publications]]. pp. 251-252. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4164-8}} "Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack, Caleb W; Rousseau, Jacques. (2016). ''Unknown Animals and Cryptozoology''. In ''Critical Thinking, Science and Pseudoscience: Why We Can't Trust Our Brains.'' [[Springer Publishing]]. pp. 153-174. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9419-0}} "Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific."&lt;/ref&gt; The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Shermer | year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288 (5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="luumsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-440-23656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that "there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title 'cryptozoologist'."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"/&gt;

Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:

:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.&lt;ref name="CARD-23-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 23-32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card notes that "cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early "rage against critics of cryptozoology". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, "Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious "[[Indian burial grounds]]" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|"Amityville" hoax]] ...".&lt;ref name="CARD-24-25"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 24-25. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 foreword for ''The American Biology Teacher'', then [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] president [[Dan Ward (educator)|Dan Ward]] uses cryptozoology as an example of "technological pseudoscience" that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that "Cryptozoology … is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting."&lt;ref name="WARD-2011"&gt;Ward, Daniel. 2011. “From the President”. The American Biology Teacher 73.8 (2011): 440–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Brian Regal]] includes an entry for cryptozoology in his ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009). Regal says that "as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals".&lt;ref name="NAGEL-50"&gt;Nagel, Brian. 2009. ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'', p. 50. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 issue of ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', [[folkloristics|folklorist]] Véronique Campion-Vincent says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon."&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"&gt;Campion-Vincent, Véronique. 1992. “Appearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in France”. ''Folklore'' 103.2 (1992): 160–183.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campion-Vincent says that "four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances": "Forteans" ("compiler[s] of anomalies" such as via publications like the ''[[Fortean Times]]''), "occultists" (which she describes as related to "Forteans"), "folklorists", and "cryptozoologists". Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that "this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby".&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"/&gt;

In her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that "folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry" and describes cryptozoology as an example of "American narrative traditions" that "feature many monsters".&lt;ref name="WATTS-271"&gt;Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that "cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2006-190-206"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2006. "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds". ''Folklore'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (Aug., 2006), pp. 190-206. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as "contemporary monster hunters" that "keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging" and that "on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus (largely ignoring, for instance, evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record)."&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2013-439"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2013. "Monsters and the Twenty-First Century" as published in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. {{ISBN|9781472418012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mike Dash]], few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards "more elusive" creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name="luumsh"/&gt;

Paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1984) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with [[creationism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Humans are the most inventive, deceptive, and gullible of all animals. Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. … In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.&lt;ref name="SIMPSON-1984-1-16"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). "Mammals and Cryptozoology". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''. Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 30, 1984), pp. 1-19. [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paleontologist Donald Prothero (2007) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience, and categorizes it along with [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Ufology#As a pseudoscience|UFO abductions claims]] as aspects of American culture that are "clearly baloney".&lt;ref name="PROTHERO-2007"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R.]]. 2007. ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'', pp. 13-15. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780231511421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'' (2017), Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of [[Young Earth creationists]] and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are "passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning. As with the [[ghost hunting|ghost seekers]], cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-56-68"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 56-68. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Does God Play Dice: The New Mathematics of Chaos''''' is a non-fiction book about [[chaos theory]] written by British [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]. The book was initially published by [[Blackwell Publishing]] in 1989.

==Summary==
In this book, Stewart explains [[chaos theory]] to an audience presumably unfamiliar with it. As the book progresses the writing changes from simple explanations of chaos theory to in-depth, rigorous mathematical study. Stewart covers mathematical concepts such as [[differential equations]], [[resonance]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], and [[probability]]. The book is illustrated with diagrams and graphs of mathematical concepts and equations when applicable.

The back of the book, and a summary of its content, reads, "The science of chaos is forcing scientists to rethink Einstein's fundamental assumptions regarding the way the universe behaves. Chaos theory has already shown that simple systems, obeying precise laws, can nevertheless act in a random manner. Perhaps God plays dice within a cosmic game of complete law and order. Does God Play Dice? reveals a strange universe in which nothing may be as it seems. Familiar geometric shapes such as circles and ellipses give way to infinitely complex structures known as fractals, the fluttering of a butterfly's wings can change the weather, and the gravitational attraction of a creature in a distant galaxy can change the fate of the solar system."

The title of the book is a reference to a famous quote by [[Albert Einstein]].

'''''Far-fetched facts''''' is a book by German [[anthropologist]] [[Richard Rottenburg]] published in German as ''Weit hergeholte Fakten'' in 2002; the English translation was released in 2009. The book is an [[ethnography|ethnography-based]], though fictionalized, [[polyphonic]] account of a waterworks improvement project in Tanzania (called Ruritania in the books fictionalization). The book follows the different stages of the development project by looking closely at the interactions between a Northern development bank, experts of an international consulting firm and African project managers. It focuses thereby on technologies of inscription that enable the reconnaissance and [[operationalization]] of improvement measures to be taken, but also guide the overall interaction between the different stakeholders of the project. Showing these representational and managerial practices the book lays bare the necessary day-to-day production of objectivity and legitimacy in development projects, but also the intricacies and inconsistencies of daily translation processes, that often lead to the rather disappointing results of such development enterprises. Inspired by [[Organizational studies|organizational]] and [[science and technology studies]] “Far-fetched facts” provides an anthropological critique of the aid industry in Africa distinct from [[Postdevelopment theory|postdevelopment critique]].

'''Future Earth''' is a 10-year international research program which aims to build knowledge about the environmental and human aspects of [[Global change]], and to find solutions for [[sustainable development]]. It aims to increase the impact of scientific research on sustainable development.

Future Earth is an interdisciplinary research programme bringing together natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities, engineering and law, and focused on designing and producing research together with stakeholders from outside the scientific community.

==Mission and principles==

Future Earth's mission is to "build and connect global knowledge to intensify the impact of research and find new ways to accelerate sustainable development". Its vision is for "people to thrive in a sustainable and equitable world". To do this, Future Earth aims to mobilize the international community of global environmental science researchers to: 
* Inspire and create interdisciplinary science relevant to major global sustainability challenges
* Deliver products and services that society needs to meet these challenges
* Co-design and co-produce solutions-oriented science, knowledge and innovation for global sustainable development
* Build capacity among scholars world-wide

==History==

Future Earth was launched in June 2012, at the [[UN Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30277519&lt;/ref&gt;

A globally distributed consortium was appointed as the Secretariat of Future Earth in July 2014, with offices in Montreal (Canada), Stockholm (Sweden), Colorado (USA), Tokyo (Japan) and Paris (France).

[[Amy Luers]] is the Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureearth.org/news/future-earth-names-amy-luers-new-executive-director/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

Scientific research and synthesis in Future Earth is carried out by a number of international networks, known as ‘global research projects’, many of which were launched under the umbrella of the existing four global environmental change programmes, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]], the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme|International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n10/full/nclimate2395.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP) and the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP). Some further projects arose out of the [[Earth System Science Partnership|Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP)]]. A formal process for the affiliation of these projects into Future Earth began in 2014. The projects are:

The '''Guildhall Lectures''' were an annual series of talks on the theme of communication, organised by the [[British Association]].

The lectures, held in the [[London Guildhall]], were sponsored and broadcast by [[Granada Television]].  The first set of three lectures were held in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Vol. 5'', p.457&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued until at least 1984.  Broadly on the theme of "Communication in the Modern World", they concerned the [[arts]], [[science]]s, [[politics]] and [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Curran et al, ''Television Today and Tomorrow'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heterophenomenology''' ("[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] ''of another'', not oneself") is a term coined by [[Daniel Dennett]] to describe an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of [[consciousness]] and other mental phenomena. It consists of applying the [[scientific method]] with an [[anthropology|anthropological]] bent, combining the subject's self-reports with all other available evidence to determine their mental state. The goal is to discover how the subject sees the world him- or herself, without taking the accuracy of the [[subjectivity|subject's view]] for granted.

==Overview==
Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] phenomenology, which Dennett calls "lone-wolf autophenomenology" to emphasize the fact that traditional phenomenology accepts the subject's self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things ''seem'' to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|brackets]] it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence. 

The method requires a researcher to listen to the subjects and take what they say seriously, but to also look at everything else available to them, including the subject's bodily responses and environment, evidence provided by relevant neurological or psychological studies, the researcher's memories of their own experiences, and any other scientific data that might help to interpret what the subject has reported. 

Dennett notes this method is actually the normal way that anyone will choose to investigate aspects of the mind. He writes: "heterophenomenology is nothing new; it is nothing other than the method that has been used by psychophysicists, cognitive psychologists, clinical neuropsychologists, and just about everybody who has ever purported to study human consciousness in a serious, scientific way".{{sfn|Dennett|2003|p=22}}

The key role of heterophenomenology in Dennett's [[philosophy]] of consciousness is that it defines all that can or needs to be known about the mind. For any phenomenological question "why do I experience X", there is a corresponding heterophenomenological question "why does the subject say 'I experience X'". To quote Dennett, "The total set of details of heterophenomenology, plus all the data we can gather about concurrent events in the brains of subjects and in the surrounding environment, comprise the total data set for a theory of human consciousness. It leaves out no objective phenomena and no subjective phenomena of consciousness."{{sfn|Dennett|2003|p=20}}

An '''ignition tube''' is a piece of [[laboratory]] equipment.  It is a [[laboratory tube]] used much in the same way as a [[boiling tube]] except not being as large and thick-walled.  It is primarily used to hold small quantities of substances which are undergoing direct heating by a [[Bunsen burner]] or other heat source. 

Ignition tubes are used in the [[sodium fusion test]].

Ignition tubes are often difficult to clean due to the small bore. When used to heat substances strongly, some char may stick to the walls as well. They are usually disposable.

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

[[File:Benard cell.jpg|thumb|500px|Benard Cell]]
'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life. Frontiers in Bioscience (in press, pg 4-5). Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

If something seems to be obviously pseudoscience, then either such a source likely exists somewhere or it isn't notable enough to warrant inclusion.

The inclusion criteria must necessarily be strict enough that notability should
be established at the main article first, using RS. So ensure that the main article
first contains proper information documenting that the subject is labeled as pseudoscience before entering the item here.

UNSOURCED entries WILL BE REMOVED in order to keep this list clear of original research and possible NPOV violations.

This is a list of topics that have, at one point or another in their history, been characterized as [[pseudoscience]] by academics or researchers. Discussion about these topics is done on their main pages. These characterizations were made in the context of educating the public about questionable or potentially fraudulent or dangerous claims and practices—efforts to define the nature of [[science]], or humorous parodies of poor scientific reasoning.

Criticism of pseudoscience, generally by the [[scientific community]] or [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] organizations, involves critiques of the [[logic]]al, [[scientific method|methodological]], or [[rhetoric]]al bases of the topic in question.&lt;ref name="Pollak2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=Melissa |last=Pollak |date=13 January 2000 |publisher=National Science Foundation |title=Science and Engineering Indicators |location=Arlington, VA |chapter=Chapter 8: Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Public Understanding |chapter-url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind00/access/c8/c8s5.htm |ref=harv |editor1-first=Norman M. |editor1-last=Bradburn |editor2-first=Rolf |editor2-last=Lehming |editor3-first=Lynda |editor3-last=Carlson |editor4-first=Mary J. |editor4-last=Frase |displayeditors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204041009/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind00/access/c8/c8s5.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of the listed topics continue to be investigated scientifically, others were only subject to scientific research in the past, and today are considered refuted but resurrected in a pseudoscientific fashion. Other ideas presented here are entirely non-scientific, but have in one way or another impinged on scientific domains or practices.

Many adherents or practitioners of the topics listed here dispute their characterization as pseudoscience. Each section here summarizes the alleged pseudoscientific aspects of that topic.

=== Astronomy and space sciences ===
* '''[[2012 phenomenon|2012 millenarianism]]''' – a range of [[Eschatology|eschatological]] [[belief]]s that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the [[Maya civilization]] (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at [[Chichén Itzá]] in Mexico, and [[Tikal]] in Guatemala. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Stuart | title=The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012 | publisher=Harmony Books | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA 2012"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222054800/http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html 2012: Beginning of the End or Why the World Won't End?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Ancient astronauts]]''' – a concept based on the belief that intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]] visited Earth and made contact with humans in [[ancient history|antiquity]] and [[prehistoric]] times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies, and religions. A common claim is that [[deity|deities]] from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in origin, and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans. The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by academics, and has received no credible attention in [[peer review]]ed studies.&lt;ref&gt;Harrold; "Noah's Ark and Ancient Astronauts: Pseudoscientific Beliefs About the Past Among a Sample of College Students;" The Skeptical Inquirer; vol 11.1; 1986: 61; [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]]; 13 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*  '''[[Ancient astronauts#Zecharia Sitchin|Anunnaki from Nibiru (Sitchin)]]''' (''variant'') – [[Zecharia Sitchin]] proposed in his series ''The Earth Chronicles'', beginning with ''The 12th Planet'' (1976) revolves around Sitchin's unique interpretation of ancient [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Middle East]]ern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old [[Mesopotamia]] were actually astronauts from the planet "[[Nibiru (Sitchin)|Nibiru]]", which Sitchin claims the Sumerians believed to be a remote "12th planet" (counting the Sun, Moon, and Pluto as planets) associated with the god [[Marduk]].  According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit our sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.
:*  '''[[Ancient astronauts#Robert Temple|Ancient astronauts from the Sirius star-system (Temple)]]''' (''variant'') – [[Robert K. G. Temple]]'s proposal in his book ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'' (1976) argues that the [[Dogon people]] of northwestern [[Mali]] preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including supposed advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Sumer]].
* '''[[Astrology]]''' (see also [[astrology and science]]) – consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Several systems of divination are based on the [[Apparent retrograde motion#Apparent motion|relative positions and movement]] of various real and construed celestial bodies. [[Astrology#Scientific analysis and criticism|Scientific testing]] of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt; Where astrology has made [[falsifiable]] predictions, it has been falsified.&lt;ref name=Zarka /&gt;{{rp|424}}
* '''[[Creationist cosmologies]]''' are explanations of the origins and form of the [[universe]] in terms of the [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1), according to which the [[God]] of the Bible created the cosmos in eight creative acts over the six days of the "creation week".&lt;!-- {{sfn|Skeptic|2010}} --&gt;
* '''[[Dogon people#Dogon and Sirius|Dogon people and Sirius B]]''' – a series of claims that the Dogon tribe knew about the white dwarf companion of [[Sirius]] despite it being invisible to the naked eye (and knew about it for reasons other than being told about it by visiting Europeans).&lt;!-- {{sfn|Skeptic|2010}} --&gt;
* '''[[Cydonia (region of Mars)#"Face on Mars"|The Face on Mars]]''' is a rock formation in [[Cydonia Mensae]] on Mars asserted to be evidence of intelligent, native life on the planet. High-resolution images taken recently show it to appear less face-like. It features prominently in the works of [[Richard C. Hoagland]] and [[Tom Van Flandern]].
* '''[[Lunar effect]]''' – the belief that the full Moon influences human behavior.&lt;!--{{sfn|Laporte|2010}}--&gt;
* '''[[Flat Earth#Modern Flat-Earthers|Modern flat Earth beliefs]]''' propose that the earth is a flat, disc-shaped planet that accelerates upward, producing the illusion of [[gravity]]. Proposers of a flat Earth, such as the [[Flat Earth Society]], do not accept compelling evidence, such as photos of planet Earth from space.&lt;!--{{sfn|Laporte|2010}}--&gt;
* '''[[Geocentric model#Religious and contemporary adherence to geocentrism|Modern geocentrism]]''' – In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system) is a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded]] description of the universe with the Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all circled Earth. The geocentric model served as the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy.
* '''[[Moon landing conspiracy theories]]''' – claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six manned landings (1969–72) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s, that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, Moon rock samples, and even some key witnesses.
* '''[[Nibiru cataclysm]]''' – a prediction first made by [[contactee]] Nancy Lieder that a mythological planet [[Nibiru (Sitchin)|Nibiru]] would collide with Earth. After having adjusted her prediction many times, she later claimed the year of the occurrence to be 2012. In 2017, a conspiracy theorist known as [[David Meade (author)|David Meade]] claimed 2017 was the year Nibiru would hit.
* '''[[Vaimānika Shāstra]]''' – claim that airplanes were invented in [[ancient India]] during the [[Vedic period]]. A 1974 study by researchers at the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]] found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the ''Vaimānika Shāstra'' described were aerodynamically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating [[Newton's laws of motion]].
* '''[[Worlds in Collision]]''' – writer [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] proposed in his book ''Worlds in Collision'' that ancient texts and geographic evidence show mankind was witness to catastrophic interactions of other planets in our Solar system.

=== Earth sciences ===
* '''[[366 geometry]]''' or '''Megalithic geometry''' – posits the existence of an [[Earth]]-based [[geometry]] dating back to at least 3500 BC, and the possibility that such a system is still in use in modern [[Freemasonry]]. According to proponents, [[megalithic]] civilizations in Britain and Brittany had advanced knowledge of geometry, mathematics, and the size of the Earth. The [[megalithic yard]] is correlated to the polar circumference of Earth using a circle divided into 366 degrees.&lt;!--{{sfn|Angell|1978|pp=253–58}}--&gt;
* '''[[Bermuda Triangle|The Bermuda Triangle]]''' – a region of the Atlantic Ocean that lies between Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and (in its most popular version) Florida. Ship and aircraft disasters and disappearances perceived as frequent in this area have led to the circulation of stories of unusual natural phenomena, paranormal encounters, and interactions with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].
* '''[[Climate change denial]]''' –  involves denial, dismissal, unwarranted doubt or contrarian views which depart from the scientific consensus on [[climate change]], including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its impacts on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions.&lt;!--{{sfn|Isaak|2007}}--&gt;
* '''[[Flood geology]]''' – creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]].&lt;!--{{sfn|Isaak|2007}}---&gt;
* '''[[Hollow Earth]]''' – a proposal that Earth is either entirely hollow or consists of hollow sections beneath the crust. Certain folklore and conspiracy theories hold this idea and suggest the existence of subterranean life.

=== Energy ===
* '''[[Free energy suppression|Free energy]]''' – a class of [[perpetual motion]] that purports to create energy (violating the [[first law of thermodynamics]]) or extract useful work from equilibrium systems (violating the [[second law of thermodynamics]]).
:* '''[[Water-fueled car]]s''' – an instance of perpetual motion machines. Such devices are claimed to use water as fuel or produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input.
:* '''[[Gasoline pill]]''', which was claimed to turn water into gasoline.
:* '''[[Hongcheng Magic Liquid]]''' – a scam in China where Wang Hongcheng (Chinese: 王洪成; pinyin: Wáng Hóngchéng), a bus driver from Harbin with no scientific education, claimed in 1983 that he could turn regular water into a fuel as flammable as petrol by simply dissolving a few drops of his liquid in it.
* '''[[Brilliant Light Power|Hydrinos]]''' – a supposed state of the [[hydrogen atom]] that, according to its proponent, is of lower energy than [[ground state]] and has extremely high efficiency as a fuel.
*'''[[E-Cat]]''' – a claimed cold fusion reactor.
* '''[[Orgone]]''' – a pseudoscientific concept described as an [[energy (esotericism)|esoteric energy]] or hypothetical universal [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]], originally proposed in the 1930s.

=== Physics ===
* '''[[Autodynamics]]''' – a physics theory proposed in the 1940s that claims the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate Einstein's theories of special relativity and general relativity, and Maxwell's equations.
* '''[[Einstein–Cartan–Evans theory]]''' – a unified theory of physics proposed by Myron W. Evans which claims to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. The hypothesis was largely published in the journal Foundations of Physics Letters between 2003 and 2005; in 2008, the editor published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis.
* '''[[Electrogravitics]]''' – claimed to be an unconventional type of effect or anti-gravity propulsion created by an electric field's effect on a mass. The name was coined in the 1920s by Thomas Townsend Brown, who first described the effect and spent most of his life trying to develop it and sell it as a propulsion system.

== Applied sciences ==
=== Agriculture ===
&lt;!--{{sfn|ICSU|2005}} --&gt;
* '''[[Lysenkoism]]''', or '''Lysenko-Michurinism''' – was a political campaign against genetics and science-based agriculture conducted by Trofim Lysenko, his followers and Soviet authorities. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964. The pseudo-scientific ideas of Lysenkoism built on Lamarckian concepts of the heritability of acquired characteristics. Lysenko's theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the "gene"; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection.
* '''[[Biodynamic agriculture]]''' – method of [[organic farming]] that treats farms as unified and individual organisms.  Biodynamics uses a calendar which has been characterized as [[astrological]]. The substances and composts used by biodynamicists have been described as unconventional and [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]].  For example, field mice are countered by deploying ashes prepared from field mice skin when Venus is in the Scorpius constellation.

=== Architecture ===
* '''[[Feng shui]]''' – ancient Chinese system of mysticism and [[aesthetics]] based on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], [[geography]], and the putative flow of [[qi]]. Evidence for its effectiveness is based on anecdote, and there is a lack of a plausible method of action; this leads to conflicting advice from different practitioners of feng shui. Feng shui practitioners use this as evidence of variations or different schools; critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork."&lt;ref name=duke&gt;{{cite book

However, over the centuries it... has become distorted and degraded into a gross superstition."&lt;ref name=duke /&gt;&lt;!-- p=833 --&gt;
* '''[[Ley line]]s''' – proposed intentional alignment of ancient monuments and landscape features was later explained by random chance.  Additional [[New Age]] and feng shui concepts have been proposed building on the original concept, and pseudo-scientific claims about energy flowing through the lines have been made.
* '''[[Vastu shastra]]''' is the ancient Hindu system of architecture, which lays down a series of rules for building houses in relation to ambiance. Scientists like [[Jayant Narlikar]] write that it has no "logical connection" with the environment and notes that sometimes what has already been built is demolished and rebuilt to accommodate the rules. In another instance a minister ordered the demolition of a slum to change the entrance of his office, as per Vastu consultants who claimed that changing the entrance to an east-facing gate would solve his political problems.

=== Health and medicine ===
{{See also|List of diagnoses characterized as pseudoscience}}

Pseudoscientific medical practices are often known as [[quackery]]. In contrast, modern medicine is (or seeks to be) [[Evidence based medicine|evidence-based]].
* '''[[Acupuncture]]''' – use of fine needles to stimulate ''acupuncture points'' and balance the flow of ''qi''. There is no known [[anatomical]] or [[histological]] basis for the existence of ''acupuncture points'' or ''meridians''. Some acupuncturists regard them as functional rather than structural entities, useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients. [[Dry needling]] is the therapeutic insertion of fine needles without regard to [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) knowledge.  Acupuncture has been the subject of active [[scientific method|scientific]] research since the late 20th century, and its effects and application remain controversial among medical researchers and clinicians.  Because it is a procedure rather than a pill, the design of controlled studies is challenging, as with [[surgery|surgical]] and other procedures. Some scholarly reviews conclude that acupuncture's effects are mainly [[placebo effect|placebo]], and others find likelihood of efficacy for particular conditions.
** '''[[Acupressure]]''' – [[manual therapy|manual]] non-invasive stimulation of ''acupuncture points''.
** '''[[Acupuncture points]]''' or ''acupoints'' – collection of several hundred points on the body lying along ''meridians''. According to TCM, each corresponds to a particular organ or function.
* '''[[Adrenal fatigue]]''' or '''hypoadrenia''' is a pseudoscientific diagnosis described as a state in which the [[adrenal gland]]s are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of [[hormone]]s, primarily the [[glucocorticoid]] [[cortisol]], due to chronic stress or infections.&lt;ref name=2012Rev&gt;{{cite journal |author = Shah R, Greenberger PA |year = 2012 |title = Unproved and controversial methods and theories in allergy-immunology |journal = Allergy Asthma Proc. |volume = 33 Suppl 1 |issue = 3 |pages = S100–2 |doi = 10.2500/aap.2012.33.3562 |pmid = 22794702 }} Quote: "There is no scientific basis for the existence of this disorder and no conclusive method for diagnosis."&lt;/ref&gt; Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction such as [[adrenal insufficiency]] or [[Addison's disease]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; The term "adrenal fatigue", which was invented in 1998 by James Wilson, a [[chiropractic|chiropractor]],&lt;ref name="sbm"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/fatigued-by-a-fake-disease/ |title = Fatigued by a Fake Disease |work = [[Science-Based Medicine]] |date = 28 October 2010 |accessdate = 12 March 2015 |author = Gavura, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be applied to a collection of mostly [[Symptom#Types|nonspecific symptoms]].&lt;ref name=2012Rev/&gt;  There is no [[scientific evidence]] supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as a diagnosis by any scientific or medical community.&lt;ref name=2012Rev/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/adrenal-fatigue-is-it-real |title = Adrenal Fatigue: Is It Real? |work = WebMD |publisher = Metcalf, Eric |accessdate = 2014-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A systematic review found no evidence for the term adrenal fatigue, confirming the consensus among endocrinological societies that it is a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Cadegiani |first1 = Flavio A. |last2 = Kater |first2 = Claudio E. |title = Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review |journal = BMC Endocrine Disorders |date = 24 August 2016 |volume = 16 |issue = 1 |pages = 48 |doi = 10.1186/s12902-016-0128-4 |issn = 1472-6823 |pmid = 27557747 |pmc = 4997656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Alternative medicine|Alternative or fringe medicine]]''' is any practice claimed to have the healing effects of medicine that is proven not to work, has no scientific evidence showing that it works, or is solely harmful. Alternative medicine is not a part of medicine, or science-based healthcare systems. It consists of a wide variety of practices, products, and therapies—ranging from those that are biologically plausible but not well tested, to those with known harmful and toxic effects. Despite significant costs in testing alternative medicine, including $2.5 billion spent by the United States government, almost none have shown any effectiveness beyond that of false treatments (placebo). Perceived effects of alternative medicine are caused by the [[Placebo|placebo effect]], decreased effects of functional treatment (and thus also decreased side-effects), and regression toward the mean where spontaneous improvement is credited to alternative therapies.
* '''[[Anthroposophic medicine]]''', or '''anthroposophical medicine''' – is a form of alternative medicine. Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925) in conjunction with Ita Wegman (1876–1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on occult notions and draws on Steiner's spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including massage, exercise, counseling, and substances.  Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure. In certain European countries, people with cancer are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested mistletoe, but research has found no convincing evidence of clinical benefit. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination, and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease. Professor of complementary medicine [[Edzard Ernst]] and other critics have characterized anthroposophic medicine as having no basis in science,&lt;ref name=mckie/&gt; [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]],&lt;ref name=seop/&gt; and [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="thes-aberdeen"/&gt;
* '''[[Applied kinesiology]]''' ('''AK''') – is a technique in alternative medicine claimed to be able to diagnose illness or choose treatment by testing muscles for strength and weakness. According to their guidelines on allergy diagnostic testing, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stated there is "no evidence of diagnostic validity" of applied kinesiology, and another study has shown that as an evaluative method, AK "is no more useful than random guessing", and the American Cancer Society has said that "scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness".

* '''[[Bates method|Bates method for better eyesight]]''' – is an alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates, M.D. (1860–1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes, and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary. Bates self-published a book, [[s:Perfect Sight Without Glasses|Perfect Sight Without Glasses]], as well as a magazine, [[s:Better Eyesight Magazine|Better Eyesight Magazine]], (and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such "strain", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. In 1952, optometry professor [[Elwin Marg]] wrote of Bates, "Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists."&lt;ref name="Chou"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Review of Optometry |url = http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/therapeutics/c/17353/ |title = Exposing the Secrets of Fringe Eye Care |first = Brian |last = Chou |volume = 141 |number = 9 |date = 15 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to "flashes of clear vision" experienced by many who followed it.&lt;ref name=Marg&gt;{{cite journal |last = Marg |first = Elwin |title = Flashes of clear vision and negative accommodation with reference to the Bates Method of visual training |journal = American Journal of Optometry &amp; Archives of American Academy of Optometry |date = April 1952 |volume = 29 |issue = 4 |pages = 167–84 |doi = 10.1097/00006324-195204000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such occurrences have since been explained as a [[contact lens]]-like effect of moisture on the eye,&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles.&lt;ref name="Raz2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raz2004b" /&gt;
* '''[[Biological terrain assessment]]''' – a set of computerized tests used to measure the pH, resistivity, and redox of a person's urine, blood, and saliva, with the intention of recommending a customized program of health supplements and remedies (such as vitamins, homeopathic supplements, or herbal medicines) based on the results. Proponents suggest that BTA allows for a correction of biological imbalances before they become pathological, while opponents claim that the tests are imprecise and results in incorrect diagnoses.
* '''[[Biorhythms]]''' – is an attempt to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles. Most scientists believe that the idea has no more predictive power than chance and consider the concept an example of pseudoscience.  For the scientific study of biological cycles such as [[circadian rhythm]]s, see [[chronobiology]].
* '''[[Body memory]]''' – is a hypothesis that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. The idea could be pseudoscientific as there are no known means by which tissues other than the brain are capable of storing memories. Body memory is used to explain having memories for events where the brain was not in a position to store memories and is sometimes a catalyst for repressed memory recovery. These memories are often characterised with phantom pain in a part or parts of the body—the body appearing to remember the past trauma. The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of repressed memories, in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations. Other ideas of body memory can be the transfer of memories from one person to the next through organ donations, the organ carrying past memories to the new receiver of the organ. Another example of body memory is based on decapitated animals that upon regrowing their head seem to recall past memories and training. This may suggest evidence that such means may be available to simpler forms of life.
* '''[[Brain Gym]]''' – is an organization promoting a series of exercises claimed to improve academic performance. 26 Brain Gym activities are claimed to improve eye teaming (binocular vision), spatial and listening skills, hand–eye coordination, and whole-body flexibility, and by doing this manipulate the brain, improving learning and recall of information.  Numerous books have been written describing research and case studies in which use of the Brain Gym activities benefited specific populations, including children recovering from burn injuries and those diagnosed with autism. The Brain Gym activities have been incorporated into many educational, sports, business, and seniors programs throughout the world. They are also widely used in British state schools. The program has been criticised as pseudoscience for the lack of references in some of the theories used in the 1994 Brain Gym: Teacher's Edition (revised in 2010) and for the absence of peer-reviewed research that performing the activities has a direct effect on academic performance.
* '''[[Candida hypersensitivity]]''' – It has been spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[weight gain]], [[constipation]], [[dizziness]], muscle and joint [[pain]], [[asthma]], and others.&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies"|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|date=8 October 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203124/http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion has been strongly disabused by the [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]].&lt;ref name="AndersonChai1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=J|last2=Chai|first2=H|last3=Claman|first3=H|last4=Ellis|first4=E|last5=Fink|first5=J|last6=Kaplan|first6=A|last7=Lieberman|first7=P|last8=Pierson|first8=W|last9=Salvaggio|first9=J|last10=Sheffer|first10=A|title=Candidiasis hypersensitivity syndromeApproved by the executive committee of the American academy of allergy and immunology|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=78|issue=2|year=1986|pages=271–273|issn=0091-6749|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(86)80073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chiropractic]]''' is an [[alternative medicine]] practice focused on finding [[vertebral subluxation]]s and treating them with [[spinal adjustment]]s. Many modern chiropractors target solely mechanical dysfunction, and offer health and lifestyle counseling. Many others, however, base their practice on the [[vitalism]] of [[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]] and [[B. J. Palmer]], maintaining that all or many organic diseases are the result of hypothetical spinal dysfunctions known as ''[[vertebral subluxation]]s'' and the impaired flow of ''Innate intelligence'', a form of [[putative energy]]. These ideas are not based in science, and along with the lack of a strong research base are in part responsible for the historical conflict between chiropractic and mainstream medicine. Recent systematic reviews indicate the possibility of moderate effectiveness for spinal manipulation in the management of nonspecific [[lower back pain]]. The effectiveness of chiropractic spinal manipulation has not been demonstrated according to the principles of [[evidence-based medicine]] for any other condition. Adverse symptomatic events, which are all qualified as relatively mild in the referenced report, with possible neurologic involvement following spinal manipulation, particularly upper spinal manipulation, occur with a frequency of between 33% and 61%. Most events are minor, such as mild soreness, fainting, dizziness, light headedness, headache, or numbness or tingling in the upper limbs; serious complications such as [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], [[vertebral artery dissection]], or [[myelopathy]] are observed infrequently.
** '''[[Vertebral subluxation]]''' – a chiropractic term that describes variously a site of impaired flow of ''innate'' or a spinal lesion that is postulated to cause neuromusculoskeletal or visceral dysfunction. [[Scientific consensus]] does not support the existence of chiropractic's vertebral subluxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiropractic Vertebral Subluxations: Science vs. Pseudoscience|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractic-vertebral-subluxations-science-vs-pseudoscience/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=1 October 2010|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Sam|last=Homola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homola2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homola|first1=Samuel|title=Real orthopaedic subluxations versus imaginary chiropractic subluxations|journal=Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|volume=15|issue=4|year=2010|pages=284–287|issn=1465-3753|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2010.01053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chronic Lyme disease]]''' (not to be confused with [[Lyme disease]]) is a generally rejected diagnosis that encompasses "a broad array of illnesses or symptom complexes for which there is no reproducible or convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' infection."&lt;ref name="nejm-feder"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Critical Appraisal of "Chronic Lyme Disease" | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|NEJM]] | volume = 357 | issue = 14 | pages = 1422–30 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17914043 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072023 | last1 = Feder | first1 = HM | last2 = Johnson | first2 = BJB | last3 = O'Connell | first3 = S | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Shapiro | first4 = ED | last5 = Steere | first5 = AC | last6 = Wormser | first6 = GP | author7 = Ad Hoc International Lyme Disease Group | last8 = Agger | first8 = WA | last9 = Artsob | first9 = H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous studies, there is no clinical evidence that "chronic" Lyme disease is caused by a persistent infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=P.

* '''[[Colon cleansing]]''' (colonics, colon hydrotherapy) – encompasses several alternative medical therapies intended to remove fecal waste and unidentified [[Toxin#Non-technical usage|toxins]] from the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and intestinal tract. Practitioners believe that accumulations of putrefied [[feces]] line the walls of the [[large intestine]] and that they harbor [[parasite]]s or pathogenic [[gut flora]], causing [[nonspecific symptom]]s and general ill-health. This "auto-intoxication" hypothesis is based on medical beliefs of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and was discredited in the early 20th century.
* '''[[Craniosacral therapy]]''' – is a form of bodywork or alternative therapy using gentle touch to manipulate the synarthrodial joints of the cranium. A practitioner of cranial-sacral therapy may also apply light touches to a patient's spine and pelvis. Practitioners believe that this manipulation regulates the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and aids in "primary respiration." Craniosacral therapy was developed by John Upledger, D.O. in the 1970s, as an offshoot of osteopathy in the cranial field, or cranial osteopathy, which was developed in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease." CST has been characterized as pseudoscience and its practice has been called quackery. Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners' claims the paper examined.
* '''[[Crystal healing]]''' – belief that [[crystals]] have healing properties. Once common among pre-scientific and indigenous peoples, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s with the [[New Age]] movement.
* '''[[Cupping therapy]]''' – an ancient Chinese form of [[alternative medicine]] in which a local suction is created on the skin; practitioners believe this mobilizes blood flow in order to promote healing. Suction is created using heat (fire) or mechanical devices (hand or electrical pumps).  Only one controlled trial of cupping has been conducted, and it did not demonstrate any effectiveness for pain relief. A book by [[Simon Singh]] and Edzard Ernst claims that no evidence exists of any beneficial effects of cupping for any medical condition.
* '''[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|Detoxification]]''' – Detoxification in the context of [[alternative medicine]] consists of an approach that claims to rid the body of "toxins" – accumulated substances that allegedly exert undesirable effects on individual health in the short or long term.  Many mainstream media web sites offer articles on this practice, despite a lack of scientific evidence for either the presence of the toxins, harm from their presence, or efficacy of the removal techniques.
* '''[[Ear candling]]''' – an [[alternative medicine]] practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow [[candle]] and placing the other end in the [[ear canal]]. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective and does not help remove earwax or toxicants. The claim by one manufacturer that ear candles originated with the Hopi tribe is also false.
* '''[[Earthing therapy]]''' or Grounding – a therapy that is claimed to ease pain, provide a better night's sleep, and assist in diseases with symptoms of [[inflammation]] by being in direct physical contact with the ground or a device connected to [[Ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. Purportedly, the earth has an excess of electrons which people are missing due to insulating shoes and ground cover. Being in electrical contact with the earth provides the body with those excess electrons which then act as [[antioxidants]].
* '''[[Electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]''' (EHS) – reported sensitivity to [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s or [[electromagnetic radiation]] of various frequencies at exposure levels well below established safety standards. Symptoms are inconsistent, but can include headache, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and similar non-specific indications.&lt;ref name="RöösliMoser2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Röösli|first1=Martin|last2=Moser|first2=Mirjana|last3=Baldinini|first3=Yvonne|last4=Meier|first4=Martin|last5=Braun-Fahrländer|first5=Charlotte|title=Symptoms of ill health ascribed to electromagnetic field exposure – a questionnaire survey|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=207|issue=2|year=2004|pages=141–150|issn=1438-4639|doi=10.1078/1438-4639-00269|pmid=15031956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provocation studies find that the discomfort of sufferers is unrelated to hidden sources of radiation,&lt;ref name="rubinetal2005"/&gt; and "no scientific basis currently exists for a connection between EHS and exposure to [electromagnetic fields]."&lt;ref name="BadScience EMF woo"&gt;{{cite web

* '''[[Brainwashing]]''' or mind control – a theoretical indoctrination process which results in "an impairment of autonomy, an inability to think independently, and a disruption of beliefs and affiliations. In this context, brainwashing refers to the involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values". The term has been applied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which can be seen as subverting an individual's sense of control over their own thinking, behavior, emotions or decision making. In 1983, the American Psychological Association (APA) asked [[Margaret Singer]] to chair a taskforce called the [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control]] (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or "coercive persuasion" did indeed play a role in "cult" recruitment. The APA found that brainwashing theories were without empirical proof, and rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/molko_brief.htm CESNUR – APA Brief in the Molko Case]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}
* '''[[New Chronology (Fomenko)|Fomenko's chronology]]''' – argues that the conventional chronology is fundamentally flawed, that events attributed to antiquity such as the histories of Rome, Greece and Egypt actually occurred during the Middle Ages.
* '''[[Holocaust denial]]''' – The [[Leuchter report]] attempted to demonstrate on a forensic level that mass homicidal gassings at Nazi extermination camps did not take place.
* '''[[Phantom time hypothesis]]''' – proposes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, so that it placed them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire, thereby adding 297 years of "phantom time" to the Middle Ages.

== Numerology ==

|quote=Narconon, a subsidiary of Scientology, and the association "Yes to Life, No to Drugs" have also made a specialty of the fight against drugs and treating drug addicts. [...] Drug addicts are just one of the Scientologists' targets for recruitment. The offer of care and healing through techniques derived from dianetics is only a come-on. The detoxification of the patient by means of "dianetics purification" is more a matter of manipulation, through the general weakening that it causes; it is a way of brainwashing the subject. Frequently convicted for illegal practice of medicine, violence, fraud and slander, the Scientologists have more and more trouble getting people to accept their techniques as effective health measures, as they like to claim. They recommend their purification processes to eliminate X-rays and nuclear radiation, and to treat goiter and warts, hypertension and psoriasis, hemorrhoids and myopia... why would anyone find that hard to swallow? Scientology has built a library of several hundreds of volumes of writings exalting the effects of purification, and its disciples spew propaganda based on irresponsible medical writings by doctors who are more interested in the support provided by Scientology than in their patients' well-being. On the other hand, responsible scientific reviews have long since "eliminated" dianetics and purification from the lists of therapies – relegating them to the great bazaar of medical fraud. [...] Medical charlatans do not base their claims on scientific proof but, quite to the contrary, on peremptory assertions – the kind of assertions that they challenge when they come out of the mouths of those who defend "real" medicine.

  | quote      = The program, Narconon Drug Prevention &amp; Education, "often exemplifies the outdated, non-evidence-based and sometimes factually inaccurate approach, which has not served students well for decades," concluded Steve Heilig, director of health and education for the San Francisco Medical Society.  In his letter to Trish Bascom, director of health programs for the San Francisco Unified School District, Heilig said five independent experts in the field of drug abuse had helped him evaluate Narconon's curriculum.  [...] "One of our reviewers opined that 'this (curriculum) reads like a high school science paper pieced together from the Internet, and not very well at that,' " Heilig wrote Bascom. "Another wrote that 'my comments will be brief, as this proposal hardly merits detailed analysis.' Another stated, 'As a parent, I would not want my child to participate in this kind of 'education.' "  Heilig's team evaluated Narconon against a recent study by Rodney Skager, a professor emeritus at UCLA's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, describing what good anti-drug programs should offer students.  "We concurred that [...] the Narconon materials focus on some topics of lesser importance to the exclusion of best knowledge and practices," Heilig wrote, and that the curriculum contained "factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling."

'''Mandat International''', also known as the '''International Cooperation Foundation''', is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with consultative status to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the [[UNDPI]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

==Aims==
Mandat Internatioal aims to promote international dialogue and cooperation, including in the research domain. It promotes international law, data protection and sustainable development. It is strictly independent from any political or religious affiliation.

==Activities==
Mandat International is a foundation with public utility status, relying on a network of members covering the various fields of activity of international cooperation. It collaborates closely with most of the international organizations and is independent of any political or religious affiliation. Its first aim is is to promote international cooperation, including in the research domain. Its activities encompass various domains, from ICT research, to international law and privacy, multistakeholder dialogue and international research projects. Over time, the foundation has developed many projects, including several international research projects, international conferences and events, support to over 10’000 delegates for attending international conferences, educational programes, creating the Eduki foundation, legal search engines, conferences, etc. The foundation usually supports projects for a limited period of time but with the objective to have a sustainable impact. When its objectives are achieved it usually pioneers and addresses new emerging challenges.

The current focus of the foundation is on promoting international cooperation with the research community, developing international research projects, supporting technology transfer from the ressearch community to standardization and international organizations, and promoting international law. The foundation is also actively engaged in the Internet of Things domain to promote international cooperation and dissemination, in line with the International Declaration on Internet of Things for Sustainable Development adopted by the IoT Forum and the ITU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26323">'''Mechanical explanations of gravitation''' (or '''kinetic theories of gravitation''') are attempts to explain the action of [[gravity]] by aid of basic [[classical mechanics|mechanical]] processes, such as [[pressure]] forces caused by [[Impulse (physics)|pushes]], without the use of any [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the [[aether theories|aether]]. However, such models are no longer regarded as viable theories within the mainstream scientific community and [[general relativity]] is now the standard model to describe gravitation without the use of actions at a distance. Modern "[[quantum gravity]]" hypotheses also attempt to describe gravity by more fundamental processes such as particle fields, but they are not based on classical mechanics.

== Screening ==
{{main|Le Sage's theory of gravitation}}

This theory is probably&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1876), Peck (1903), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known mechanical explanation, and was developed for the first time by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] in 1690, and re-invented, among others, by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (1748), [[Lord Kelvin]] (1872), and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), and criticized by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1875), and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908).

The theory posits that the [[force]] of gravity is the result of tiny [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s or [[wave]]s moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the [[universe]]. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed [[pressure]] but no net directional force. With a second object B present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, so-to-speak—that is, from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise, B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are "shadowing" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces.
[[Image:Pushing5.png|center|frame|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P5: Permeability, attenuation and mass proportionality&lt;/div&gt;]]

This shadow obeys the inverse square law, because the imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the "shadow" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter.

''Criticism'': This theory was declined primarily for [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons because a shadow only appears in this model if the particles or waves are at least partly absorbed, which should lead to an enormous heating of the bodies. Also drag, ''i.e.'' the resistance of the particle streams in the direction of motion, is a great problem too. This problem can be solved by assuming superluminal speeds, but this solution largely increases the thermal problems and contradicts [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré (1908), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1875, Atom), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vortex ==
[[Image:Descartes Aetherwirbel.jpg|thumb|250px|Aether vortices around celestial bodies]]
Because of his philosophical beliefs, [[René Descartes]] proposed in 1644 that no empty [[space]] can exist and that space must consequently be filled with [[matter]]. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with [[vortex|vortices]]. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to [[centrifugal force]], matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater [[inertia]]—so due to the pressure of the condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed into the center of the vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Descartes, R.  | author-link =René Descartes| date= 1824–1826 | title=Les principes de la philosophie (1644)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/document?O=N094260 | editor=Cousin, V. | journal= Oeuvres de Descartes | volume =3  | place = Paris | publisher=F.-G. Levrault}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, 1644; Zehe, 1980, pp. 65–70; Van Lunteren, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=zehe&gt;Zehe (1980), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the basic premises of Descartes, [[Christiaan Huygens]] between 1669 and 1690 designed a much more exact vortex model. This model was the first theory of gravitation which was worked out mathematically. He assumed that the aether particles are moving in every direction, but were thrown back at the outer borders of the vortex and this causes (as in the case of Descartes) a greater concentration of fine matter at the outer borders. So also in his model the fine matter presses the rough matter into the center of the vortex. Huygens also found out that the centrifugal force is equal to the force, which acts in the direction of the center of the vortex ([[centripetal force]]). He also posited that bodies must consist mostly of empty space so that the aether can penetrate the bodies easily, which is necessary for mass proportionality. He further concluded that the aether moves much faster than the falling bodies. At this time, Newton developed his theory of gravitation which is based on attraction, and although Huygens agreed with the mathematical formalism, he said the model was insufficient due to the lack of a mechanical explanation of the force law. Newton's discovery that gravity obeys the [[inverse square law]] surprised Huygens and he tried to take this into account by assuming that the speed of the aether is smaller in greater distance.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Huygens, C.  | author-link =Christiaan Huygens| date= 1944 | title=Discours de la Cause de la Pesanteur (1690)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77870g/f451.table |editors=Société Hollaise des Sciences | journal=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens | volume =21  | place = Den Haag | pages =443–488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lunteren&gt;Van Lunteren (2002), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Newton objected to the theory because [[drag (physics)|drag]] must lead to noticeable deviations of the orbits which were not observed.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{Citation  | author=Newton, I.  | author-link =Isaac Newton | date= 1846 | title=Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy (1687) | url=https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich | publisher=Daniel Adee| place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that [[moon]]s often move in different directions, against the direction of the vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is [[Begging the question|circular]], because this means that the aether obeys  [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]]. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref name=newton /&gt;

== Streams ==
In a 1675 letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], and later to [[Robert Boyle]], Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, letters quoted in detail in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science by Edwin Arthur Burtt, Double day Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as [[Bernoulli's principle]] published in Daniel Bernoulli's book ''Hydrodynamica'' in 1738.

However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton's comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00258 Newton, 1692, 4th letter to Bentley&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Newton is also well known for the phrase [[Hypotheses non fingo]], written in 1713:&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to the testimony of some of his friends, such as [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] or [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]], Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence.&lt;ref name=lunteren /&gt;

Similar to Newton, but mathematically in greater detail, [[Bernhard Riemann]] assumed in 1853 that the gravitational aether is an [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally to the masses within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into the direction of the central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Riemann, B. | author-link =Bernhard Riemann| date= 1876 | title=Neue mathematische Prinzipien der Naturphilosophie | editor=Dedekind, R. |editor2=Weber, W. | journal= Bernhard Riemanns Werke und gesammelter Nachlass | place = Leipzig | pages =528–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to solve the energy problem was made by [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky]] in 1888. Based on his aether stream model, which was similar to that of Riemann, he argued that the absorbed aether might be converted into new matter, leading to a mass increase of the celestial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Yarkovsky, I. O.| author-link =Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky  | title = Hypothese cinetique de la Gravitation universelle et connexion avec la formation des elements chimiques | place= Moscow | date =1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': As in the case of Le Sage's theory, the disappearance of energy without explanation violates the [[energy conservation law]]. Also some drag must arise, and no process which leads to a creation of matter is known.

== Static pressure ==

Newton updated the second edition of ''Optics'' (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first explanation (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the [[lift (force)|lift]], a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether.

Like Newton, [[Leonhard Euler]] presupposed in 1760 that the gravitational aether loses density in accordance with the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass proportionality, matter consists mostly of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Euler, L.  | author-link =Leonhard Euler| date= 1776 | title=Briefe an eine deutsche Prinzessin, Nr. 50, 30. August 1760  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaMAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA173,M1 | pages=173–176 | place=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Both Newton and Euler gave no reason why the density of that static aether should change. Furthermore, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] pointed out that in this "hydrostatic" model "''the state of stress... which we must suppose to exist in the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel could support''".&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;Maxwell (1875, Attraction), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves ==

[[Robert Hooke]] speculated in 1671 that gravitation is the result of all bodies emitting waves in all directions through the aether. Other bodies, which interact with these waves, move in the direction of the source of the waves. Hooke saw an analogy to the fact that small objects on a disturbed surface of water move to the center of the disturbance.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;Taylor (1876), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory was worked out mathematically by [[James Challis]] from 1859 to 1876. He calculated that the case of attraction occurs if the wavelength is large in comparison with the distance between the gravitating bodies. If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Challis, J. | author-link =James Challis| date= 1869 | title=Notes of the Principles of Pure and Applied Calculation  | url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprinciple00chalrich | place = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Maxwell objected that this theory requires a steady production of waves, which must be accompanied by an infinite consumption of energy.&lt;ref name="maxwell 2"&gt;Maxwell (1875), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;
Challis himself admitted, that he hadn't reached a definite result due to the complexity of the processes.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

== Pulsation ==

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1871) and [[Carl Anton Bjerknes]] (1871) assumed that all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy to the fact that, if the pulsation of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they will attract each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is ''not'' in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of [[electric charge]]s. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[Woldemar Voigt]].&lt;ref name=zenneck&gt;Zenneck (1903), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'' : To explain universal gravitation, one is forced to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances.&lt;ref name=zenneck /&gt; And Maxwell argued that this process must be accompanied by a permanent new production and destruction of aether.&lt;ref name=maxwell /&gt;

== Other historical speculations ==

In 1690, [[Pierre Varignon]] assumed that all bodies are exposed to pushes by aether particles from all directions, and that there is some sort of limitation at a certain distance from the Earth's surface which cannot be passed by the particles. He assumed that if a body is closer to the Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Varignon, P. | author-link =Pierre Varignon| date= 1690 | title=Nouvelles conjectures sur la Pesanteur  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74179x | place = Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] assumed that the effect of the aether is proportional to the complete surface of the elementary components of which matter consists (similar to Huygens and Fatio before him). He also assumed an enormous penetrability of the bodies. However, no clear description was given by him as to how exactly the aether interacts with matter so that the law of gravitation arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Lomonosow, M. | author-link =Mikhail Lomonosov| date= 1970 | title=On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight (1758)  | url=https://archive.org/details/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp | editor= Henry M. Leicester | journal= Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | place = Cambridge | publisher=Harvard University Press | pages =224–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, [[John Herapath]] tried to apply his co-developed model of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases on gravitation. He assumed that the aether is heated by the bodies and loses density so that other bodies are pushed to these regions of lower density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Herapath, J. | author-link =John Herapath| date= 1821 | title=On the Causes, Laws and Phenomena of Heat, Gases, Gravitation  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCsAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA273 | journal= [[Annals of Philosophy]]  | volume =9  | place = Paris | pages =273–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown by Taylor that the decreased density due to [[thermal expansion]] is compensated for by the increased speed of the heated particles; therefore, no attraction arises.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

==Recent theorizing==
These mechanical explanations for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although such ideas continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the twentieth century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited. However, some researchers outside the scientific mainstream still try to work out some consequences of those theories.

A '''nadir line''' is a line traced on the ground directly beneath an [[aircraft]] while taking [[aerial photograph]]s of the ground from above. This line connects the [[image center]]s of the successive vertical [[photograph]]s. These photographs are generally taken with some degree of ''endlap''.  Can also represent a line traced by a shipping vessel.

'''Newton's laws of motion''' are three [[physical law]]s that, together, laid the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They describe the relationship between a body and the [[force]]s acting upon it, and its [[motion (physics)|motion]] in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,&lt;ref&gt;For explanations of Newton's laws of motion by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in the early 18th century, by the physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early 21st century, see:-

The three laws of motion were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton]] in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''), first published in 1687.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.&lt;ref name=Motte&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~gravitee/axioms.htm Andrew Motte translation of Newton's ''Principia'' (1687) ''Axioms or Laws of Motion'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], explained [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

A '''fourth law''' is often also described in the bibliography, which states that forces add up like vectors, that is, that forces obey the [[Superposition principle|principle of superposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiner|first1=Walter|title=Classical mechanics: point particles and relativity|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-21851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeidler|first1=E.|title=Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications IV: Applications to Mathematical Physics|date=1988|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4612-4566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wachter|first1=Armin|last2=Hoeber|first2=Henning|title=Compendium of theoretical physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-387-25799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|150px|Isaac Newton (1643–1727), the physicist who formulated the laws]]
Newton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses,&lt;ref&gt;''[...]while Newton had used the word 'body' vaguely and in at least three different meanings, Euler realized that the statements of Newton are generally correct only when applied to masses concentrated at isolated points;''{{Cite book| last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford A.| last2 = Becchi| first2 = Antonio| last3 = Benvenuto| first3 = Edoardo| title = Essays on the history of mechanics: in memory of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell and Edoardo Benvenuto| publisher = Birkhäuser| date = 2003| location = New York| page = 207| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6LO_U6T-HvsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essays+in+the+History&amp;cd=9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22isolated%20points%22| isbn = 3-7643-1476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily. This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis, or the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] and rotation of the body are of no importance. In this way, even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.

In their original form, Newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of [[rigid bodies]] and [[deformable bodies]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called [[Euler's laws of motion]], later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. Euler's laws can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubliner |first=Jacob |title=Plasticity Theory (Revised Edition) |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2008 |url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |isbn=0-486-46290-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331022415/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of [[frames of reference]] called [[Inertial reference frame|Newtonian or inertial reference frames]]. Some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view, the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame, and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second. Other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.&lt;ref name=tseitlin&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/j42866672t863506/ |title= Newton's First Law: Text, Translations, Interpretations and Physics Education |journal= Science &amp; Education | author= Galili, I. | author2= Tseitlin, M. |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |year= 2003 |pages= 45–73 |doi= 10.1023/A:1022632600805 |bibcode = 2003Sc&amp;Ed..12...45G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/1np/ch04/ch04.html |title= Newtonian Physics |author= Benjamin Crowell |chapter= 4.

In the given interpretation [[mass]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and (most importantly) [[force]] are assumed to be externally defined quantities. This is the most common, but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities.

Newtonian mechanics has been superseded by [[special relativity]], but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;In making a modern adjustment of the second law for (some of) the effects of relativity, ''m'' would be treated as the [[relativistic mass]], producing the relativistic expression for momentum, and the third law might be modified if possible to allow for the finite signal propagation speed between distant interacting particles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
===Newton's first law===
{{Main|Inertia}}

The first law states that if the [[net force]] (the [[vector sum]] of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the [[velocity]] of the object is constant. Velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity which expresses both the object's [[speed]] and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.

The first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum \mathbf{F} = 0\; \Leftrightarrow\; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v} }{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently,
* An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.
* An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless a force acts upon it.

This is known as ''uniform motion''. An object ''continues'' to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continuously move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.

Newton placed the first law of motion to establish [[frames of reference]] for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one [[frame of reference]] called a Newtonian or [[inertial reference frame]], relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.&lt;ref name=tseitlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA6,M1 |title=Special relativity |page=6 |author=NMJ Woodhouse |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |location=London/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's first law is often referred to as the ''[[Inertia|law of inertia]]''. Thus, a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net [[force]] acting on it is zero. In this sense, the first law can be restated as:

{{quote|''In every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame Φ is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in Φ. That is, a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame Φ continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beatty, Millard F.|date=2006|title=Principles of engineering mechanics Volume 2 of Principles of Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics-The Analysis of Motion, |page=24| publisher =Springer|isbn=0-387-23704-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wr2QOBqOBakC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Newton's first and second laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame. Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. [[Galilean invariance]] or the [[principle of relativity|principle of Newtonian relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thornton, Marion|date=2004|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|page=53| publisher = Brooks/Cole| edition=5th|

===Newton's second law=== &lt;!-- [Newton's second law] --&gt;

The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(m\mathbf v)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration. Since Newton's second law is valid only for constant-mass systems,&lt;ref name="plastino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plastino|first=Angel R. |author2=Muzzio, Juan C.|year=1992|title=On the use and abuse of Newton's second law for variable mass problems|journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|volume= 53|issue= 3|pages=227–232|issn=0923-2958|bibcode=1992CeMDA..53..227P|doi=10.1007/BF00052611}} "We may conclude emphasizing that Newton's second law is valid for constant mass only.

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force applied, ''m'' is the mass of the body, and '''a''' is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration. In other words, if a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it. An application of this notation is the derivation of [[G Subscript C]].

Consistent with the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|first law]], the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with [[uniform circular motion]]. The relationship also implies the [[conservation of momentum]]: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.

Any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see [[#Variable-mass_systems|below]]).

Newton's second law is an approximation that is increasingly worse at high speeds because of [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects.

====Impulse====
An [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] '''J''' occurs when a force '''F''' acts over an interval of time Δ''t'', and it is given by&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, J, Hillier, M J, ''Applied Mechanics'', p221, Pitman Paperbacks, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Serway&gt;{{cite book |title=College Physics |page=161 |author=Raymond A.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \int_{\Delta t} \mathbf F \,\mathrm{d}t .&lt;/math&gt;
Since force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \Delta\mathbf{p} = m\Delta\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
This relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book |title=The investigation of difficult things: essays on Newton and the history of the exact sciences in honour of D.T.

====Variable-mass systems====
{{main|Variable-mass system}}
Variable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases, are not [[closed system|closed]] and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt; that is, the following formula is wrong:&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;
&lt;!-- If you have the Halliday book, please add the missing fields of the Cite book template. While you're at it, update the same citation found in [[Force]].--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big[m(t)\mathbf{v}(t)\big] = m(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{v}(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}. \qquad \mathrm{(wrong)}&lt;/math&gt;
The falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect [[Galilean invariance]]: a variable-mass object with '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= 0 in one frame will be seen to have '''F'''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 in another frame.&lt;ref name="plastino" /&gt;
The correct equation of motion for a body whose mass ''m'' varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is&lt;ref name="plastino"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F + \mathbf{u} \frac{\mathrm{d} m}{\mathrm{d}t} = m {\mathrm{d} \mathbf v \over \mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].
Under some conventions, the quantity '''u'''&amp;thinsp;d''m''/d''t'' on the left-hand side, which represents the [[advection]] of [[momentum]], is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity '''F'''. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation becomes '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= ''m'''''a'''.

===Newton's third law===
[[File:Skaters showing newtons third law.svg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of Newton's third law in which two skaters push against each other. The first skater on the left exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; on the second skater directed towards the right, and the second skater exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; on the first skater directed towards the left. &lt;br/&gt;The magnitudes of both forces are equal, but they have opposite directions, as dictated by Newton's third law.]]

The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object ''A'' exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on a second object ''B'', then ''B'' simultaneously exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="resnick83"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resnick|last2=Halliday|last3=Krane|title=Physics, Volume 1|edition=4th|page=83|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third law means that all forces are ''[[interaction]]s'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body ''A''; the force exerted by Body ''A'' on Body ''B'' is called the "action", and the force exerted by Body ''B'' on Body ''A'' is called the "reaction". This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the "action" and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; the "reaction". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the "action" and the other as the "reaction". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the ''action'' and which is called ''reaction''; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.&lt;ref name="resnick83" /&gt;

The two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).

From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Newtons laws in latin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's First and Second laws, in Latin, from the original 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'']]
===Newton's 1st Law===
From the original [[Latin]] of Newton's ''Principia'':
{{Cquote|''Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:
{{Cquote|Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''The Principia'', A new translation by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman, University of California press, Berkeley 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. [[Galileo Galilei]], however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the ''absence'' of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what [[Johannes Kepler]] had called ''inertia''.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"—no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.

The law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'': {{quote|style=margin-top: -0.5em; padding-left: 0.5em;|That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.&lt;ref name="cohen117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

===Newton's 2nd Law===
Newton's original Latin reads:
{{Cquote|''Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur''.}}

This was translated quite closely in Motte's 1729 translation as:

{{Cquote|Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.}}

According to modern ideas of how Newton was using his terminology,&lt;ref&gt;According to Maxwell in ''Matter and Motion'', Newton meant by ''motion'' "''the quantity of matter moved as well as the rate at which it travels" and by ''impressed force'' he meant "the time during which the force acts as well as the intensity of the force''". See Harman and Shapiro, cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:
''{{quote|The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.}}''
This may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the [[Wren Library]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.

Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:
''{{quote|If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.}}''

The sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example (1) I Bernard Cohen, "Newton's Second Law and the Concept of Force in the Principia", in "The Annus Mirabilis of Sir Isaac Newton 1666–1966" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1967), pages 143–185; (2) Stuart Pierson, "'Corpore cadente. . .': Historians Discuss Newton’s Second Law", Perspectives on Science, 1 (1993), pages 627–658; and (3) Bruce Pourciau, "Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.60 (2006), pages 157–207; also an online discussion by G E Smith, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/index.html#NewLawMot 5. Newton's Laws of Motion], s.5 of "Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''" in (online) ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's 3rd Law===
{{Cquote|''Lex III: Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:

{{Cquote|Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.}}
Newton's [[Scholium]] (explanatory comment) to this law:
{{quote|Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&lt;ref&gt;This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the ''[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]'' on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425035710/https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |date=25 April 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above, as usual, ''motion'' is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.

Newton used the third law to derive the law of [[momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]];&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Corollary III to the laws of motion&lt;/ref&gt; from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via [[Noether's theorem]] from [[Galilean invariance]]), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when [[force field (physics)|force fields]] as well as particles carry momentum, and in [[quantum mechanics]]. &lt;!-- In force fields I do not think the violation is a necessity; we could easily remodel the fields perhaps as interaction between particles at the quantum level and still have the 3rd law holding. I think the 3rd law breakdown is just a consequence of the model used --&gt;

==Importance and range of validity==
Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of [[universal gravitation]] and the mathematical techniques of [[calculus]], provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.

These three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and [[classical electrodynamics]]) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz factor]] must be included in the expression for momentum along with the [[rest mass]] and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a [[semiconductor]], optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected [[GPS]] systems and [[superconductivity]]. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear [[Operator (physics)|operators]] that operate on the [[quantum state]]; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;d'''p'''/d''t'', where '''F''' and '''p''' are [[four-vector]]s.

==Relationship to the conservation laws==
In modern physics, the [[Conservation law (physics)|laws of conservation]] of [[momentum]], energy, and [[angular momentum]] are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.

This can be stated simply, "Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed."

Because force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], etc.). The [[standard model]] explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as [[Gauge theory|gauge forces]] originate out of exchange by [[virtual particles]]. Other forces, such as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle#Consequences|fermionic degeneracy pressure]], also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of [[4-momentum]] in inertial motion via [[curved space-time]] results in what we call [[gravitational force]] in [[general relativity]] theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a [[momentum operator]] in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping [[wave functions]] of a pair of [[fermion]]s (particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the "repulsion" of the fermions.

Newton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase "[[Hypotheses non fingo|I feign no hypotheses]]". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving [[quantum entanglement]]. (In particular, this refers to [[Bell's theorem]] – that no [[local hidden variable theory|local model]] can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory.) Despite only being an approximation, in modern engineering and all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.

The discovery of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in the 19th century showed that not every physical quantity is conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a "steady-state" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take [[entropy]] into account.

{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong'."&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900–1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page=186 |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also often quoted as "That is not only not right; it is not even wrong", or in Pauli's native [[German language|German]], "{{lang|de|Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!}}". Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Notebook Science Challenge''' is a [[crowdsourcing]] research project which collects measurements of the non-aqueous solubility of organic compounds and publishes these as [[open data]]; findings are reported in an [[open notebook science]] manner.  Although anyone may contribute research data, the competition is only open to post-secondary students in the USA and UK.

The challenge in turn forms part of the UsefulChem project, an ongoing [[open notebook science]] effort to synthesize and screen potential new anti-malarial drugs.&lt;ref name="UsefulChem"&gt;[http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/ UsefulChem]&lt;/ref&gt;  Data from the Solubility Challenge will be used to build predictive computational models of solubility for use in optimising syntheses.&lt;ref name="predictions"&gt;[http://rguha.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/ons-solubility-predictions/ ONS solubility modeling and prediction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge began on September 28, 2008&lt;ref name="began"&gt;[http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/09/open-notebook-science-challenge.html The beginning of the Open Notebook Science challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of February 2014, involves researchers and their students from at least 4 different institutions&lt;ref name="experiments"&gt;[http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/list+of+experiments List of experiments]&lt;/ref&gt; and has resulted in the acquisition of over 7672 solubility measurements.&lt;ref name=measurements&gt;[lxsrv7.oru.edu/~alang/onsc/chemspace/cs.php Solubility of Organic Compounds in Organic Solvents]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prizes ==

To encourage participation, each month an award&lt;ref name="award"&gt;[http://www.oru.edu/news/view_news.php?id=1010 A News Story Discussing the Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; is given to the student who does, in the opinion of the judges,&lt;ref name="judges"&gt;[http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/judges ONS Challenge judges]&lt;/ref&gt; the best work. In order to participate, students have to be a US or UK resident.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;[http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/submetaawards08 ONS Challenge Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; The award is a US$500 cash prize. The first three winners also received a year's subscription to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The awards are sponsored by [[Submeta]]&lt;ref name="submeta"&gt;[http://www.submeta.org/index.html submeta]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nature''.

== Request an experiment ==

As well as concentrating on compounds related to the [[Ugi reaction]], the ONSchallenge allows anyone to request a solubility measurement experiment.&lt;ref name="request"&gt;[lxsrv7.oru.edu/~alang/onsc/solubility/solubility.php request a solubility measurement experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical donations ==

[[Sigma Aldrich]] is also an official sponsor of the Open Notebook Science Challenge. Sigma Aldrich is participating by donating and shipping requested chemicals to any experimenters in the US or UK&lt;ref name="Sigma"&gt;[http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2009/02/sigma-aldrich-ships-ons-solubility.html Sigma Aldrich's involvement with the ONS challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; for free.

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;

}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;

Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

{{anchor|tag-linked-open-data}} Three of the projects listed work with [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD), a method of publishing structured data on the [[World Wide Web|web]] so that it can be networked and subject to [[Semantic query|semantic queries]].  The overarching concept is termed the [[semantic web]].  Technically, such projects support [[Representational state transfer|RESTful APIs]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and the [[SPARQL]] query language.

The energydata.info project from the [[World Bank Group]], [[Washington, DC]], USA is an energy database portal designed to support national development by improving public access to energy information.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-website"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Welcome — Energy Data

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).

OpenGridMap employs [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to gather detailed data on electricity network components and then infer a realistic network structure using methods from [[Correlation and dependence|statistics]] and [[graph theory]].  The scope of the project is worldwide and both distribution and transmission networks can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].  The project is managed by the Chair of Business Information Systems, [https://www.in.tum.de/en.html TUM Department of Informatics], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and a [[Facebook]] page and provides an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app]] to help the public document electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s and [[Electrical substation|substations]].

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

'''Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, Inc.''', abbreviated '''oSTEM''', is a 501(c)(3) non-profit professional society dedicated to [[LGBTQ+]] individuals within the [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) community.

==History==

In October 2005, [[IBM]] sponsored a focus group where students from across the United States convened at the [[Human Rights Campaign]] headquarters in [[Washington D.C.]] These students discussed topics relevant to [[LGBTQA]] communities at their own colleges and universities, and they debated how to structure an organization that serves students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbrick.me/tech/look-ostem-lgbt-science-technology-engineering-mathematics/ | title=A Look at oSTEM: Out as LGBT+ in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. |access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2009 and achieving 501(c)(3) status in 2010, oSTEM, Inc. currently consists of more than 50 chapters across the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2017, oSTEM, Inc. expanded its mission to be inclusive of professionals, serving all LGBTQ people in the STEM community.

==Mission==
As an organization dedicated to community, oSTEM, Inc. strives to stay engaged to identify, address, and advocate for the needs of LGBTQA+ students and professionals within the STEM fields. oSTEM, Inc. fulfills these needs in many ways, including networking opportunities, mentorship connections, strategic collaborations and professional/leadership development, as well as an annual global conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/new_uc_san_diego_chapter_sends_lgbt_delegates_to_ostem_conference

Techniques exist for classifying (selecting) aerosol particles in the sub 1,000&amp;nbsp;nm range according to [[electrical mobility]] using devices such as differential mobility analysers.

==Electrical mobility==
In electrical mobility measurement, aerosol particles are classified according to their aerodynamic drag-charge ratio. If the particle is non-spherical, the electrical-mobility diameter will not correspond to any measurable physical dimensions of the particle. (For a spherical particle, the electrical-mobility diameter will correspond to physically measurable diameter.)

==Centrifugal particle mass analyzer==
An alternative technique classifies particles according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]], using opposing electrical and [[centrifugal force]]s. This allows the classifier to select particles of a specified mass-to-charge ratio independent of particle shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehara|title=Novel method to classify aerosol particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio - Aerosol particle mass analyser|journal=Journal of Aerosol Science|date=March 1996|volume=27|issue=2|page=217|doi=10.1016/0021-8502(95)00562-5|ref=1|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1996JAerS..27..217E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Murray-Rust''' (born 1941) is a chemist currently working at the [[University of Cambridge]]. As well as his work in chemistry, Murray-Rust is also known for his support of [[open access]] and [[open data]].

==Education==
He was educated at [[Bootham School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. After obtaining a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] with a thesis entitled ''[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:a5979458-2d50-4bfc-b728-de1f4e0bf14d A structural investigation of some compounds showing charge-transfer properties],'' he became lecturer in chemistry at the (new) [[University of Stirling]] and was first warden of Andrew Stewart Hall of Residence. In 1982, he moved to [[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo]] Group Research at Greenford to head Molecular Graphics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murray-Rust | first1 = P. | authorlink1 = Peter Murray-Rust| last2 = Glusker | first2 = J.

He was Professor of [[Pharmacy]] in the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1996–2000, setting up the Virtual School of Molecular Sciences. He is now Reader Emeritus in Molecular Informatics at the [[University of Cambridge]] and Senior Research Fellow Emeritus of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]].

==Research==
His research interests have involved the automated analysis of data in scientific publications, creation of virtual communities, e.g. The Virtual School of Natural Sciences in the Globewide Network Academy, and the [[Semantic Web]]. With [[Henry Rzepa]], he has extended this to chemistry through the development of [[markup language]]s, especially [[Chemical Markup Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murray-Rust | first1 = P. | authorlink1 = Peter Murray-Rust| last2 = Rzepa | first2 = H.

In 2002, Peter Murray-Rust and his colleagues proposed an electronic repository for unpublished chemical data called the [[World Wide Molecular Matrix]] (WWMM). In January 2011, a symposium around his career and visions was organized, called ''Visions of a Semantic Molecular Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = R. | last2 = MacGillivray | first2 = M. | last3 = Murray-Rust | first3 = P. | authorlink3 = Peter Murray-Rust| last4 = Pitman | first4 = J. | last5 = Sefton | first5 = P. | last6 = O'Steen | first6 = B. | last7 = Waites | first7 = W. | title = Open Bibliography for Science, Technology, and Medicine | doi = 10.1186/1758-2946-3-47 | journal = Journal of Cheminformatics | volume = 3 | pages = 47 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21999661| pmc =3206455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CCL Archives, 2010, http://ccl.net/chemistry/resources/messages/2010/11/12.005-dir/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meeting Archives and publications, 2011, http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/238409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murray-Rust | first1 = P. | authorlink1 = Peter Murray-Rust| doi = 10.1186/1758-2946-3-48 | title = Semantic science and its communication - a personal view | journal = Journal of Cheminformatics | volume = 3 | page = 48| year = 2011 | pmid =  21999715| pmc =3206456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he and Henry Rzepa were joint recipients of the [[Herman Skolnik Award]] of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;CCL Archives, 2011, http://www.ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2011+09+26+014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he was awarded a Fellowship by the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]] to develop the automated mining of science from the literature.

In 2009 Murray-Rust coined the term ''"Doctor Who" model'' for the phenomenon exhibited by the [[Blue Obelisk]] project and other Open Science projects, where when a project leader does not have the resources to continue to lead a project (e.g. because he or she has moved to another university with other tasks), someone else will stand up to become the new leader and continue the project.&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Moody, The Doctor Who Model of Open Source, 2009, http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.nl/2009/06/doctor-who-model-of-open-source.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Murray-Rust, The Doctor Who Model of Open Source, 2009, http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2009/06/06/the-doctor-who-model-of-open-source/&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the long-running British science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', in which the main character periodically [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a different form, which is played by a different actor.

As of 2014, Murray-Rust was granted a Fellowship by [[Shuttleworth Foundation]] in relation to the [http://contentmine.org/ ContentMine] project which uses machines to liberate 100,000,000 facts from the scientific literature.

==Activism==
Murray-Rust is also known for his work on making scientific knowledge from literature freely available, and in such taking a stance against publishers that are not fully compliant with the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|Berlin Declaration on Open Access]]. In 2014, he actively raised awareness of glitches in the publishing system of [[Elsevier]], where restrictions were imposed by Elsevier on the reuse of papers after the authors had paid Elsevier to make the paper freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jump, Elsevier: bumps on road to open access, Times Higher Education, 2014, http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/elsevier-bumps-on-road-to-open-access/2012238.article&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made [[MDPI#Inclusion in Beall's list|statements]] about [[predatory journals]]; he has come under criticism by [[Jeffrey Beall]] for his involvement with publisher [[MDPI]] and for his account of this involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2014/02/18/bealls-criticism-of-mdpi-lacks-evidence-and-is-irresponsible/|title=Beall's criticism of MDPI lacks evidence and is irresponsible|author=|date=|work=cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2014/02/25/mdpi-and-beall-further-comments-from-a-brainwashed-brit/|title=MDPI and Beall - further comments from a "brainwashed Brit"|author=|date=|work=cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Phantom of the Poles''''' is a book written by [[William Reed (hollow earth)|William Reed]], and published in 1906. It attempts to explain certain mysterious phenomena reported by [[polar explorers]] by postulating that the [[Earth]] is in fact [[hollow earth|hollow]], with holes at its [[geographical pole|poles]].

==Phenomena to be explained by the Hollow Earth theory==
In the General Summary chapter of ''The Phantom of the Poles'', Reed posed several questions that he claimed were explained by the Hollow Earth theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/potp/pop4.htm ''General Summary'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} chapter of ''The Phantom of the Poles'' at sacred-texts.com, retrieved November 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Why is the earth [[flattening|flattened]] at the poles?
# Why have the poles never been reached?
# Why does the sun [[day length|not appear for so long]] in winter near the supposed poles?
# Assuming that the earth is hollow, the interior should be warmer.
# We must now resort to the [[compass]]. Does it refuse to work when drawing near the supposed poles?
# [[Meteors]] are constantly falling near the supposed poles. Why? 
# The next query is concerning the great quantities of dust constantly found in the Arctic Ocean. What causes this dust?
# What produces the [[Aurora Borealis]]?
# [[Icebergs]] are next in order. Where are they formed? And how??
# What causes tidal waves?
# What causes colored snow in the Arctic region?
# Why are the nights so long in the polar regions? 
# What causes the great ice-pressure in the Arctic Ocean during still tide and calm weather?
# Why is the ice filled with rock, gravel, and sand? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Failure of Reed's theory==
[[Admiral Peary]] claimed to have reached the [[North Pole]] on April 6, 1909.  This would have invalidated Reed's premise that the poles cannot be reached. Although Peary's claim was, in its day, and continues to be [[Robert Peary#Controversy|controversial]], on December 14, 1911, [[Roald Amundsen]] undisputedly reached the [[South Pole]].  Subsequent expeditions to and flights over the south pole have conclusively demonstrated that there are no large holes there.

[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.]]

A '''prediction''' ([[Latin]] ''præ-'', "before," and ''dicere'', "to say"), or '''[[forecasting|forecast]]''', is a statement about a future [[event (probability theory)|event]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;. A prediction is often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference between the two terms; different authors and disciplines ascribe different [[connotation]]s. (Contrast with [[estimation]].)

Although future events are necessarily [[uncertainty|uncertain]], so guaranteed accurate information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction can be useful to assist in making [[planning|plans]] about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "...  is at least two things: Important and hard."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Howard, ed. ''Do lunch or be lunch''. Boston: [[Harvard Business School Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement-based prediction==
In a non-statistical sense, the term "prediction" is often used to refer to an [[hypothesis|informed guess or opinion]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, A., 2014. Modes of orientation provided by futures studies: making sense of diversity and divergence. European Journal of Futures Research, 2(1), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person's [[abductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical evidence|experience]]; and may be of useful — if the predicting person is a [[expert|knowledgeable person]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Nate (2012) The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail--but some don't. The Penguin Press, New York, 534 p. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delphi method]] is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way.  This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the "data" being used is the predicting expert's [[Cognition|cognitive experiences]] forming an [[intuition|intuitive]] [[Probability density function|"probability curve."]]

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]], prediction is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D. R. (2006). Principles of Statistical Inference, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68567-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=Reference does not mention "forecasting" at all.}} Forecasting usually requires [[time series]] methods, while prediction is often performed on [[cross-sectional data]].

Statistical techniques used for prediction include [[regression analysis]] and its various sub-categories such as [[linear regression]], [[generalized linear model]]s ([[logistic regression]], [[Poisson regression]], [[Probit regression]]), etc. In case of forecasting, [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and [[vector autoregression]] models can be utilized. When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or [[machine learning]] methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as [[predictive analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Eric (2013). Predictive analysis: The power to predict who will click, buy, lie, or die. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ, 302 p. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35685-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many applications, such as time series analysis, it is possible to estimate the models that generate the observations. If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Einicke, G.A.

 | isbn = 978-953-307-752-9
 | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smoothing-filtering-and-prediction-estimating-the-past-present-and-future}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the underlying generating models are linear then a minimum-variance [[Kalman filter]] and a minimum-variance smoother may be used to recover data of interest from noisy measurements. These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors (which minimise the variance of the prediction error). When the generating models are nonlinear then stepwise linearizations may be applied within [[Extended Kalman Filter]] and smoother recursions. However, in nonlinear cases, optimum minimum-variance performance guarantees no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;Julier, S.J., Uhlmann, J.K. (2004). Unscented filtering and nonlinear estimation. Proceedings of the IEEE, 92(3), 401–422. doi =  10.1109/jproc.2003.823141. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1271397.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the [[dependent variable]] or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to influence it, called [[independent variable]]s or explanatory variables. A [[Function (mathematics)#Real-valued functions|functional form]], often linear, is hypothesized for the postulated causal relationship, and the [[parameter]]s of the function are [[estimation|estimated]] from the data—that is, are chosen so as to optimize is some way the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the function, thus parameterized, to the data. That is the estimation step. For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, John (2016) Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models. Sage Publications, London, 791 p, third edition. {{ISBN|978-1-4522-0566-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would happen under specific conditions; for example, if an apple fell from a tree it would be attracted towards the center of the earth by [[gravity]] with a specified and constant [[acceleration]]. The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.

A [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually &lt;!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested--&gt;considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or nescience) until testable predictions can be made.

[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].

In [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. In [[engineering]], possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the mechanism causing the failure.

Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).

===Scientific hypothesis and prediction===
Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.

New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937–946 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.

Mathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions, including brokerage housesand consulting companies.

Some correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.

An [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].

==Sports==

Predicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.

Recent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote “Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won’t put my money on it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan

 | location = New York, United States
 | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4
 | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in “look ahead” games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.

The widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian
 | date = 2008
 | title = NFL Win Prediction Methodology
 | url = http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/nfl-win-prediction-methodology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Pomeroy]] is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics.  His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote “the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dare, William H

==Opinion polls==
[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]

In [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.

==Supernatural prediction==
{{Main|Prophecy}}

Predictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.

In literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.

[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.&lt;ref name="merriamw"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction in fiction==
Fiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.
* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water "mirror" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.
* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''The Golden Man'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.
* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called "[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]" out of the trap.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.

'''Research''' comprises "[[creativity|creative]] and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of [[knowledge]], including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2015), Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on Research and Experimental Development, The Measurement of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Activities, OECD Publishing, Paris. Retrieved on 27 October 2017 from [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264239012-en].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support [[theorem]]s, or develop new [[theory|theories]]. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports.  To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.  The primary purposes of [[basic research]] (as opposed to [[applied research]]) are [[documentation]], [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], or the [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on [[epistemology|epistemologies]], which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: [[scientific]], [[humanities]], [[artistic]], economic, [[social research|social]], business, [[marketing research|marketing]], [[practitioner research]], life, [[technological]], etc.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Aristotle]], (384–322 BC), one of the early figures in the development of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.pbs.org/saf/1307/features/knows.htm The Origins of Science]". ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''research'' is derived from the [[French language|Middle French]] "''recherche''", which means "to go about seeking", the term itself being derived from the [[Old French]] term "''recerchier''" a compound word from "re-" + "cerchier", or "sercher", meaning 'search'.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/research|title=Research|author=|first=|date=|website=Merriam Webster (https://www.merriam-webster.com/)|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
Research has been defined in a number of different ways, and while there are similarities, there does not appear to be a single, all-encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it.

One definition of research is used by the OECD, "Any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Research and development � UNESCO Definition|last=|first=|date=|website=stats.oecd.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219233912/http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|archive-date=2007-02-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of research is given by [[John W. Creswell]], who states that  "research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue". It consists of three steps: pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). Educational Research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as "studious inquiry or examination;  ''especially'' : investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws"&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Forms of research{{anchor|Original research}} ==

{{selfref|"Original research" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, see [[Wikipedia:No original research]]}}
'''Original research''' is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a [[primary source]] character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new [[knowledge]], rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form (''e.g.'', summarized or classified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Original Research?  Original research is considered a primary source|url=http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|publisher=Thomas G. Carpenter Library, University of North Florida|accessdate=9 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709085129/http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|archivedate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlIH4R9Z_k8C&amp;pg=PT75|title=Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers|first=Laurie|last=Rozakis|date=15 June 2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071511223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the [[methodology]], results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In [[Scientific modelling|analytical]] work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the [[Academic authorship|researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |title=Early career researcher originality: Engaging Richard Florida's international competition for creative workers |first=Michael |last=Singh |author2=Li, Bingyi |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=Centre for Educational Research, University of Western Sydney |page=2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64cuvN4SB?url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |access-date=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in [[academic journal]]s and usually established by means of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaham |first=Michael |last2=Wears|first2= Robert|last3=Weber|first3=Ellen L. |title=Journal Prestige, Publication Bias, and Other Characteristics Associated With Citation of Published Studies in Peer-Reviewed Journals |journal=Jama |volume=287 |issue=21 |pages=2847–50 |year=2002 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.short |doi=10.1001/jama.287.21.2847|pmid=12038930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graduate student]]s are commonly required to perform original research as part of a [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oFFWt5oyA3oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22original+research%22&amp;cd=90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22original+research%22&amp;f=false|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition|first=The United States Department of|last=Labor|date=26 June 2006|publisher=Mcgraw-hill|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071472883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific research''' is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing [[curiosity]]. This research provides [[science|scientific]] information and theories for the explanation of the [[nature]] and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Business%20School%20Prestige.pdf | title = Business School Prestige: Research versus Teaching | author1 = J.

'''Research in the humanities''' involves different methods such as for example [[hermeneutics]] and [[semiotics]]. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in [[historical method]]. Historians use [[primary sources]] and other [[evidence]] to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these. These studies may be qualitative or quantitative, and can use a variety of approaches, such as queer theory or feminist theory.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A|last2=Waling|first2=Andrea|date=18 August 2016|title=Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying|journal=Research Ethics|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.1177/1747016116658693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artistic research''', also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

=== Scientific research ===

{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:Microscopy lab.jpg|thumb|right|Primary scientific research being carried out at the [[Electron microscope|Microscopy]] Laboratory of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].]]

Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural [[Process (science)|process]]. Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Observations and formation of the topic]]: Consists of the subject area of one's interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# [[Hypothesis]]: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# [[Conceptual definition]]: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# [[Operational definition]]:  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# [[Data collection|Gathering of data]]: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# [[Data analysis|Analysis of data]]: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
# [[Data Interpretation]]: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words.
# [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|Test, revising of hypothesis]]
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Conclusion, reiteration if necessary]]

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, [[null hypothesis]]). Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment.  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see [[falsifiability]]). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.

A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables.

=== Historical research ===
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:Leopold von Ranke 1868.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886), considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based history.]]

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes [[lower criticism]] and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:&lt;ref name="Garraghan  (1946)"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Historical Method |last=Garraghan |first=Gilbert J. |year=1946 |publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8371-7132-6 |page=168 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Evidence]] of localization
* [[Recognition (sociology)|Recognition]] of authorship
* [[Analysis]] of data
* Identification of [[integrity]]
* Attribution of [[credibility]]

=== Artistic research ===
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesage  |first1=Dieter |date=Spring 2009 |title=Who's Afraid of Artistic Research? On measuring artistic research output |journal=Art&amp;Research – A Journal of Ideas, Contexts and Methods  |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n2/pdfs/lesage.pdf |issn=1752-6388 |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept [[subjectivity]] as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the [[social science]]s in using [[qualitative research]] and [[intersubjectivity]] as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Eisner | first1 = E.

Artistic research has been defined by the [[University of Dance and Circus]] (Dans och Cirkushögskolan, DOCH), [[Stockholm]] in the following manner - "Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."&lt;ref name="DOCH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doch.se/web/Artistic_Research.aspx |title=Artistic research at DOCH |author=Unattributed |website=Dans och Cirkushögskolan (website) |publisher= |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, M. (2009). Draft Proposal. Journal for Artistic Research. Bern University of the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; A more simple understanding by [[Julian Klein]] defines Artistic Research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, J.

According to artist [[Hakan Topal]], in artistic research, "perhaps more so than other disciplines, intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909042922/http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|dead-url=no|archive-date=2014-09-09|title=Topal, H.

== Steps in conducting research ==
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research.&lt;ref&gt;Trochim, W.M.K, (2006). Research Methods Knowledge Base.&lt;/ref&gt; The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008 {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}} (pages 8–9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification of research problem
* [[Literature review]]
* Specifying the purpose of research
* Determining specific research questions
* Specification of a [[conceptual framework]], sometimes including a set of hypotheses&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choice of a methodology (for data collection)
* Data collection
* Verifying data
* Analyzing and interpreting the data
* Reporting and evaluating research
* Communicating the research findings and, possibly, recommendations

The steps generally represent the overall process; however, they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps.&lt;ref&gt;Gauch, Jr., H.G. (2003). Scientific method in practice. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-81689-0}} (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, T.S., Hatcher, T., &amp; Creswell, J.W. (2011). The handbook of scholarly writing and publishing. San Francisco, CA: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-470-39335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a [[literature review]] is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified.  A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question.  The research question may be parallel to the [[hypothesis]].  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.  The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as [[empirical research]]. The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the [[null hypothesis]] are then reported and evaluated. At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for [[Further research is needed|further research]]. However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving "up" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review. The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted.

[[Rudolph Rummel]] says, "... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MTF.CHAP9.HTM|title=QUESTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM, DEMOCIDE, AND WAR|author=|date=|website=www.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] in [[Meno]] talks about an inherent difficulty, if not a paradox, of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way, "If you know what you're searching for, why do you search for it?! [i.e., you have already found it] If you don't know what you're searching for, what are you searching for?!"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, &amp; Bluck, R. S. (1962). Meno. Cambridge, UK: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC Public Library Research Room Jan 2006-1- 3.jpg|thumb|The research room at the New York Public Library, an example of [[secondary research]] in progress.]]
[[File:Hilleman-Walter-Reed.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sullivan P |date=13 April 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48244-2005Apr12.html |title=Maurice R.

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* [[Exploratory research]], which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* [[Constructive research]], which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* [[Empirical research]], which tests the feasibility of a solution using [[empirical evidence]].
There are two major types of empirical research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:

;[[Qualitative research]]
:This involves understanding human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior, by asking a broad question, collecting data in the form of words, images, video etc that is analyzed, and searching for themes. This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables. It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[social constructionism]].

[[Social media]] posts are used for qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snelson|first1=Chareen L.|title=Qualitative and Mixed Methods Social Media Research|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|date=March 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=160940691562457|doi=10.1177/1609406915624574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Quantitative research]]
:This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships, by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing [[Descriptive statistical technique|statistical]] methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive).&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). ''Educational Research:  Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ. Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[positivism]].

The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These methods produce results that are easy to summarize, compare, and generalize.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.

If the research question is about people, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uwec.edu/piercech/ResearchMethods/Data%20collection%20methods/DATA%20COLLECTION%20METHODS.htm|title=Data Collection Methods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=uwec.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data.  Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires.  Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research.  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.102. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.114. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer. For example, a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creswell|first1=John W.|title=Research design : qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=978-1-4522-2609-5|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Big data]] has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection; furthermore, methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|date = 1 January 2015|isbn = 9781118900772|first = Alex|last = Liu|doi = 10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0325|title = Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages = 1–15|chapter = Structural Equation Modeling and Latent Variable Approaches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Non-empirical research
Non-empirical ([[theory|theoretical]]) research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation. As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source. This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge. Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach. Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science. Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on. See [[Scientific method]].

A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge. Much of [[cosmology|cosmological research]] is theoretical in nature. [[Mathematics]] research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove [[theorem]]s about [[mathematical object]]s.

== Research ethics&lt;!--'Research ethics' redirects here--&gt; ==
'''Research ethics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; involves the application of fundamental ethical principles to a variety of topics involving research, including [[scientific research]]. These principles include [[deontology]], [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]] and [[value (ethics)]]. Ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving [[human experimentation]] or [[animal experimentation]], such as: various aspects of [[academic scandal]], including [[scientific misconduct]] (such as fraud, [[fabrication (science)|fabrication of data]] and [[plagiarism]]), [[whistleblowing]]; regulation of research, etc.  Research ethics is most developed as a concept in [[medical research]]. The key agreement here is the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. The [[Nuremberg Code]] is a former agreement, but with many still important notes. Research in the [[Ethical research in social science|social sciences]] presents a different set of issues than those in medical research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research {{!}} On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research|date=2009|publisher=The National Academies Press|edition=Third|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12192/chapter/2#2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can involve issues of researcher and participant safety, empowerment and access to justice.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"/&gt;

When research involves human subjects, obtaining [[informed consent]] from them is essential.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book" /&gt;

== Problems in research ==

=== Methods of research ===
In many disciplines, Western methods of conducting research are predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reverby|first=Susan M.|date=1 April 2012|title=Zachary M. Schrag. Ethical Imperialism: Institutional Review Boards and the Social Sciences, 1965–2009. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2010. Pp. xii, 245. $45.00|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/2/484.2|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=117|issue=2|pages=484–485|doi=10.1086/ahr.117.2.484-a|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study. The increasing participation of [[indigenous peoples]] as researchers has brought increased attention to the lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples|url=https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/decolonizing-methodologies/|last=Smith|first=Linda Tuhiwai|publisher=Zed Books|year=2012|isbn=9781848139503|edition=2nd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies. For example, "[[Hua Oranga]]" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in [[Māori people|Māori]] populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – "taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Lisa|title=Commentary on Cultural Diversity Across the Pacific: The Dominance of Western Theories, Models, Research and Practice in Psychology|url=http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1834490912000013|journal=Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1017/prp.2012.1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguicism ===
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and [[linguicism]] in research and academic publication. As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=A. Suresh|date=1 January 1996|title=From Critical Research Practice to Critical Research Reporting|jstor=3588146|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=321–331|doi=10.2307/3588146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingual scholars' influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=October 1996|title="Nondiscursive" Requirements in Academic Publishing, Material Resources of Periphery Scholars, and the Politics of Knowledge Production|url=|journal=Written Communication|volume=13|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication Peer Review ===
{{update|reason=This subsection's claims are potentially outdated in the "digital age" given that near-total penetration of Web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar[s] to submit papers to any journal anywhere|date=May 2017}}
[[Peer review]] is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, [[scholarly peer review]] is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication. Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge. The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peerviewer.com/freelance-peer-review-scholarly-journals/|title=Peer Review of Scholarly Journal|website=www.PeerViewer.com|language=en-US|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah" /&gt; These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide.

=== Influence of the open-access movement ===
The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a "public domain", that of "humanity".&lt;ref name="Christen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christen|first=Kimberly|date=2012|title=Does Information Really Want to be Free? Indigenous Knowledge Systems and the Question of Openness|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1618|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=6|issue=|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation. For instance, most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;

There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system. On the one hand, "digital right management" used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy, while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups (i.e. indigenous communities) this is denounced as "access control" and reprehended as censorship.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;



=== Future perspectives ===
Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research, some scholars, such as Simon Marginson, argue for "the need [for] a plural university world".&lt;ref name="Marginson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sun-sets-on-western-dominance-as-east-asian-confucian-model-takes-lead/415300.article|title=Sun sets on Western dominance as East Asian Confucian model takes lead|date=24 February 2011|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.

This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West. Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion.&lt;ref name="Marginson" /&gt; In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some {{who|date=February 2017}} say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research.

== Professionalisation {{anchor|Professionalization}} ==
{{globalize|section|date=January 2014}}
{{see also|Academic ranks|Academics|Scientists}}
In several national and private academic systems, the [[professionalisation]] of research has resulted in formal [[job title]]s.

=== In Russia ===
In present-day Russia, the former [[Soviet Union]] and in some [[post-Soviet states]] the term ''researcher'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Научный сотрудник}}, ''nauchny sotrudnik'') is both a generic term for a person who carried out scientific research, as well as a job position within the frameworks of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], Soviet universities, and in other research-oriented establishments. The term is also sometimes translated as ''[[research fellow]]'', ''[[research associate]]'', etc.

The following ranks are known:

*Junior Researcher (Junior Research Associate)
*Researcher (Research Associate)
*Senior Researcher (Senior Research Associate)
*Leading Researcher (Leading Research Associate)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aup.ru/docs/d2/210.htm Job qualifications for Leading Researcher] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chief Researcher (Chief Research Associate)

== Publishing ==
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869.]]
[[Academic publishing]] is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to [[peer review]] the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.
[https://fine-research-paper.com research paper guides]
Most established [[List of academic disciplines|academic fields]] have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many [[academic journal]]s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format.

== Research funding ==
{{Main|Funding of science}}
Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources: [[Corporation|corporate]] [[research and development]] departments; [[private foundation]]s, for example, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]; and government research councils such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Reporter|url=http://report.nih.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit.

The [[Social Psychology Network]] provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.

[[Image:NCSU SCALE-UP Room.jpg|thumb|A 99-seat room at [[NCSU]]]]

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

==Philosophy==
Science Buddies mission is to help students to build their literacy in science and technology so they can become productive and engaged citizens in the 21st century.

The site has personalized learning tools, over 15,000 pages of scientist-developed subject matter (including experiments based on the latest academic research), and an online community of science professionals who volunteer to advise students. 

Science Buddies also provides resources to support parents and teachers as they guide students seeking out and performing science projects. They attempt to provide a bridge between scientists, engineers, educators, and students, giving students access to current scientific research and simultaneously giving scientists a way to reach out to young people interested in their fields.

==About Science Buddies==
Noticing how much fun his teenage daughter had participating in science fairs but dismayed to discover a shortage of quality science fair help online, Ken Hess thought science fair "productivity tools" and mentoring would allow many more students to participate in science fairs and develop inspirational relationships with science role models. Over time, such a program would help students improve their science skills and literacy while inspiring them to consider careers in science and engineering. So, in early 2001, Ken Hess started a charity with a mission of developing online tools and support for students doing science fair projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/tip/2003/oct03/buddies.htm Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center Interaction Point newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science and Engineering Challenge''' [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|(SEC)]] is a non-profit, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] outreach program run throughout the schools year in [[Australia]]. The goal of the program is to challenge student’s perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment.&lt;ref name="Challenge Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-engineering-and-built-environment/science-and-engineering-challenge|title=About Us|date=19 November 2014|website=Newcastle.edu.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the [https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-information-technology/community-outreach/smart S.M.A.R.T] outreach program.

==History==
The SEC began at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering.  Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the year 2000, as an activity for [[National Science Week]]. Throughout 2001, events were held around the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] area and other parts of [[NSW]].

2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of [[NSW]], this took place in [[Canberra]]. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final.

In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved.
Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.

== Discovery Days ==

In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

== Programs ==

#The Little Scientists program: Train preschool teachers to incorporate STEM into their lessons
#SMART program of science shows and workshops: Infants and Primary-aged students

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

[[File:Science Communication – schematic overview.png|thumb|Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication according to Carsten Könneker]]
'''Science communication''' is the public [[communication]] of science-related topics to non-experts. This often involves professional scientists (called "[[science outreach|outreach]]" or "[[Popularization of science|popularization]]"), but has also evolved into a [[popular science|professional field]] in its own right. It includes science exhibitions, [[Science journalism|journalism]], [[Science policy|policy]] or media production. Science communication also includes communication between scientists (for instance through [[scientific journals]]), as well as between scientists and non-scientists (especially during public controversies over science and in [[citizen science]] initiatives).
 
Science communication may generate support for [[Scientific method|scientific research]] or [[Science education|study]], or to inform [[decision making]], including [[political]] and [[ethical]] thinking. There is increasing emphasis on explaining methods rather than simply findings of science. This may be especially critical in addressing scientific [[misinformation]], which spreads easily because it is not subject to the constraints of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilgartner/&gt;&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;
'''Science communicators'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; can use [[entertainment]] and [[persuasion]] including [[humour]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[storytelling]] and [[metaphors]].&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt; Scientists can be trained in some of the techniques used by [[actors]] to improve their communication.&lt;ref name=Viola/&gt;

==Motivations==
Partly due to a market for professional training, science communication is also an academic discipline. Journals include ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'' and ''Science Communication''. Researchers in this field are often linked to [[Science and Technology Studies]], but may also come from [[history of science]], mainstream [[media studies]], [[psychology]] or [[sociology]]. As a reflection of growth in this field, academic departments, such as the ''Department of Life Sciences Communication'' at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], have been established to focus on applied and theoretical communication issues. [[Agricultural communication]] is considered a subset of science communication from an academic and professional standpoint relating to agriculture-related information among agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. [[Health communication]] is a related discipline.
Writing in 1987, Geoffery Thomas and John Durant advocated various reasons to increase public understanding of science, or [[scientific literacy]]. If the public enjoyed science more, they suggested there would presumably be more funding, progressive regulation, and trained scientists. More trained engineers and scientists could allow a nation to be more competitive economically.&lt;ref name=GregMiller&gt;As summarised in Gregory, Jane &amp; Steve Miller (1998) Science in Public: communication, culture and credibility (New York: Plenum), 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Science can also benefit individuals. Science can simply have aesthetic appeal (e.g. [[popular science]] or [[science fiction]]). Living in an increasingly technological society, background scientific knowledge can help to negotiate it. The [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] is an example of a field whose research can have direct and obvious implications for individuals.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;
Governments and societies might also benefit from more scientific literacy, since an informed electorate promotes a more [[democratic society]].&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt; Moreover, science can inform moral [[decision making]] (e.g. answering questions about whether [[Pain in animals|animals can feel pain]], how [[Climate change|human activity influences climate]], or even a [[science of morality]]).
[[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] points out potential pitfalls in improving scientific literacy. He explains first that we must avoid 'scientific idolatry'. In other words, science education must allow the public to respect science without worshiping it, or expecting infallibility. Ultimately scientists are humans, and neither perfectly altruistic, nor perfectly competent. Science communicators must also appreciate the distinction between understanding science and possessing a transferable skill of scientific thinking. Indeed, even trained scientists do not always manage to transfer the skill to other areas of their life.

Communicating science to the public is increasingly important in today's society. However according to some research, some scientists do not have the skills necessary to do so effectively. There has been some research done over why this is, and it has been found that the stereotype of scientists is the main reason they will not communicate to the public often. The "Draw a Scientist" experiment proves that from a young age, most people assume that scientists are unsocial, so scientists use that as a reason to not communicate.

Cohen is critical of what has been called "[[Scientism]]" – the claim that science is the best or only way to solve all problems. He also criticizes the teaching of 'miscellaneous information' and doubts that much of it will ever be of any use, (e.g. the distance in light years from the Earth to various stars, or the names of minerals). Much of scientific knowledge, particularly if it is not the subject of public debate and policy revision, may never really translate to practical changes for the lives of the learners.&lt;ref name=GregMiller/&gt;

Many criticisms of academic research in [[public understanding of science]] come from scholars in [[Science and Technology Studies]]. For example, Steven Hilgartner (1990)&lt;ref name=Hilgartner&gt;Hilgartner, Stephen (1990) ‘The Dominant View of Popularization: Conceptual Problems, Political Uses, Social Studies of Science, vol. 20(3): 519-539.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that what he calls 'the dominant view' of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a [[deficit model|deficient public]] as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to contrast their own identity as experts. The process of popularization is a form of boundary work. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but its very existence only acts to emphasise it: as if the scientific community only invited the public to play in order to reinforce its most powerful boundary (according to work by [[Massimiano Bucchi]] or [[Brian Wynne]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimiano Bucchi]] (1998) Science and the Media (London &amp; New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Brian (1992) ‘Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science’, ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 1 (3): 281-304. See also Irwin, Alan &amp; Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) ''Misunderstanding Science'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Randy Olson]] adds that anti-science groups can often be so motivated, and so well funded, that the impartiality of science organizations in politics can lead to crises of public understanding of science. He cites examples of [[denialism]] (for instance of [[global warming]]) to support this worry.&lt;ref name=POIOlson&gt;(23 October 2009.) [http://www.pointofinquiry.org/randy_olson_dont_be_such_a_scientist/ "Randy Olson - Don’t Be Such a Scientist."] (Includes podcast). [http://www.pointofinquiry.org Pointofinquiry.org]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] likewise argues that the stories scientists tell are invariably competing with the efforts of people like [[Adnan Oktar]]. Krulwich explains that attractive, easy to read, and cheap [[creationist]] textbooks were sold by the thousands to schools in Turkey (despite their strong secular tradition) due to the efforts of Oktar.&lt;ref name=Krulwich&gt;Miller, Lulu (29 July 2008).[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/jul/29/tell-me-a-story/ "Tell Me a Story."] (Includes podcast).

==Methods==
[[File:Physicsworks.ogv|thumb|[[Walter Lewin]] demonstrates conservation of potential energy. It can be difficult to captivatingly share good scientific thinking as well as scientifically accurate information. Krulwich and Olson believe scientists must rise to that challenge using metaphor and story telling.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;]]

Marine biologist and film-maker [[Randy Olson]] published ''Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style''. In the book he describes how there has been this unproductive negligence when it comes to teaching scientists to communicate. ''Don't be Such a Scientist'' is written to his fellow scientists, and he says they need to "lighten up". He adds that scientists are ultimately the most responsible for promoting and explaining science to the public and media. This, Olson says, should be done according to a good grasp of [[social science]]; scientists must use [[persuasive]] and effective means like [[story telling]]. Olson acknowledges that the stories told by scientists need not only be compelling but also accurate to modern science - and says this added challenge must simply be confronted. He points to figures like [[Carl Sagan]] as effective popularizers, partly because such figures actively cultivate a likeable image.&lt;ref name=POIOlson/&gt;

Science popularization figures such as Carl Sagan and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Neil Degrasse Tyson]] are partly responsible for the view of science or a specific science discipline within the general public. However, the degree of knowledge and experience a science popularizer has can vary greatly. Because of this, some can depend on sensationalism. As a Forbes contributor put it, "The main job of physics popularizers is the same as it is for any celebrity: get more famous."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Neil deGrasse Tyson's Role in the Scientific Community? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/11/what-is-neil-degrasse-tysons-role-in-the-scientific-community/#17afaca875a5 |website=Forbes |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this variation in experience, research scientists can sometimes question the credibility of science popularizers. Another point in the controversy of popular science is the idea of how public debate can affect public opinion. A relevant and highly public example of this is [[climate change]]. A science communication study appearing in the New York Times proves that "even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader’s perception of a [science news] story” and that even “firmly worded (but not uncivil) disagreements between commenters affected readers’ perception of science.”&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes some to worry that the popularizing of science in the public, questioning whether the further popularization of science will cause pressure towards generalization or sensationalism. Unfortunately, this question will fall to time for an answer.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Lynda |title=The Double-Edged Sword of Popularization |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1075547015581928 |website=Science Communication |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his commencement address to [[Caltech]] students, journalist [[Robert Krulwich]] delivered a speech entitled "Tell me a story". Krulwich says that scientists are actually given many opportunities to explain something interesting about science or their work, and that they must seize such opportunities. He says scientists must resist shunning the public, as [[Sir Isaac Newton]] did in his writing, and instead embrace metaphors the way [[Galileo]] did; Krulwich suggests that metaphors only become more important as the science gets more difficult to understand. He adds that telling stories of science in practice, of scientists' success stories and struggles, helps convey that scientists are real people. Finally, Krulwich advocates for the importance of scientific values in general, and helping the public to understand that scientific views are not mere opinions, but hard-won knowledge.&lt;ref name=Krulwich/&gt;

Actor [[Alan Alda]] helps scientists and PhD students get more comfortable with communication with the help of [[drama]] coaches (they use the acting techniques of [[Viola Spolin]]).&lt;ref name=Viola&gt;Grushkin, Daniel (5 August 2010). [http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57611/ "Try acting like a scientist"] [http://the-scientist.com/ The Scientist Magazine]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagining science's publics===
In the preface of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote: "Three imaginary readers looked over my shoulder while I was writing, and I now dedicate the book to them. [...] First the general reader, the layman [...] second the expert [and] third the student".

[[File:Science &amp; Technology Fair 2011 - Kolkata 2011-02-09 0921.JPG|thumb|Students explain science projects to visitors. Susanna Hornig promotes the message that anyone can meaningfully engage with science, even without going as deeply into it as the researchers themselves do.&lt;ref name=Priest/&gt;]]

Many criticisms of the [[public understanding of science]] movement have emphasized that this thing they were calling the public was somewhat of an (unhelpful) black box. Approaches to the public changed with the move away from the public understanding of science. Science communication researchers and practitioners now often showcase their desire to listen to non-scientists as well as acknowledging an awareness of the fluid and complex nature of (post/late) modern social identities.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Irwin, Alan &amp; Michael, Mike (2003) Science, Social Theory and Public Knowledge (Maidenhead &amp; Philadelphia: Open University Press). chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, people will use plurals: [[publics]] or audiences. As the editor of [[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]] put it in a special issue on publics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have clearly moved from the old days of the deficit frame and thinking of publics as monolithic to viewing publics as active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science. (Einsiedel, 2007: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Einsiedel, Edna (2005) ‘Editorial: Of Publics and Science’, Public Understanding of Science, vol. 16(1): 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Einsiedel goes on to suggest both views of the public are "monolithic" in their own way; they both choose to declare what something called the public is. [[Public understanding of science]] might have ridiculed publics for their ignorance, but an alternative "public engagement with science and technology" romanticizes its publics for their participatory instincts, intrinsic morality or simple collective wisdom. As Susanna Hornig Priest (2009)&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;Priest, Susanna Hornig (2009) ‘Reinterpreting the audiences for media messages about science’, in Richard Holliman et al (eds) Investigating Science Communication in the Information Age: Implications for Public Engagement and Popular Media (Oxford: Oxford University Press) 223-236.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes in her recent introduction essay on science’s contemporary audiences, the job of science communication might be to help non-scientists feel they are not excluded as opposed to always included; that they can join in if they want, rather than that there is a necessity to spend their lives engaging.

The process of quantifiably surveying public opinion of science is now largely associated with the [[public understanding of science]] movement (some would say unfairly&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable ‘attentive’ or ‘interested’ publics (that is to say science fans) and those who do not care much about science and technology. Miller’s work questioned whether the American public had the following four attributes of scientific literacy:
* knowledge of basic textbook scientific factual knowledge
* an understanding of scientific method
* appreciated the positive outcomes of science and technology
* rejected superstitious beliefs, such as astrology or numerology&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bauer, Nick Allum and Steve Miller, "What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research? Liberating and expanding the agenda", ''[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]'', volume 16, 2007, pages 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, John Durant’s work surveying British public&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Durant, John, GA Evans &amp; GP Thomas (1989) ‘The Public Understanding of Science’, Nature 340: 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; applied similar ideas to Miller. However, they were slightly more concerned with attitudes to science and technology, rather than just how much knowledge people had. They also looked at public confidence in their knowledge, considering issues such as the gender of those ticking "don’t know" boxes. We can see aspects of this approach, as well as a more "public engagement with science and technology" influenced one, reflected within the [[Eurobarometer]] studies of public opinion. These have been running since 1973 to monitor public opinion in the member states, with the aim of helping the preparation of policy (and evaluation of policy). They look at a host of topics, not just science and technology but also defence, the [[euro]], enlargement of the European Union, and culture. Eurobarometer’s recent study of Europeans’ Attitudes to Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;(September 2008.) [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_300_full_en.pdf "Europeans’ attitudes towards climate change."] European Parliament and European Commission (accessed in May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. It focuses on respondents’ "subjective level of information"; asking "personally, do you think that you are well informed or not about…?" rather than checking what people knew.

===Frame analysis===
Science communication can be analysed through [[frame analysis]], a research method used to analyse how people understand situations and activities.

Some features of this analysis are listed below.
* '''Public accountability''': placing a blame on public actions for value, e.g. political gain in the climate change debate
* '''Runaway technology''': creating a certain view of technological advancements, e.g. photos of an exploded nuclear power plant
* '''Scientific uncertainty''': questioning the reliability of a scientific theory, e.g. arguing how bad global climate change can be if humans are still alive&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nisbet, Matthew C. (2009). Communicating Climate Change: Why Frames Matter for Public Engagement. Environment (Online at http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/Nisbet-full.html, retrieved 20 October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristics ===
People make an enormous number of decisions every day, and to approach all of them in a careful, methodical manner is impractical. They therefore often use mental shortcuts known as "[[heuristic]]s" to quickly arrive at acceptable inferences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E. (1991). ''Social Cognition'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] originally proposed three heuristics, listed below, although there are many others that have been discussed in later research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=27 September 1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Representativeness heuristic|'''Representativeness''']]: used to make assumptions about probability based on relevancy, e.g. how likely item A is to be a member of category B (is Kim a chef?), or that event C resulted from process D (could the sequence of coin tosses H-H-T-T have occurred randomly?).
* [[Availability heuristic|'''Availability''']]: used to estimate how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate the number of people in your age group that are currently in college, your judgment would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college.
* [[Anchoring|'''Anchoring and adjustment''']]: used when making judgments with uncertainties. One will start with an anchoring point, then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall.
The most effective science communication efforts take into account the role that heuristics play in everyday decision-making. Many outreach initiatives focus solely on increasing the public's knowledge, but studies (e.g. Brossard et al. 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brossard|first=Dominique|last2=Lewenstein|first2=Bruce|last3=Bonney|first3=Rick|date=1 January 2005|title=Scientific knowledge and attitude change: The impact of a citizen science project|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690500069483|journal=International Journal of Science Education|volume=27|issue=9|pages=1099–1121|doi=10.1080/09500690500069483|issn=0950-0693}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that there is little – if any – correlation between knowledge levels and attitudes towards scientific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, D. A. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. In J. Turney (Ed.), Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action (pp. 20-25). London: The Wellcome Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simulation ====
{{Main|Simulation heuristic}}

The simulation heuristic is used to judge how likely certain outcomes are based on the ease with which one can imagine a particular ending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This heuristic can be used for many tasks, including prediction (Will the Jets win this football game?) and causality (Did Jim eat the last slice of pizza?). An application of this heuristic is to the case of near misses. Consider the following example from Kahneman &amp; Tversky:&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A. (1981). ''The simulation heuristic''. (Report No. 5). Retrieved from http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA099504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane and Mr. Tees were scheduled to leave the airport on different flights, at the same time. They traveled from town in the same limousine, were caught in a traffic jam, and arrived at the airport thirty minutes after the scheduled departure time of their flights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane is told his flight left on time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Tees is told that his flight was delayed, and just left five minutes ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is more upset?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Crane or Mr. Tees?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Almost everyone says, "Mr. Tees", because they cannot imagine how Mr. Crane could have caught his flight, while Mr. Tees might have made it if not for that slow pedestrian, or the exceptionally long security line. The simulation heuristic has this ability to generate "if only" conditions, which can be used to understand the negative feelings of frustration, indignation, etc. that arise from near misses such as that of Mr. Tees.

This simulation of how events ''might'' have occurred is referred to as [[counterfactual thinking]], and can be used to try to identify a unique or unusual circumstance that lead to a dramatic outcome. For example, consider a man who is shot during a robbery while shopping at a convenience store. Subjects will award more damages to a man who was shopping at a store far from his house than they will to a man who was shopping at a store near his home that he commonly visits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regarding simulations of future events, simply imagining hypothetical events makes them seem more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Paul|last2=Harris|first2=Peter R.|last3=Raats|first3=Monique|date=1 April 2003|title=Imagining and Explaining Hypothetical Scenarios: Mediational Effects on the Subjective Likelihood of Health-Related Outcomes1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=33|issue=4|pages=869–887|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01929.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=W.

=== Birth of public science ===
While scientific study began to emerge as a popular discourse following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], science was not widely funded or exposed to the public until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.berkeley.edu|publisher=Berkeley University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most science prior to this was funded by individuals under private [[patronage]] and was studied in exclusive groups, like the [[Royal Society]]. [[Public science]] emerged due to a gradual [[Marxism|social change]], resulting from the rise of the middle class in the nineteenth century. As scientific inventions, like the [[conveyor belt]] and the [[steam locomotive]] entered and enhanced the lifestyle of people in the nineteenth century, scientific inventions began to be widely funded by [[University|universities]] and other public institutions in an effort to increase scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science.html|title=Science Technology Timeline|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since scientific achievements were beneficial to society, the pursuit of scientific knowledge resulted in science as a [[profession]]. Scientific institutions, like the [[National Academy of Sciences]] or the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] are examples of leading platforms for the public discussion of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/baas.htm|title=BAAS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brewster]], founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, believed in regulated publications in order to effectively communicate their discoveries, "so that scientific students may know where to begin their labours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/history|title=British Science Association History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britishscienceassociation.org|publisher=British Science Association|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communication of science reached a wider audience, due to the [[professionalization]] of science and its introduction to the [[public sphere]], the interest in the subject increased.

=== Scientific media in the 19th century ===
There was a change in media production in the nineteenth century. The invention of the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] [[printing press]] enabled more pages to be printed per hour, which resulted in cheaper texts. Book prices gradually dropped, which gave the [[working class]]es the ability to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/fyfe.html#audience|title=A Review of Aileen Fyfe's Science and Salvation: Evangelical Popular Science Publishing in Victorian Britain|last=Landow|first=George P.|date=25 May 2005|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer reserved for the elite, affordable and informative texts were made available to a mass audience. Historian Aileen Fyfe noted that, as the nineteenth century experienced a set of [[:Category:19th-century reform movements|social reforms]] that sought to improve the lives of those in the working classes, the availability of public knowledge was valuable for intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=www.victorianweb.org|publisher=National University of Ireland|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were reform efforts to further the knowledge of the less educated. The [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], led by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], attempted to organize a system for widespread literacy for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/59807?backToResults=%2Fsearch%2Frefine%2F%3FdocStart=1%26themesTabShow=true|title=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (act. 1826–1846)|last=Ashton|first=Rosemary|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, weekly [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], like the ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', were aimed to educate the general public on scientific achievements in a comprehensive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge|title=The Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|last=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|first=|date=2012|website=archive.org|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|left|thumb|[[Friedrich Koenig|Fredrich Koenig]]'s stream powered [[printing press]], 1814.]]
As the audience for scientific texts expanded, the interest in public science did as well. 'Extension lectures' were installed in some universities, like [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], which encouraged members of the public to attend lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=About the University: Nineteenth and twentieth centuries|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, travelling lectures were a common occurrence in the nineteenth century and attracted hundreds of viewers. These [[public lecture]]s were a part of the [[lyceum movement]] and demonstrated basic [[Experiment|scientific experiments]], which advanced scientific knowledge for both the educated and uneducated viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh.dickinson.edu/digitalmuseum/exhibit-artifact/making-the-invisible-visible/showing-scientific-lecturing-19th-century|title=Showing off: Scientific Lecturing in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=|website=The Dickinsonia History Project|publisher=Dickinson College|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the popularization of [[public science]] enlighten the general public through [[mass media]], but it also enhanced communication within the [[scientific community]]. Although scientists had been communicating their discoveries and achievements through print for centuries, publications with a variety of subjects decreased in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/sci_publishing.html|title=Science Publishing|last=Fyfe|first=Aileen|date=|website=|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, publications in discipline-specific journals were crucial for a successful career in the sciences in the nineteenth century. As a result, [[scientific journal]]s such as [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] or [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']] possessed a large readership and received substantial funding by the end of the nineteenth century as the popularization of science continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making "Nature": The History of a Scientific Journal|last=Brown|first=Melinda|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0226261454|location=Chicago, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication of science in contemporary media ===
Science can be communicated to the public in many different ways. According to Karen Bultitude, a science communication lecturer at [[University College London]], these can be broadly categorised into three groups: traditional journalism, live or face-to-face events, and online interaction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|title=The Why and How of Science Communication|last=Bultitude|first=Karen|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813110819/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/bultitude/KB_TB/Karen_Bultitude_-_Science_Communication_Why_and_How.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[journalism]] (for example, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[television]] and [[radio]]) has the advantage of reaching large audiences; in the past, this is way most people regularly accessed information about science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media is also more likely to produce information that is high quality (well written or presented), as it will have been produced by professional journalists. Traditional journalism is often also responsible for setting agendas and having an impact on government [[policy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The traditional journalistic method of communication is one-way, so there can be no dialogue with the public, and science stories can often be reduced in scope so that there is a limited focus for a mainstream audience, who may not be able to comprehend the bigger picture from a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, there is new research now available on the role of newspapers and television channels in constituting 'scientific public spheres' which enable participation of a wide range of actors in public deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese.2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage of traditional journalism is that, once a science story is taken up by mainstream media, the scientist(s) involved no longer has any direct control over how his or her work is communicated, which may lead to misunderstanding or misinformation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Margaret|date=25 January 2016|title=Margaret McCartney: Who gains from the media’s misrepresentation of science?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i355|journal=BMJ|volume=352|pages=i355|doi=10.1136/bmj.i355|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26810502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area demonstrates how the relationship between journalists and scientists has been strained in some instances.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudo|first=Anthony|date=1 September 2015|title=Scientists, the Media, and the Public Communication of Science|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12298|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=9|issue=9|pages=761–775|doi=10.1111/soc4.12298|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand scientists have reported being frustrated with things like journalists oversimplifying or dramatizing of their work, while on the other hand journalists find scientists difficult to work with and ill-equipped to communicate their work to a general audience.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962750268|title=The Oxford handbook of the science of science communication|others=Jamieson, Kathleen Hall,, Kahan, Dan M.,, Scheufele, Dietram,|isbn=9780190497620|location=New York, NY, United States of America|oclc=962750268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Despite this potential tension, a comparison of scientists from several countries has shown that many scientists are pleased with their media interactions and engage often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Hans Peter|last2=Brossard|first2=Dominique|last3=Cheveigné|first3=Suzanne de|last4=Dunwoody|first4=Sharon|last5=Kallfass|first5=Monika|last6=Miller|first6=Steve|last7=Tsuchida|first7=Shoji|date=11 July 2008|title=Interactions with the Mass Media|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5886/204|journal=Science|volume=321|issue=5886|pages=204–205|doi=10.1126/science.1157780|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18625578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note the use of traditional media sources, like [[newspaper]]s and [[television]], has steadily declined as primary sources for science information, while the internet has rapidly increased in prominence.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/|title=S&amp;E Indicators 2018 {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over half of Americans (55 percent) reported using the internet as their primary source to learn about science and technology, compared to 24 percent reporting TV and 4 percent reporting newspapers were their primary sources.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Additionally, traditional media outlets have dramatically decreased the number of, or in some cases eliminated, science journalists and the amount of science-related content they publish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23674|title=Communicating Science Effectively: A Research Agenda|last=Agenda|first=Committee on the Science of Science Communication: A Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Sciences|first3=National Academies of|last4=Engineering|last5=Medicine|first5=and|date=13 December 2016|isbn=9780309451024|doi=10.17226/23674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category is live or face-to-face events, such as public lectures (for example, [http://events.ucl.ac.uk/calendar/tab:lunch_hour_lectures/ UCL's public lunch hour lectures] – [[museum]]s, [[debate]]s, [http://www.sciencemadesimple.co.uk/shows/busking science busking], [http://www.sciartcenter.org/ sci-art], [http://www.sciencecafes.org/ science cafes] and [[science festival]]s. [[Citizen science|Citizen Science]] or crowd-sourced science (scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists), which can be done with a face-to-face approach, online, or as a combination of the two to engage in science communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research has shown that members of the public seek out science information that is entertaining, but also helping citizens to critically participate in risk regulation and S&amp;T governance.&lt;ref&gt;Shiju Sam Varughese. 2017. ''Contested Knowledge: Science, Media, and Democracy in Kerala''. Oxford University Press, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is important to bear this aspect in mind when communicating scientific information to the public (for example, through events combining science communication and comedy, such as [http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/ Festival of the Spoken Nerd] or during scientific controversies).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The advantages of this approach are that it is more personal and allows scientists to interact with the public, allowing for two-way dialogue. Scientists are also better able to control content using this method. Disadvantages of this method include the limited reach, it can also be resource-intensive and costly and also, it may be that only audiences with an existing interest in science will be attracted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The third category is online interaction, for example, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s and [[podcast]]s can also be used for science communication, as can other [[social media]]. Online methods of communicating science have the potential to reach huge audiences, can allow direct interaction between scientists and the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Könneker|first=Carsten|last2=Lugger|first2=Beatrice |date=4 October 2013|title= Public Science 2.0 – Back to the Future |url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/49 |journal=Science|volume=342|issue= 6154|pages=49–50|doi= 10.1126/science.1245848|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24092719}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content is always accessible and can be somewhat controlled by the scientist. Additionally, online communication of science can help boost scientists' reputation through increased citations, better circulation of articles, and establishing new collaborations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Online communication also allows for both one-way and two-way communication, depending on the audience’s and the author's preferences. However, there are disadvantages in that it is difficult to control how content is picked up by others, and regular attention and updating is needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When considering whether or not to engage in science communication online, scientists should review what science communication research has shown to be the potential positive and negative outcomes. Online communication has given rise to movements like [[open science]], which advocates for making science more accessible. However, when engaging in communication about science online, scientists should consider not publicizing or reporting findings from their research until it has been peer-reviewed and published, as journals may not accept the work after it has been circulated under the "[[Ingelfinger rule]]".

Other considerations revolve around how scientsts will be perceived by other scientists for engaging in communication. For example, some scholars have criticized engaged, popular scholars using concepts like the [[Sagan effect]] or [[Kardashian Index]]. Despite these criticisms, many scientists are taking to communicating their work on online platforms, a sign of potentially changing norms in the field.[https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40992/title/Science-Gone-Social/]

=== The effects of Twitter and other social media on scientific communication ===
By using [[Twitter]], researchers and academics can discuss and communicate scientific topics with many types of audiences based on various points of view.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608005909/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-media-in-science_us_57c8fbcde4b07addc411f6ec|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 June 2018|title=Social Media in Science|last=Ramasubbu|first=Suren|date=12 September 2016|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that the use of Twitter can positively impact the number of times a scientific article is cited. These studies show that articles that are highly tweeted about are eleven times more likely to be highly cited than those that who few people tweeted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2012/01/15/how-could-twitter-influence-science-and-why-scientists-are-on-board/#778c777718be.|title=How Could Twitter Influence Science (And Why Scientists Are on Board)|last=Shaughnessy|first=Haydn|date=17 January 2012|website=Forbes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in studies by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], research has shed light on how Twitter has a direct link to the advances in the science community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Alison Burt, Editor in chief of Elsevier Connect and author of the article ''How to use social media for science,'' states the potential drawbacks to sharing their research on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-use-social-media-for-science|title=How to use social media for science - 3 views|last=Burt|first=Alison|date=|website=Elsevier|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimberly Collins of [[PLOS]] explains reasons how some scientists are hesitant to join Twitter.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Kimberley|last2=Shiffman|first2=David|last3=Rock|first3=Jenny|date=12 October 2016|title=How Are Scientists Using Social Media in the Workplace?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0162680|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162680|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists are hesitant to use social media outlets such as Twitter due to lack of knowledge of the platform, and inexperience with how to make meaningful posts.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Some scientists do not see the meaning in using Twitter as a platform to share their research or have the time to add the information into the accounts themselves.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

Scientists also believe that Twitter is not professional enough for them to put out information as well as receive relevant suggestions and comments back.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Scientists did give a positive to using Twitter by (28%) of the scientists who participated in the study said communicating science on Twitter can benefit because of the size and diverse audience it reaches.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; BoingBoing science editor and [[The New York Times|New York Times]] columnist [[Maggie Koerth-Baker]] commented on the importance of keeping public and private personas on social media separate in order to maintain professionalism online.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to these findings, posting academic research on a personal social media accounts could potentially send mixed messages to Twitter users.

There have been occasions where scientific outreach on Twitter has been met with positive results. In September 2017, an 8 year old bug lover was teased at her school for her passion for bugs.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/an-8-year-old-bullied-for-her-love-of-bugs-just-got-her-first-scientific-publication|title=An 8-Year-Old Bullied For Her Love of Bugs Just Got Her First Scientific Publication|last=Dean|first=Signe|work=ScienceAlert|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Entomological Society of Canada|Entomological society of Canada]] posting a tweet defending her love for bugs called #BugsR4Girls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ESC’s use of twitter was able to make a statement saying, "A young girl who loves insects is being bullied &amp; needs our support. DM your email &amp; we'll connect you! #BugsR4Girls".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2017, a study done by the [[Pew Research Center]] of Journalism and Media found that "About a quarter of social media users follow science related pages and accounts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/20/science-news-and-information-today/|title=Science News and Information Today|date=2017-09-20|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group places both more importance and comparatively more trust on science news that comes to them through social media".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Karen Peterson, director of Scientific Career Development at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson Cancer research Center]] stresses the "importance of using social networks such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter to engage in intercommunication" for establishing an online presence as well.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/features/2014/02/scientists-guide-social-media|title=A scientist's guide to social media|date=14 November 2017|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is necessary for career development. No matter your personality type, career advisors recommend that postdocs use online networking tools to make connections, exchange scientific ideas, and advance a career.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

According to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], "more than 3,000 scientists and engineers told Nature about their awareness of various giant social media networks and research-profiling sites".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Elena Milani created the SciHashtag project which is a condensed collection of Twitter hashtags regarding science communication and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sagepus.blogspot.com/2016/10/scihashtag-twitter-hashtag-science.html|title=SciHashtag: Twitter hashtags for scientists|last=Underst|first=Public|last2=Science|first2=ing of|website=Public Understanding of Science Blog|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has become a part of researchers’ lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== The public understanding of science movement ==
The [[public understanding of science]], public awareness of science and public engagement with science and technology are all terms coined with a movement involving governments and societies in the late 20th century. During the late 19th century, science became a professional subject and influenced by governmental suggestions. Prior to this, public understanding of science was very low on the agenda. However, some well-known figures such as [[Michael Faraday]] ran lectures aimed at the non-expert public, his being the famous [[Christmas Lectures]] which began in 1825. The 20th century saw groups founded on the basis they could position science in a broader cultural context and allow scientists to communicate their knowledge in a way that could reach and be understood by the general public. In the UK, ''The Bodmer Report'' (or ''The Public Understanding of Science'' as it is more formally known) published in 1985 by [[The Royal Society]] changed the way scientists communicated their work to the public. The report was designed to "review the nature and extent of the public understanding of science in the United Kingdom and its adequacy for an advanced democracy.".&lt;ref name=gregory2000&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in Public|last=Gregory|first=Jane|last2=Miller|first2=Steven|publisher=Ingram Digital|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=5–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by the geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer alongside famous scientists such as broadcaster [[Sir David Attenborough]], the report was evidenced by all of the major sectors concerned; [[scientists]], [[politicians]], [[journalists]] and [[industrialists]] but not the [[Public|general public]].&lt;ref name=gregory2000/&gt; One of the main assumptions drawn from the report was everybody should have some grasp of science and this should be introduced from a young age by teachers who are suitably qualified in the subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Short|first=Daniel|year=2013|title=The public understanding of science: 30 years of the Bodmer Report|journal=The School Science Review|volume=95|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also asked for further [[media coverage]] of science including via [[newspapers]] and [[television]] which has ultimately led to the establishment of platforms such as the [[Vega Science Trust]].

In both the UK and the [[United States]] following the [[second world war]], public views of scientists swayed from great praise to resentment. Therefore, the Bodmer Report highlighted concerns from the scientific community that their withdrawal from society was causing [[scientific research]] funding to be weak.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|title=Public Attitudes to Science 2011|last=Ipsos-MORI|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050636/https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/sri-pas-2011-main-report.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmer promoted the communication of science to a wider more general public by expressing to British scientists that it was their responsibility to publicise their research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An upshot of the publication of the report was the creation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), a collaboration between the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Institution]]. The engagement between these individual societies caused the necessity for a public understanding of science movement to be taken seriously. COPUS also awarded grants for specific outreach activities allowing the public understanding to come to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodmer|first=Walter|date=20 September 2010|title=Public Understanding of Science: The BA, the Royal Society and COPUS|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/64/Suppl_1/S151|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=64|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S151–S161|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0035|issn=0035-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately leading to a cultural shift in the way scientists publicised their work to the wider non-expert community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=Science and Technology; Third Review|last=|first=|date=|website=parliament.uk|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although COPUS no longer exists within the UK the name has been adopted in the US by the [[Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science|Coalition for the Public Understanding of Science]]. An organisation which is funded by the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] and focuses on popular science projects such as science cafes, festivals, magazines and [[citizen science]] schemes.

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

==Science in Brazil==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Nathan Sivin
|url=http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/new/sivin_new_sts.htm
|title=Think Ahead
|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

==Science in India==

{{Main|Science and technology in India}}

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Scientific temper''' is a way of life (defined in this context as an individual and social process of thinking and acting) which uses the [[scientific method]] and which may, consequently, include questioning, [[observation|observing]] [[physical body|physical]] [[reality]], [[experiment|testing]], [[hypothesis|hypothesizing]], analysing, and communicating (not necessarily in that order). "Scientific temper" describes an attitude which involves the application of [[logic]]. Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/09/22/stories/2005092200211700.htm|title=Scientific temper and the argumentative Indian |publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-09-25|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the first to use the phrase in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahanti|first1=Subodh|title=A Perspective on Scientific Temper in India|journal=Journal of Scientific Temper|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–62|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/article/view/1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave a descriptive explanation:
{{quote|"[What is needed] is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for [[truth]] and new [[knowledge]], the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived [[theory]], the hard discipline of the mind—all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems."&amp;nbsp;—[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1946) ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', p. 512}}

Nehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, [[aesthetics|beauty]], goodness and truth. Nehru also contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied "to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation." While religion tends to close the mind and produce "[[Social tolerance|intolerance]], [[credulity]] and [[superstition]], emotionalism and irrationalism", and "a temper of a dependent, unfree person", a scientific temper "is the temper of a [[freedom|free]] man". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of [[religion]], and "the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jawaharlal |last=1Nehru |title=The Discovery of India |edition= Centenary |publisher=Oxford: University Press |year=1989 |page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru states (that) "It is science alone that can solve the problems of [[malnutrition|hunger]] and [[poverty in India|poverty]], of insanitation and [[literacy in India|illiteracy]], of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kar|first1=Devi|title=THE NEED TO FOSTER A SCIENTIFIC TEMPER|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120821/jsp/opinion/story_15874879.jsp#.VJeYScFcBg|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by [[Charles Darwin]] when he said, "[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=Darwin Correspondence Project|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-12757|work=Darwin, C. R. to Aveling, E. B. 13 Oct 1880|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Karl Marx]] when he said, "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions."

"To develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform" is one of the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India|fundamental duties]] of the people of the [[Republic of India]], according to the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book| title = Introduction to the Constitution of India| last = Basu| first = Durga Das| year = 1993| edition = 15th| place = New Delhi| publisher = [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall of India]]| isbn = 81-203-0839-5| page = 131| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of India]], through the National Council for Science and Technology Communication, dedicated the 28 February [[National Science Day]] of 2014 to the theme "Fostering Scientific Temper" to spread Nehru's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keshavamurthy|first1=H.R.|title=Fostering Scientific Temper is Fundamental to Innovation and Progress|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=104309|publisher=Press Information Bureau, India|accessdate=22 December 2014|date=27 February 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources]] launched the scholarly serial ''Journal of Scientific Temper'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Journal of Scientific Temper''|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/index|publisher=NISCAIR, India|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===
The Russian economist Kondratiev&lt;ref&gt;Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to the book was positive. [[Jane Brody|Jane E. Brody]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "a fast-moving, informative and thoroughly enjoyable chronicle, with amusing anecdotes, legends and interesting sidelights that reflect the personalities, lives and times of the men who shaped our nation scientifically." She noted that "the authors have kept their writing free of chauvinism," and that "[m]ost of the scientific concepts are well enough explained so that even the newcomer to science should be able to grasp at least the essence of them."&lt;ref&gt;"Science For Teen-Agers," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue the book was included among seventy-five recommended titles selected by the Children's Editor of the newspaper's Book Review, described as an "[i]nformative, thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of the development of science in our country."&lt;ref&gt;"Seventy-Five Recommended Titles," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR233.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers' Weekly]]'' stated that "[t]o read the index ... is to read the names of the men and of their discoveries in science in America, from the earliest days ... to the space age. To read the book is to become familiar with the men and their contributions to science."&lt;ref&gt;"Other Science Topics," ''Publishers' Weekly'', November 13, 1967, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Basalia, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', called the book "a first-rate history of American science and technology for high-school students ... cover[ing] major American technical discoveries as well as our contributions to the purely theoretical aspects of science." He found "much to be praised ... the book is intelligently conceived, carefully organized, clearly written, and handsomely designed. Unfortunately, the illustrations do not do justice to [the] excellent text."&lt;ref&gt;"De CAMP, L. Sprague &amp; Catherine C. De Camp. ''The Story of Science in America''," ''Library Journal'', December 15, 1967, p. 4620.&lt;/ref&gt;

H. D. Allen in the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' wrote that the book's story "makes fascinating reading," and that "[w]hile the treatment of any one discipline may at first seem superficial and chatty, the total impact is most impressive, for the reader is left with an acquaintance with the leading figures of the age of science and some appreciation of how the contribution of each influenced a way of life." He concluded "The breadth of scientific knowledge which this book represents is remarkable, as is the skill with which it has been set down and the effortlessness with which it reads."&lt;ref&gt;"Books: Roster Of Science," ''Montreal Gazette'', January 27, 1968, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'' called it "[a] wide-ranging survey [that] reflects the authors' humanistic interests as well as their familiarity with several branches of science and their extensive background reading."&lt;ref&gt;"Books for young adults," ''The Booklist'', February 15, 1968, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hal Clement|Harry C. Stubbs]] in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' included it among "half a dozen books dealing ... with the history of science [that] I can recommend [both] to nonscientists as guides toward the Light [and] to scientists and science teachers as reminders that what we know was long, slow, and hard in coming." He noted that it "give[s] us a series of fascinating biographical and anecdotal items strung loosely on the thread of developing scientific knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;"Views on Science Books," ''The Horn Book Magazine'', February 1968, pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Morrison|Philip]] and Phylis Morrison in ''[[Scientific American]]'' felt it "manages to convey a sense of coherence, even though it deals at staccato length with so many men, trends and ideas ... The reason is partly in the expert writing--smooth, unusually candid, cheerful and sometimes a bit condescending (as in the two or three pages about Veblen)." They add that "[n]ot all the dicta of the authors seem reasonable, but to find any personal judgment at work is so rare in this kind of pedagogy that one is pleased by the De Camps even when one disagrees with them."&lt;ref&gt;"A Christmas selection of books on science for younger readers," ''Scientific American'', December 1968, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[Randall Munroe]] in which the author answers [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] science [[question]]s sent to him by readers of his [[webcomic]], ''[[xkcd]]''. The book contains a selection{{refn|group=Note|Munroe answers more than 50 questions in the ''What If?'' book.}} of questions and answers originally published on his [[blog]] ''What If?'', along with several new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randall|first1=Munroe|title=What if I wrote a book?|url=http://blog.xkcd.com/2014/03/12/what-if-i-wrote-a-book/|website=blog.xkcd.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406133759/http://blog.xkcd.com/2014/03/12/what-if-i-wrote-a-book/|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into several dozen chapters, most of which are devoted to answering a unique question.{{refn|name=:0|group=Note|Periodic sections labeled "Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox" are typically composed of multiple questions.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;}} ''What If?'' was released in September 2, 2014 and was received positively by critics.

== Conception of the blog ==
In the introduction section of the book, Randall Munroe recounts wondering as a child whether "there were more hard things or soft things in the world", concluding that "the world contained about three billion soft things and five billion hard things". The conversation that was produced by this question impressed Munroe's mother to such a degree that she wrote it down. Though Munroe later stated that his question was rather meaningless, he used it as an example of how "thoroughly answer[ing] a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd-explains-complexity-through-absurdity.html?_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=He’s Glad You Asked|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=2014-11-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108165503/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd-explains-complexity-through-absurdity.html?_r=0|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Munroe has been answering unusual questions sent in by readers of ''xkcd'' on his blog ''What If?''. The concept was inspired by a weekend program organized by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in which volunteers can teach classes to groups of high school students on any chosen subject. Munroe signed up after hearing about it from a friend and decided to teach a class on [[energy]]. Though the lecture felt "dry" at first, once Munroe started bringing up examples from ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the students became more excited. The entire second half of the class was eventually spent solving mathematical and physics problems. Munroe wrote the first entries a few years before the start of the blog, based on questions he was asked that day.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/a-conversation-with-randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd/262851/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|title=A Conversation With Randall Munroe, the Creator of XKCD|last=Garber|first=Megan|date=2012-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134047/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/a-conversation-with-randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd/262851/|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was delayed in getting the website online, Munroe had a lot of time thinking about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an [[infinite scrolling]] page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a [[scientific paper]], he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.&lt;ref name=Atlantic /&gt;

== Production ==
Munroe announced in March, 2014 that he had signed a deal with publisher [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] to compile a large number of his ''What If?'' entries into a book. ''What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions'' would eventually be released in September that year.&lt;ref name=WallStreet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/20/seven-lessons-from-the-xkcd-what-if-comic-strip/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|title=Seven Lessons From the XKCD 'What If' Comic Strip|last=Ballard|first=Ed|date=2014-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134135/https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/20/seven-lessons-from-the-xkcd-what-if-comic-strip/|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''What If?'' book contains a selection of questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. [[Alt text]], which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added [[footnotes]] to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader.&lt;ref name=Escapist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/features/12215-Review-Randall-Munroe-s-What-If-Delivers-New-Chapters-Solid-Scie|publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''|title=Review: What If?

''What If?'' is Munroe's second published book, his first being ''XKCD: Volume 0'', a curated collection of ''xkcd'' comics released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/11/xkcd-book.html|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|title='XKCD: Volume 0' is sticking it to traditional publishers|last=Milian|first=Mark|date=2009-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914194232/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/11/xkcd-book.html|archivedate=2015-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munroe released a third book, titled ''Thing Explainer'', in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/thing-explainer-fun-if-you-enjoy-puzzles-annoying-if-you-just-want-to-learn/|publisher=''[[CNET]]''|title='Thing Explainer': Fun if you enjoy puzzles, annoying if you just want to learn|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|date=2015-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606195051/http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/thing-explainer-fun-if-you-enjoy-puzzles-annoying-if-you-just-want-to-learn/|archive-date=2016-06-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What If?'' is mainly composed of answers Munroe gives to readers' hypothetical questions on various scientific topics. The questions tend to be rather unusual, assuming an improbable scenario and inquiring a logical conclusion to the situation. The first question Munroe answered for the blog was the following:&lt;ref name=WallStreet /&gt;

{{quote|What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the [[speed of light]]?|''What If?''}}

Using mathematics and physics, Munroe concluded such a situation would result in a large explosion. ''What If?'' approaches its subject matter with a sense of wit and sometimes makes use of approximations to answer questions that seem impossible to solve.&lt;ref name=WallStreet /&gt; Most questions demand assumptions and cross-disciplinary science skills to answer, resulting in [[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|"back-of-the-envelope" calculations]].&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost /&gt; ''What If?'' is interspersed with "charmingly-amateur" [[stick figure]] illustrations.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe /&gt;

The book also features periodic sections titled "Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox", which are short collections of questions Munroe had not answered because he did not "want to think about that". In an interview, Munroe stated that he "never got past the initial mental image" of the question "How cold would your teeth have to get in order for a cup of hot coffee to make them shatter on contact?"&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|title='What If' There Were An Entire Book Devoted To Absurd Hypotheticals?|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/09/07/346082579/what-if-there-were-an-entire-book-devoted-to-absurd-hypotheticals|work=[[National Public Radio]]|agency=NPR staff|date=2014-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406133849/http://www.npr.org/2014/09/07/346082579/what-if-there-were-an-entire-book-devoted-to-absurd-hypotheticals|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The book was received positively by critics. Ethan Gilsdorf of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' stated that "it’s fun to watch as Munroe tackles each question and examines every possible complication." According to Gilsdorf, ''What If?'' gives a view into "Munroe’s playful yet existentially-tinged worldview" by contrasting cataclysmic scenarios with more heady ideas, such as examining the effects of a magnitude minus-7 [[Richter scale]] [[earthquake]].&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilsdorf|first1=Ethan|title=‘What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions’ by Randall Munroe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/09/07/book-review-what-serious-scientific-answers-absurd-hypothetical-questions-randall-munroe/VBiNvWJcWiIZKKQyoBDCVI/story.html|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134307/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/09/07/book-review-what-serious-scientific-answers-absurd-hypothetical-questions-randall-munroe/VBiNvWJcWiIZKKQyoBDCVI/story.html|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' remarked that "What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even the weirdest question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humor."&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gleick|first1=Peter|authorlink1=Peter Gleick|title='What If? - A Review of Randall Munroe's New Book|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/what-if-a-review-of-randa_b_5744680.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2014-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134212/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/what-if-a-review-of-randa_b_5744680.html|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhett Allain of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' praised ''What If?'' because even his 12-year-old son was able to enjoy it, though he found a minor error in one of the sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allain|first1=Rhett|title=Book Review: What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/book-review-serious-scientific-answers-absurd-hypothetical-questions/|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=2014-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134401/http://www.wired.com/2014/12/book-review-serious-scientific-answers-absurd-hypothetical-questions/|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Hewitt of ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' and Marla Desat of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' noted that the first print run had some issues processing [[mathematical symbols]], as a square box was displayed where a [[delta (letter)|delta]] is supposed to be printed.&lt;ref name=Escapist /&gt;&lt;ref name=Varsity /&gt;

The comic strip is a [[Text comics|text-based comic]], that answers readers' questions, with illustrations of the main characters, various objects, and, or the experiments being discussed. It is run as a single panel comic that appears in newspapers as a color, or black and white Sunday feature, in either a 1/4 page strip, or 1/2 tab format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://images.amuniversal.com/ups/sales/UPS_Factsheet6_06.pdf|title=Universal Press Syndicate: Fact Sheet, June 2006 |publisher=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]|pages=2, 3|date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic has reached a readership of 52 million readers, in 13 countries.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; About 80 percent of the letters it receives are from females.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; From its comic origins, its lead character Beakman would later star in his own [[live action]] [[television series]], ''[[Beakman's World]]''.&lt;ref name="Post2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/20/DI2006062000567.html|title=Comics: Meet the Artist|first=Suzanne |last=Tobin|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic also branched out into other media, gaining numerous awards along the way. The comic continued for several months after its author died of a heart attack on April 29, 2016.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jok-Church-Beakman-and-Jax-cartoon-strip-for-7396400.php|title=Jok Church, of Beakman and Jax cartoon strip for kids, dies at 67|author=Steve Rubenstein|date=5 May 2016|work=SFGate|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jok's final remaining comic was published on July 17, 2016, just three days after its 25th anniversary of publication.&lt;ref name=GoComics/&gt;

The comic strip was originally named ''You Can with Beakman'' (also called ''U Can with Beakman''.&lt;ref name="BrnLW"/&gt; Its only main character at the time was '''Beakman Place''', a male figure with spiky blue hair, glasses, a neck tie, and a breast pocket full of instruments. Beakman is a non-[[scientist]] that learns about the world through books, and then finds ways to prove what he's read about.&lt;ref name=ADE&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn86033360/1994-05-10/ed-1/seq-10/png/ |title=National News: Cartoonist defends 'explosive' comic strip experiment|work=Adirondack Daily Enterprise|publisher=Northern New York Library Network Newspaper.com |date=1994-05-10 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after [[Beekman Place]], a small street on the east side of Manhattan, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Real Breakman, by Brenden Shea|work=Odyssey. March 2000, Vol. 9 Issue 3, page 45|publisher=[[Odyssey (children's magazine)]] |date=March 2000|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic is in a question-and-answer format, in which a reader asks a question, addressed to either Beakman, or also later, his sister '''Jax Place''',&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amzn&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0836270215|title=Beakman and Jax's Microscope Book: Product description|publisher=Amazon.com|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a red head, with her hair curled up behind her head in blue circular bands, she wears glasses, and [[Knucklebones|jacks]] in her hair, and as [[earring]]s.

A paragraph after the results of the experiment, in inverted text at the bottom of the comic, would explain the answer.

==Concept==
The idea for doing a comic strip came to Jok while he was working for [[Lucasfilm]], and answering questions from [[George Lucas]]' [[fan mail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|title=Beakman's World: Museum hosts hands-on show|first=Connie|last=Yeager|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]]|date=1998-03-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906044215/http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|archivedate=2004-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that he was “overcome by the bravery children showed by asking Mr. Lucas anything at all" and he "decided to write about real questions from real kids".&lt;ref name=SFBay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445 |title=Introducing Jok Church’s Comic - You Can with Beakman &amp; Jax|first=Tom W.|last=Kelly|work=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]|publisher=sfbaytimes.com|archivedate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132457/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[Lucasfilm]], Jok began working on a project called "Here's How" a comicstrip and educational television series featuring [[C-3PO]] teaching foreign language and [[R2-D2]] explaining the more physical world", the idea was eventually shelved, but the concept later evolved into Jok's Comicstrip featuring a character named Beakman.&lt;ref name="AMU"/&gt; He would receive these science questions from children, and he would choose to answer them based on subjects that he didn't know about, and wanted to learn.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; The comic was written for an audience that includes children, but not exclusively children.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; He felt his purpose in making the comics was "to make sure my readers are not intimidated by the world through which they walk".&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; He would then research the subject, write, draw, and color the comics by using a Macintosh computer.&lt;ref name=UCan1&gt;{{cite book | last = Church | first = Jok  | title = You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do  | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 1992 | page = 4 | isbn = 0836270045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process gained him criticism in May 1994 when he explained how to do an experiment separating [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] from water, through [[electrolysis]] using a single jar, and a [[nine-volt battery]], for which he defended the comic strip, by explaining the small amount of gas that would be produced in this way would not be overly dangerous. This was reported to be the first time an experiment's safety was questioned.&lt;ref name=ADE/&gt;

Besides answering questions from children, Jok also took questions from adults. One such question came from the Canadian Prime Minister, [[Jean Chrétien]], who asked about why golf balls had little dents. Jok later explained that he "has world leaders periodically contribute to his&amp;nbsp;... feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndicates/News Services: Prime minister asks.|work=Editor &amp; Publisher |volume= 127 |issue=40|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |date=1994-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comic strip Jok also introduced an annual "Beakman and Jax Make Up Your Own Rules Contest", in which the reader could report on an experiment or research they did. There were up to 100 winners from around the world, and the prizes were such things as a free telescopes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life: Your Family, Melissa Baird|work=Marysville/Yuba City's Appeal-Democrat November 12, 1995, page C4|publisher=[[Appeal-Democrat]] |date=1995-10-12 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the Beakman &amp; Jax books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briefs: Cedar Rapids, Student wins book|work=The Cedar Rapids Gazette: Thursday, Nov. 10,1994, Page 3Y|publisher=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]] |date=1994-11-10 |page=3Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and media==
The comic first appeared in the [[Marin Independent Journal]], and was offered to them for free.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; The earlier comic strips were then reprinted in three "Science Stuff You Can Do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/search?q=Science+Stuff+You+Can+Do |title=Science Stuff You Can Do, Search on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; books, a ''Best of'', and was the bases for two specialty books, ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Bubble Book'' and ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Microscope Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2697013W/The_Best_of_You_Can_With_Beakman_and_Jax |title=The Best of You Can With Beakman and Jax, on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the release of the first book June 1, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780836270044 |title=You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do, publication information. |publisher=[[American Booksellers Association]]

"Sound Barrier, Beak-mania and Healthy Living" |newspaper=[[TV.com]]|date=1995-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 an official website opened for the strip published by the "North Bay Network", it won many awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID3542/res/encat/102981.htm |title=You can with Beakman and Jax |publisher=[[Indiana University]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later moved to its current location in 1996, published by [[Network Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoismind.com/whois/beakman.com.html |title=Beakman.com - Whois Data |publisher=[[Whois]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it has received several positive reviews from such internet guides as "The parents' pocket guide to kids &amp; computers" by Family Computer Workshop, which gave the site 5 out of 5 stars and recommended it for readers 7–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Parents' Pocket Guide to Kids &amp; Computers |authors=Family Computer Workshop Staff| publisher = Family Computer Workshop | year = 1998 | page = 166 | isbn = 0966645634}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the site contained questions and answers, as well as hands-on activities, some of which required [[Netscape]] and [[Shockwave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Elizabeth B. | last = Miller | title = The Internet Resource Directory for K–12 Teachers and Librarians | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2001 | page = 174 | isbn = 1563089130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final strip was published on July 17, 2016, three days after its 25th anniversary and three months after Jok Church died.
