'''Africa''' is the world's second largest and second most-populous [[continent]] (behind [[Asia]] in both categories). At about 30.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11.7 million square&amp;nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of [[Earth|Earth's]] total surface area and 20% of its land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley (1999), ''Africa'', Twenty-First Century Books. {{ISBN|0-7613-1367-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With
{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Africa}}|R}}/1e9 round 1}} billion people{{UN_Population|ref}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}, it accounts for about 16% of the world's [[human population]]. The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The continent includes [[Madagascar]] and various [[archipelagos]]. It contains 54 [[diplomatic recognition|fully recognised]] [[sovereign states]] ([[country|countries]]), nine [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and two ''[[de facto]]'' independent [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited or no recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa]].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the continent and its countries are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], with a substantial portion and number of countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Africa hosts a large diversity of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|ethnicities]], cultures and [[Languages of Africa|languages]]. In the [[New Imperialism|late 19th century]], European countries [[Scramble for Africa|colonised almost all of Africa]]; most present states in Africa originated from a process of [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the [[African Union]], which is headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Palazzo Ferreria statue 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue representing Africa at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the [[Nile]] river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich |encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch |date=1913–1918 |location=Hannover|edition=8th |url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015 |language=German|title=Afri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name seems to have originally referred to a [[Ancient Libya|native Libyan]] tribe, an ancestor of modern [[Berbers]]; see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''{{lang|phn|ʿafar}}'' meaning "dust",&lt;ref&gt;Venter &amp; Neuland, ''NEPAD and the African Renaissance'' (2005), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] word ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name="Michell"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, "The Berbers"], ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161–94.&lt;/ref&gt; The same word&lt;ref name=Michell/&gt; may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a Berber tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. {{ISBN|90-429-1344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, [[Carthage]] became the capital of the province it then named ''[[Africa Proconsularis]]'', following its defeat of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix ''[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]'' can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim region of [[Ifriqiya]], following its conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] Empire's ''[[Exarchate of Africa|Exarchatus Africae]]'', also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in his 7th-century ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title=Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed&lt;ref&gt;in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221–38.&lt;/ref&gt; linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East." Robert R. Stieglitz. ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (September 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ibn Khallikan]] and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarite]] king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called "Afrikus son of Abrahah" who subdued Ifriqiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cdLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|title=Kitab Wafayat Ala'yan.

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;million years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C.

After the evolution of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan van Sertima|van Sertima, Ivan]].

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Candice Goucher|author2=Linda Walton|title=World History: Journeys from Past to Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7cAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-72354-6|pages=2–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the [[Sahara]] has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Keenan|title=The Sahara: Past, Present and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUKPAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ice age]]s, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[Saharan rock art|rock art paintings]] depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] dating back perhaps 10 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercier|first1=Norbert|author2=et. al.|date=2012|title=OSL dating of quaternary deposits associated with the parietal art of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau (Central Sahara)|journal=Quaternary Geochronology|volume=10|pages=367–73|doi=10.1016/j.quageo.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht "Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060153/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht |date=2014-03-07 }}, ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, "Africa, 3rd Ed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011083356/http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm |date=2007-10-11 }} Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first [[Roman emperor]] native to North Africa was [[Septimius Severus]], born in [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was [[Punics|Punic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New exhibition about Roman Emperor Septimius Severus at the Yorkshire Museum|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/features/8826893.New_exhibition_about_Roman_Emperor_Septimius_Severus_at_the_Yorkshire_Museum/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Press|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]].

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift.

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt;was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|isbn=978-2-87747-563-1|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]] followed suit the next year (March 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Aryeetey|author2=Jane Harrigan|author3=Machiko Nissanke|title=Economic Reforms in Ghana: The Miracle and the Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87V55ZHppSYC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-844-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===

Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human migration|Migration]] from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At Least a Million Sub-Saharan Africans Moved to Europe Since 2010 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Plate is a major [[tectonic plate]] straddling the [[equator]] as well as the [[prime meridian]]. It includes much of the [[continent]] of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between {{Mya|60}} and {{Mya|10}}, the [[Somali Plate]] began [[rift (geology)|rifting]] from the African Plate along the [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropic ecozone]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html "Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193432/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html |date=2012-01-05 }} [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}
[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Mauritius beach.png|thumb|Tropical beach in [[Trou-aux-Biches]], [[Mauritius]]]]
Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and [[arable land]]. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"/&gt;

[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level – UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206051452/http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 |date=December 6, 2008 }}.

==Politics==
{{See also|List of political parties in Africa by country}}
There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

=== The African Union ===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Member states of the African Union&lt;!--no suspended states--&gt;]]

{{Main|African Union}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm |title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki |author=Thabo Mbeki |date=9 July 2002 |publisher=africa-union.org |location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa |accessdate=8 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210549/http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_%26_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union%2C%209%20July%202002.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/|title=Human Development Reports – United Nations Development Programme|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in Africa|Poverty]], illiteracy, [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of [[Poverty in Africa|the population living in poverty]] in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people).

Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries.  The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC).  The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa.  About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into dept.  A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia’s looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In a recently published analysis based on [[World Values Survey]] data, the Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] maintained that several African countries, most notably [[Ghana]], perform quite well on scales of mass support for [[democracy]] and the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3214715 |ssrn=3214715|title=Africa on the Maps of Global Values: Comparative Analyses, Based on Recent World Values Survey Data|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2018-07-16|last1=Tausch|first1=Arno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch's global value comparison based on the [[World Values Survey]] derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded “is really amazing”. While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in [[Ghana]], the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], and especially for Africa's leading economy, [[South Africa]]. High [[Human Inequality]], as measured by the [[UNDP]]’s [[Human Development Report]]’s [[Index of Human Inequality]], further impairs the development of [[Human Security]]. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and [[human rights]] data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a [[civil society]].

In recent years, the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 Malia Politzer, "China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration"], ''Migration Information Source''.

A Harvard University study led by professor [[Calestous Juma]] showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124337.htm "Africa Can Feed Itself in a Generation, Experts Say"], ''[[Science Daily]]'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

[[File:Kobli1.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from [[Benin]]]]
Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overpopulation.org/Africa.html|title=Africa Population Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx Past and future population of Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924044751/http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx |date=2015-09-24 }}.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and [[southeast Africa]]. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[the Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''. PUQ. p. 204. {{ISBN|2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ("[[Bushmen|San"]] or "Bushmen") and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

Prior to the [[decolonization]] movements of the post-[[World War II]] era, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] were represented in every part of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country" (3 of 10)]. ''Time'', 5 November 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million ''[[pieds-noir]]s'' in North Africa),&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994).

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name="Africa"/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, "Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce"], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Africa |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602050234/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D8048%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate= 2 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps the largest in the world.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoisan Languages|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Khoisan.html|website=The Language Gulper|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, English and French (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. German is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former German protectorate.

Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"&gt;[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf Pearsonhighered.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070358/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/&gt;

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[architecture of Africa|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known [[bead]]s were made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology'' (2013, {{ISBN|0191626147}}), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Africa}}
[[File:Ke-Nako Music-Performance Vienna2008c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A musician from [[South Africa]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab world|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
[[File:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Fifty-four African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

At {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=off}}, it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].

Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, [[protist]]a, and certain [[animal]]s, such as [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s. Vegetation, where it occurs, is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered, unseen until 1820 when the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' sighted the [[Fimbul ice shelf]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

Antarctica is a ''de facto'' [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] that have consulting status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.

==Etymology==
[[File:Adelie Penguins on iceberg.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguins]] in Antarctica]]
The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanised]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ἀνταρκτική (''antarktiké''), feminine of [[wikt:ἀνταρκτικός|ἀνταρκτικός]] (''antarktikós''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |editor-last=Crane |editor-first=Gregory R. |contribution=Antarktikos |title=A Greek–English Lexicon |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hince |first=Bernadette |date=2000 |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=978-0-9577471-1-1 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his book ''Meteorology'' about an ''Antarctic region'' in c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorologica.] Book II, Part 5. 350 BCE. Translated by E. Webster. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923. 140 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marinus of Tyre]] reportedly used the name in his unpreserved world map from the 2nd century CE.  The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] and [[Apuleius]] (1–2 centuries CE) used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name ''polus antarcticus,''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlWM1eMefB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage De astronomia.] Ed. G. Viré. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1992. 176 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apuleii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage Opera omnia.] Volumen tertium. London: Valpy, 1825. 544 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; from which derived the [[Old French]] ''pole antartike'' (modern ''pôle antarctique'') attested in 1270, and from there the [[Middle English]] ''pol antartik'' in a 1391 technical treatise by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (modern ''Antarctic Pole'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer. [http://art-bin.com/art/oastro.html A Treatise on the Astrolabe.] Approx. 1391. Ed. W. Skeat. London: N. Trübner, 1872. 188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called "[[France Antarctique]]".

The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name==
The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.

Then in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name ''Australia'' from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. During that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as Ultima and Antipodea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''Antarctica'' was adopted in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodburn |first1=Susan |title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica |journal=Cairt |date=July 2008 |issue=13 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no indigenous population, and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, in February 1775, during his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]], [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, belief in the existence of a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]—had prevailed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century AD. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy'']]

Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''—this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:

{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, Matthew.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it retains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

Positioned asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. There are a number of rivers and lakes in Antarctica, the longest river being the [[Onyx River|Onyx]]. The largest lake, [[Lake Vostok|Vostok]], is one of the largest sub-glacial lakes in the world. Antarctica covers more than {{convert|14|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; and is mostly characterised by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation coloured by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204205054/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]], the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the small possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geologic time scale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]]: see [[ice-sheet dynamics]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land|&lt;abbr title="Macpherson"&gt;Mac&lt;/abbr&gt;. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on [[Ross Island]] is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent, and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081129/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385|title=Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.&lt;ref name="Briggs2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=19 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm|title=Secret rivers found in Antarctic|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

===Geological history and palaeontology===
More than 170&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

====Palaeozoic era (540–250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&amp;nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&amp;nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-98665-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)====
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206–146&amp;nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146–66&amp;nbsp;Ma), though [[Nothofagus|southern beech]] became more prominent towards the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Glacialisaurus]]'', from the [[Hanson Formation]],&lt;ref name="SmithPol2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nathan D.|last2=Pol|first2=Diego|date=2007|title=Anatomy of a basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of Antarctica|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–674|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-657.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie, Mitch |title=The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080130062646/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |archivedate=30 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up.

However, there is some evidence of antarctic marine glaciation during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Bornemann, Norris RD, Friedrich O, Beckmann B, Schouten S, Damsté JS, Vogel J, Hofmann P, Wagner T., Isotopic evidence for glaciation during the Cretaceous supergreenhouse.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gondwana breakup (160–23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160&amp;nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125&amp;nbsp;Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reinhold, Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=Antarctica yields first land mammal fossil|journal=New York Times|date=21 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eocene]] epoch, about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.  During the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels have been found to be about 760 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|title=New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=26 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082838/http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.

Around 23 Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels became more important.&lt;ref name="DeContoPollard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeConto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

====Neogene Period (23–0.05 Ma)====
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Trewby|editor-first=Mary|date=September 2002|title=Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1-55297-590-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meyer Desert Formation biota====
{{main|Meyer Desert Formation biota}}
Fossil ''[[Nothofagus]]'' leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the [[Sirius Group]] show that intermittent warm periods allowed ''Nothofagus'' shrubs to cling to the [[Dominion Range]] as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late [[Pliocene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=New grounds for reassessing palaeoclimate of the Sirius Group |date=2001 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London |volume=158|pages=925–35 | doi=10.1144/0016-764901-030 | last1=Retallack | first1=G.J. | last2=Krull | first2=E.S. | last3=Bockheim | first3=J.G. | issue=6|bibcode=2001JGSoc.158..925R }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Pleistocene]] ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4164401.html |author= Stefi Weisburd |title=A forest grows in Antarctica.

===Present-day===
[[File:Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica by NASA.jpg|thumb|Glaciers and rock outcrops in Marie Byrd Land seen from NASA's [[DC-8]] aircraft]]
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by nearly all of the continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|title=Antarctica's geology|publisher=Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in partnership with the British Antarctic Survey and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=31 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122142909/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|archivedate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse" /&gt; The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002" /&gt; It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest of [[Earth]]'s continents.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|−80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|−89.2|C|F|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. [[Sunburn]] is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="BAS-weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt;

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun&amp;nbsp;– Aphelion and Perihelion]. Geography.about.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name="BAS-weather" /&gt;

Several governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a [[population density]] between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]]—[[Trinity Church (Antarctica)|Trinity Church]], opened in 2004 at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Station]]—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/flock_antarcticas_orthodox_temple_celebrates_holy_trinity_day|title=Flock of Antarctica's Orthodox temple celebrates Holy Trinity Day|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavye.org.ua/index.php?action=fullinfo&amp;r_type=&amp;id=22495|script-title=ru:Владимир Петраков: 'Антарктика – это особая атмосфера, где живут очень интересные люди'|language=ru}} (Vladimir Petrakov: "Antarctic is a special world, full of very interesting people").

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-521-25274-4|oclc=473919719|pages=12, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[southern rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregate in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as [[sea cucumbers]] and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution&amp;nbsp;– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport eggs and larval stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming.&lt;ref name="basplants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge, Paul D.|author2=Spooner, Brian M.|author3=Roberts, Peter J.|date=2008|title=Non-lichenized fungi from the Antarctic region|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=106|pages=485–490|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0106/0485.htm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[endolith|cryptoendoliths]] as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to [[UV light]]. Those features can also be observed in algae and [[cyanobacteria]], suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as ''[[Cryomyces antarcticus]]'', and ''[[Cryomyces minteri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackyeast2010.bf.uni-lj.si/fileadmin/userfiles/Lectures/Onofri.pdf|title=Survival of Black Fungi in Space, Preliminary Results|author=Onofri, S.|author2=Selbmann, L.|author3=Zucconi, L.|author4=Scalzi, G.|author5=Venkateswaran, K.J.|author6=de la Torre, R.|author7=de Vera, J.-P.|author8=Ott, S.|author9=Rabbow, E.|author10=Horneck, G.|last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Hoog, G.S.|date=2005|title=Fungi of the Antarctic: evolution under extreme conditions|journal=Studies in Mycology|volume=51|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
About 298 million years ago [[Permian]] forests started to cover the continent, and [[tundra]] vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|title=Antarctica was once green: Scientists|date=15 April 2017|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062932/https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s. There are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], but only three species of [[flowering plant]]s, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass), ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native ''[[Poa annua]]'' (annual bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247414000916|title=''Poa annua'' L. in the maritime Antarctic: an overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarzyna_Chwedorzewska/publication/270217066_Poa_annua_L._in_the_maritime_Antarctic_an_overview/links/54a30c080cf267bdb9042e47.pdf|journal=Polar Record |volume =51|issue =6 |date=2015|pages=637–643|author=Chwedorzewska, K.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="basplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115623/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|archivedate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aadplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|title=Antarctic Wildlife|author=Australian Antarctic Division|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190048/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===
[[File:Blood Falls by Peter Rejcek.jpg|thumb|right|Red fluid pours out of [[Blood Falls]] at [[Taylor Glacier]]. The colour derives from [[iron oxides]].]]
Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicoloured [[snow algae]] and [[diatom]]s are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.&lt;ref name="aadplants"/&gt; Bacteria have been found living in the cold and dark as deep as {{convert|800|m|mi ft|abbr=on}} under the ice.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130206"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman|first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html|date=6 February 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
[[File:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|left|Dumping of waste, including old vehicles, such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992, is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998.]]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of [[biodiversity]] in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.&lt;ref name="BridgeHughes73"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridge|first1=Paul D.|first2=Kevin. A.|last2=Hughes|date=2010|title=Conservation issues for Antarctic fungi|journal=Mycologia Balcanica|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–76|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59687/0007/001/0073.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of [[introduced species|alien]] plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of [[krill]], which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (35,300&amp;nbsp;short tons) in 2000.&lt;ref name="KirbyBBC-2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=15 August 2001|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined [[Queen Maud Land]] as including the unclaimed area between it and the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapp|first1=Ole Magnus|title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen|journal=[[Aftenposten]]|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-8168779.html|accessdate=22 September 2015|date=21 September 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|language=no|quote=...&amp;nbsp;formålet med anneksjonen var å legge under seg det landet som til nå ligger herreløst og som ingen andre enn nordmenn har kartlagt og gransket.

Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e|title=Antarctic Treaty System – Parties|publisher=Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat|accessdate=20 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] named a previously unnamed area [[Queen Elizabeth Land]] in tribute to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foreign Secretary has announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land|work=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]], was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.&lt;ref name="BBC News: Argentine Protest Against Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina angry after Antarctic territory named after Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20822582|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby [[Falkland Islands]], and the 30th anniversary of the [[Falklands War]].

The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of the Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.&lt;ref name="peecug1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |title=La Antartica |publisher=Library.jid.org |accessdate=4 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007084832/http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peecug2"&gt;[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092226/http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

==Economy==

There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Resources|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2111.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries News|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2003/11/30/fisheries-news|publisher=mecropress|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships; 38,478 were recorded in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=2 August 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034540/http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |archivedate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=5 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iaato.org/documents/10157/1444539/2015-2016+Tourists+by+Nationality+(Total)/9a4fe29b-1c44-45cc-96b2-246e93137b2f|title=2015–2016 Tourists by Nationality Total|publisher=IAATO|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html|title=''Tourism threatens Antarctic''|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=5 February 2006|location=London|first=Mark|last=Rowe|date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[biologist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[Ice-sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen–Scott station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |title=Science in Antarctica |publisher=Antarctic Connection |accessdate=4 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207003148/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref name=adelie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|title=Adelie Penguins thriving amid Antarctica's melting ice|author=Graham, Rex|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053724/https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[The Polar Geospatial Center]] was founded.  The Polar Geospatial Center uses [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to provide mapping services to American federally funded research teams.  Currently, the Polar Geospatial Center can image all of Antarctica at 50&amp;nbsp;cm resolution every 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/polar-geospatial-center-releases-new-application-with-high-res-satelli/370342|title=Polar Geospatial Center Releases New Application with High-Res Satellite Imagery|author=Rejcek, Peter|publisher=The Antarctic Sun|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&amp;nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of the [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s. Belgian polar explorer [[Alain Hubert]] stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in [[climatology]], [[glaciology]] and [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belspo.be/belspo/bepoles/science/station/index_en.stm Belgian Science Policy Office]&amp;nbsp;– Princess Elisabeth Station&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and [[David Vaughan (glaciologist)|David Vaughan]], reported (in the journal ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'') that 2,200 years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on [[aerial survey|airborne survey]] with radar images).

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.&lt;ref name="meteorite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name="meteorite"/&gt;

In 2006 a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="crater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |title=Big Bang in Antarctica—Killer Crater Found Under Ice |publisher=Research News |first=Pam Frost |last=Gorder |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 reports emerged of a {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf#Supposed meteor crater|circular structure]], supposedly a meteorite crater, on the surface snow of [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf]]. Satellite images from 25 years ago seemingly show it.

[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|upright=1.35|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation except along the southern summer. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.&lt;ref name="United Nations Environment Programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.&lt;ref name="RignotCasassa2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.

Sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183–1189 | date = 2012-11-30 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | pages = 219–222 | date = 2018-06-13 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.&lt;ref name="landice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single 2015 study by H. Jay Zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year.&lt;ref name="ZwallyEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H.

Eric Rignot, who has worked on similar Antarctic studies, has been fielding a lot of questions about this one and shared his comments with Ars. “I am afraid I have some rather harsh words about it,” he wrote. Rignot said the data just aren’t precise enough to support the paper's conclusions.¶ “Zwally's group is the only one pushing its interpretation beyond the realm of the inherent uncertainty of the data. Accumulation of snow in East Antarctica is 10 centimeters water equivalent per year. To detect changes in accumulation of 136 gigatons (with no error bar), or 10 percent, Zwally et al. needs to detect changes of the order of 1 centimeter. Current technology such as ICESat cannot detect any change smaller than 20 centimeters. Radar altimetry (used for the earlier period) is closer to 40-50 centimeter noise, but nobody really knows. There is no way to detect changes in East Antarctic accumulation at the 10 percent level, not even 50 percent level, with those kinds of error bars,” Rignot wrote.¶ He continued, “The Zwally group’s findings are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.&lt;ref name="ShepherdWingham2007"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1136776| last1 = Shepherd | first1 = A.| last2 = Wingham | first2 = D.| title = Recent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 315| issue = 5818| pages = 1529–1532| date = 2007| pmid = 17363663|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1529S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.L.| last3 = Van Den Broeke | first3 = M R.| last4 = Davis | first4 = C.| last5 = Li | first5 = Y.| last6 = Van De Berg | first6 = W.J.| last7 = Van Meijgaard | first7 = E.| date = 2008| title = Recent Antarctic ice mass loss from radar interferometry and regional climate modelling| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 106| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232802727_Recent_Antarctic_ice_mass_loss_from_radar_interferometry_and_regional_climate_modelling|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..106R | pmc = 4032514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherdetal2012"&gt;Sheperd et al. 2012 [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance]&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.L.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = C.R.| last3 = Tapley | first3 = B.D.| last4 = Blankenship | first4 = D.| last5 = Young | first5 = D.| date = 2008| title = Antarctic regional ice loss rates from GRACE| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 266| issue = 1–2| pages = 140–148|bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.266..140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006.

==Ozone depletion==
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|Image of the largest Antarctic [[ozone hole]] ever recorded due to [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] accumulation (September 2006)]]
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

There is a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|authors=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit |publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole was detected by scientists in 1985&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792–795|accessdate=7 October 2009|issue=7257|pmid=19675624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=The Antarctic Ozone hole |authors=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) |publisher=Government of the United States |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |archivedate= 3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&amp;nbsp;°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Costello''' (born 20 February 1953) is a British paediatrician. Until 2015. Costello was Professor of International Child Health and Director of the Institute for Global Health at the [[University College London]]. Costello was most notable for his work on improving survival among mothers and their newborn infants in poor populations of developing countries.

==Life==
Costello was born in [[Beckenham]], and graduated from school at [[St Joseph's Academy, Blackheath|St Joseph's Academy]]. Costello attended [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] where he took a degree in Experimental Psychology and qualified as a doctor in Medical Sciences after clinical training at the [[Middlesex Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |title=International MNCA expert named as Director, WHO Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health |url=http://www.who.int/life-course/news/new-mca-director/en/ |website=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=8 July 2018 |location=GENEVA, SWITZERLAND |date=Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then trained in Paediatrics and Neonatology at [[University College London]].

He and his wife, Helen, have two sons, Harry and Ned, and one daughter, Freya.&lt;ref name="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honigsbaum|first1=Mark|title=Anthony Costello: making climate change part of global health|journal=The Lancet|date=16 May 2009|volume=373|issue=9676|page=1669|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60929-6|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2016}}
After living in Baglung district in western Nepal from 1984–1986, two days walk from a road, he became fascinated by challenges to mother and child health in poor, remote populations. His areas of scientific expertise include the evaluation of cost-effective interventions to reduce maternal and newborn deaths, women’s groups, strategies to tackle malnutrition, international aid and the health effects of climate change. In 1999 he published a pioneering book on how to improve newborn infant health in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;1999: Improving Newborn Infant Health in Developing Countries. Imperial and World Scientific Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

With a Nepali organisation (MIRA), that he helped to establish, a large community trial of participatory learning and action using women’s groups in the remote mountains of Makwanpur district, Nepal was published in The Lancet in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;2004: Effect of a participatory intervention with women's groups on birth outcomes in Nepal: cluster-randomised controlled trial. 2004 Lancet 364: 970–99.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish partnerships and further studies with local organisations in eastern India, Mumbai, Bangladesh and Malawi. Seven cluster randomised controlled trials of women’s groups in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Malawi, led to a meta-analysis published in the Lancet in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;2013: Women's groups practising participatory learning and action to improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings: systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet 2013 May 18;381(9879): 1736-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results showed that in populations where more than 30% of pregnant women joined the women's group programme, maternal death and newborn deaths were cut by one third. The intervention has now been recommended by the World Health Organisation for scale-up in poor, rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;2014: WHO recommendation on community mobilization through facilitated participatory learning and action cycles with women's groups for maternal and newborn health. World Health Organization; {{ISBN|978 92 4 150727 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Costello chaired the 2009 Lancet Commission on Managing the Health Effects of Climate Change,&lt;ref&gt;2009: Managing the health effects of climate change: Lancet and University College London Institute for Global Health Commission.  Lancet. 2009 May 16; 373(9676): 1693-1733.&lt;/ref&gt; and was co-chair of a new Lancet Commission which links the UK, China, Norway and Sweden on emergency actions to tackle the climate health crisis, published in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60854-6/abstract|title=Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health|first1=Nick|last1=Watts|first2=W.

At WHO he has helped to lead the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016‒2030) with its three objectives of survive, thrive and transform – to end preventable mortality, to promote health and well-being, and to expand enabling environments. Its guiding principles include equity, universality, human rights, development effectiveness and sustainability.

With the WHO team he has also launched the global accelerated action for the health of adolescents (AA-HA!) and established an expert review group called  Maternal and Newborn Information for tracking Outcomes and Results (MONITOR) to harmonize maternal and newborn health indicators.

In February 2017, together with UNICEF and UNFPA  he helped to launched the Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health to introduce evidence-based interventions to improve quality of care for maternal and newborn health supported by a learning system. The Network involves Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Malawi, Côte d'Ivoire, Uganda, Tanzania and Ghana. He also leads work on community empowerment for family health - what it means, how to measure it, and how to plan interventions at district level.

With the Lancet he is a co-chair of their new Countdown Commission on Climate Change which reports progress annually on climate change adaptation, mitigation, economics, energy policy and public engagement. With UNICEF he is helping WHO to coordinate a new Lancet Commission on redesigning child health for the Sustainable Development Goals era.

== Description ==
[[Image:Capsella bursa-pastoris Sturm23.jpg|thumb|left|rosette (a), pointed leaves, flowers (c–e), pods (i, k)]]
''C. bursa-pastoris'' plants grow from a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of lobed leaves at the base.  From the base emerges a stem about {{convert|0.2-0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, which bears a few pointed leaves which partly grasp the stem.  The flowers, which appear in any month of the year in the [[British Isles]],&lt;ref name=CTW&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clapham |first1=A.R. |last2=Tutin |first2=T.G. |last3=Warburg |first3=E.F. |date=1981 |title=Excursion Flora of the British Isles |edition=Third |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521232906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} are white and small, {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, with four petals and six stamens.&lt;ref name=CTW/&gt; They are borne in loose [[raceme]]s, and produce flattened, two-chambered seed pods known as [[siliques]], which are triangular to heart-shaped, each containing several seeds.&lt;ref name="neltje" /&gt;

Like a number of other plants in several plant families, its seeds contain a substance known as [[mucilage]], a condition known as myxospermy.&lt;ref name="western"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Plant Physiology | date = February 2000 | volume = 122 | pages = 345–355 | title = Differentiation of Mucilage Secretory Cells of the Arabidopsis Seed Coat |author1=Tamara L.

Haughn | pmc = 58872 | doi = 10.1104/pp.122.2.345 | pmid = 10677428 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptive value of myxospermy is unknown,&lt;ref name="western"/&gt; although the fact that mucilage becomes sticky when wet has led some to propose that ''C. bursa-pastoris'' traps insects which then provide nutrients to the seedling, which would make it [[Protocarnivorous plant|protocarnivorous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barber, J.T. | year = 1978 | title =  ''Capsella bursa-pastoris'' seeds: Are they "carnivorous"? | url = http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv07n2p39_42.pdf | journal = [[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 39–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Capsella bursa-pastoris'' is closely related to the [[model organism]] such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and is also used as a model organism, due to the variety of genes expressed throughout its life cycle that can be compared to genes that are well studied in ''A. thaliana''. Unlike most [[angiosperm|flowering plants]], it [[phenology|flowers]] almost all year round.&lt;ref name="neltje" /&gt;&lt;ref name="china"/&gt; Like other annual ruderals exploiting disturbed ground, ''C. bursa-pastoris'' reproduces entirely from seed, has a long [[soil seed bank]],&lt;ref name=Preston2002/&gt; and short generation time,&lt;ref name=Aksoy1998/&gt; and is capable of producing several generations each year.

==Taxonomy==
It was formally described by the Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his seminal publication '[[Species Plantarum]]' in 1753, and then published by [[Friedrich Kasimir Medikus]] in ''Pflanzen-Gattungen'' (Pfl.-Gatt.) on page 85 in 1792.&lt;ref name="Plantlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik. is an accepted name|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2697999|date=23 March 2012|publisher=theplantlist.org|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brassicaceae Capsella bursa-pastoris Medik|url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=279929-1|publisher=ipni.org|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Capsella bursa-pastoris'' subsp. ''thracicus'' (Velen.) Stoj. &amp; Stef. is the only known subspecies.&lt;ref name="Plantlist"/&gt;

[[William Coles (botanist)]] wrote in his book, 'Adam in Eden' (published in 1657), "It is called Shepherd's purse or Scrip (wallet) from the likeness of the seed hath with that kind of leathearne bag, wherein Shepherds carry their Victualls [food and drink] into the field.""&lt;ref name=Readers&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=Reader's Digest Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain |page=54 |publisher=[[Reader's Digest]] |isbn=9780276002175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In England and Scotland, it was once commonly called 'mother's heart', which is derived from a child's game/trick of picking the seed pod, which then would burst and the child would be accused of 'breaking his mother's heart'.&lt;ref name=Readers/&gt;

==Habitat==
Common on cultivated ground, waysides and meadows, disturbed land and roadworks.&lt;ref name=CTW/&gt;

== Uses ==
''C. bursa-pastoris'' is gathered from the wild,&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt; or grown.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Capsella+bursa-pastoris | title = Capsella bursa-pastoris - (L.)Medik | website = Plants For A Future database report }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has many uses, including for food,&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; to supplement animal feed,&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt; for cosmetics,&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt; and in traditional medicine.&lt;ref name="china" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web | title = Capsella bursa-pastoris (Ecocrop code 4164) | url = http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/dataSheet?id=4164 | website = ecocrop | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is cultivated as a commercial food crop in Asia.&lt;ref name="naturesrestaurant"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=David |title=Nature's Restaurant: Fields, Forests &amp; Wetlands Foods of Eastern North America - A Complete Wild Food Guide|date=March 11, 2014 |url=http://natures-restaurant-online.com/ShepherdsPurse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In Chinese, this plant is known as ''jìcài'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|荠菜}}; {{lang|zh-Hant|薺菜}}).&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Debra|title=This Chinese grandma forages and cooks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2015/05/12/this-chinese-grandma-forages-and-cooks/Aw3Nl9IUj4UpaJi4UN9feI/story.html|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=bostonglobe.com|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used in food in [[Shanghai]] and the surrounding [[Jiangnan]] region, where it is stir-fried with [[Nian gao|rice cakes]] and other ingredients or as part of the filling in [[wonton]]s.

=== Japan ===
It is one of the ingredients of the symbolic dish consumed in the Japanese spring-time festival, ''[[Nanakusa-no-sekku]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9499">The '''Countess of Dufferin Fund''' was established by [[Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava]], more commonly known as Lady Dufferin, in 1885 and was dedicated to improving women’s healthcare in [[India]].  The Fund was founded after [[Queen Victoria]] gave Lady Dufferin the task of improving healthcare for women in India.  The Fund provided scholarships for women to be educated in the medical field as doctors, hospital assistants, nurses, and [[midwives]].  It also financed the construction of female hospitals, dispensaries, and female only wards in preexisting hospitals.  The Fund marks the beginning of Western medicine for women in India and global health as a diplomatic concern.

== History of the Fund ==

=== Background ===

During the 19th century there was a major push in India to improve healthcare for women, especially maternal health.  [[Lying-in]] hospitals were built as well as training and teaching hospitals.  Many hospitals were also constructing wards for women and learning to treat female-specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;Abraham, Meera. Religion, Caste, and Gender: Missionaries and Nursing History in South India. Bangalore: B.I. Publications Pvt., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===

In 1885, Lady Dufferin set up the Fund after being contacted by Queen Victoria who gave her the task of helping the suffering women of India.  Queen Victoria had been recently contacted by [[Elizabeth Bielby]], a missionary in India who focused on women’s health.  During Beilby’s mission, she had treated the Maharani of Puna who gave her a message to relay to the Queen of England.  The message said that “the women of India suffer when they are sick.”  In response, Queen Victoria wrote back to the Maharani saying: {{quotation|“We had no idea it was as bad as this.  Something must be done for the poor creatures.  We wish it generally known that we sympathize with every effort to relieve the suffering of the women of India.”&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;}}  Lady Dufferin then started the Fund after being summoned to [[Windsor Castle]] by the Queen who gave her the task of improving healthcare and education for the women of India.&lt;ref name=Nightengale&gt;Nightingale, Florence. "The Condition of Women in India." Florence Nightingale on Social Change in India. Ed. Lynn McDonald and Gérard Vallée. Waterloo, Ont.: Wilfrid Laurier UP, 2007. 717-21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A visit from Dr. [[Mary Scharlieb]], the first female British doctor to practice in India, also mobilized the Queen to act on women’s poor health and suffering in India.  She met with Queen Victoria and expressed a similar message as the Maharni’s: the dire situation of Indian women.

=== Establishment ===

Lady Dufferin established the Fund in 1885 and immediately began creating projects and channeling money towards women’s health and teaching in India.  The Countess of Dufferin Fund is also known as “The National Association for Supplying Medical Aid to the Women of India” and the “Lady Dufferin Fund.”  This Fund marked one of the first diplomatic pushes to improve global health in the world, and the introduction of western medicine for women in India.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, Geraldine Hancock. Women in Colonial India: Essays on Politics, Medicine, and Historiography. N.p.: Orient Blackswan, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund’s goals ==

The Fund had three primary goals: providing medical tuition, medical relief, and female nurses and midwives to assist in hospitals and private homes.&lt;ref name=Billington&gt;
Billington, Mary Frances.'' Woman in India''. Delhi, India: Sri Satguru Publications, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund supplied scholarships for the medical education (medical tuition) of women in India.  The education of traditional Indian midwives, called dias, was a major goal of the Fund because many western doctors observed the dais’s practices and found their traditions to be harmful.&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;Guha, Supriya, Dr. "Midwifery in Colonial India." Welcome History. N.p., 13 Mar. 2012. Web. 15 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dais’s would massage the abdomen of the mother to speed up labor however that tradition caused [[uterine prolapse]], a widespread issue amongst Indian women at the time.  Because the dias’ methods were viewed as violent and extremely harmful, the Fund put forth money to educate them on successful ways to help women before, during, and after childbirth.  The Fund also provided medical relief by establishing dispensaries and cottage hospitals for women and children under female superintendence.&lt;ref name=Billington/&gt;  In addition, it opened female wards in existing hospitals also under female management as well as all women hospitals called [[zenana missions|zenana]] hospitals.  The Fund also supplied trained female nurses and midwives in hospitals and in private homes.

== Projects ==

The Fund financed treatment and teaching hospitals in [[Bihar]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Karachi]], [[Delhi]], [[Bombay]] and in many of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (roughly present day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand).&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt; Most notably, the Fund sponsored the [[Lady Aitchison Hospital]] in [[Lahore]], India.&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;  The Lady Aitchison Hospital, also known as the Aitchison Memorial Hospital, was a major center for training nurses and tradition midwives like the dias.  Many of the hospitals the Fund financed are still functioning today.  For example, the [[Lady Dufferin Hospital]] in Karachi is the largest solely female dedicated hospital today in Pakistan.

== Funding and Administration ==

The Fund’s major financial basis was donations.  Many saw this as a source of instability because donations were based on the popularity of Lady Dufferin and her husband as well as the favors expected by the donors in return.  The administration of the Fund consisted of a central committee of members of the Viceroy’s Council and Home Department.  It also included many influential Englishmen and Indians such as the Maharja Sir Jotendro Mohun Tagore, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and Sir [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]].&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

== Criticism of the Fund ==

There were three major criticisms of the Fund: its teaching, effectiveness, and integrity.  Many believed the Fund was inefficient.  Some argued that they inadequately taught doctors and employed subpar medical practitioners.&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;Conrad, Lawrence I., and Anne Hardy. "Western Feminism, Western Medicine, and Colonial Medical Practice." Women and Modern Medicine. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001. 42-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 1908, only 43 completely qualified women medical professionals were working under the Fund however only 11 held university degrees.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, Kathleen O. "The Countess of Dufferin's Fund." The British Medical Journal (1908): 1219-220. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Journal]] wrote in 1908 that, “The Government appears to have a perfect delight in swamping the country with unqualified medical practitioners."&lt;ref name=Vaughan/&gt;  The Fund was also criticized as ineffective for placing male doctors in Zenana hospitals.  Zenana women’s traditions forbade them from seeing, so they could be treated by the doctors the Fund provided.  In addition, the Fund was also criticized for not giving the women they were educating enough reason to stay with learning medicine.  The Fund paid for their education however their salaries were not high enough so it made more financial sense for the women to marry before they could give back to the hospital that educated them.  The Fund set up this cycle of educating women who would then work for them, however, it was ineffective in some cases because the women would not stick with the medical profession for financial reasons.  Because of the many criticisms of ineffectiveness, some of the Fund’s highest critics like The British Medical Journal called for a reorganization of the Fund.  Some also believed vanity, not philanthropy, was the source of motivation for establishing the Fund.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;  They criticized both Lady Dufferin for starting the Fund for her personal image and Queen Victoria for supporting the Fund for Britain’s international image.

== After Lady Dufferin ==

The Fund continued even after Lady Dufferin’s term ended.  Lady Lansdowne, who succeeded Lady Dufferin, continued to put work into the Fund which was passed down from vicereine to vicereine until 1947.&lt;ref name=Nightengale/&gt;  In 1947, India gained independence from Great Britain and the Fund was taken over by the Central Indian Government by the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957.  Once the Fund was taken over by the Central Government, it became obsolete.  In 2005 a bill was passed repealing the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957, for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name=GOVERNMENT&gt;"GOVERNMENT BILLS: Discussion On The Countess Of Dufferin'S Fund ... on 5 December 2002."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17784">'''Discrete logarithm records''' are the best results achieved to date in solving the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, which is the problem of finding solutions ''x'' to the equation ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h'' given elements ''g'' and ''h'' of a finite [[cyclic group]]&amp;nbsp;''G''.  The difficulty of this problem is the basis for the security of several [[cryptographic]] systems, including [[Diffie–Hellman]] key agreement, [[ElGamal encryption]], the [[ElGamal signature scheme]], the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]], and the [[elliptic curve cryptography]] analogs of these.  Common choices for ''G'' used in these algorithms include the multiplicative group of integers modulo&amp;nbsp;''p'', the multiplicative group of a [[finite field]], and the group of points on an [[elliptic curve]] over a [[finite field]].

==Integers modulo ''p''==

On 16 June 2016, Thorsten Kleinjung, Claus Diem, [[Arjen K. Lenstra]], Christine Priplata, and Colin Stahlke announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 232-digit (768-bit) [[safe prime]], using the number field sieve.  The computation was started in February 2015 and took approximately 6600 core years scaled to an Intel Xeon E5-2660 at 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;a0c66b63.1606 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 768 bits,”] June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records for integers modulo ''p'' include:

* On 18 June 2005, [[Antoine Joux]] and Reynald Lercier announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 130-digit (431-bit) [[strong prime]] in  three weeks, using a 1.15&amp;nbsp;GHz 16-processor HP [[AlphaServer GS1280]] computer and a [[number field sieve]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0506&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=20 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 130 digits,”] June 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 5 February 2007 this was superseded by the announcement by Thorsten Kleinjung of the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 160-digit (530-bit) [[safe prime]], again using the number field sieve.  Most of the computation was done using idle time on various PCs and on a parallel computing cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0702&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;P=R45&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;T=0 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 160 digits,”] February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 June 2014, Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel Thomé announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 180 digit (596-bit) safe prime using the number field sieve algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel
Thomé, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1406&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3161 "Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 180 digits"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite fields==

The current record ({{As of|2014|1|alt=as of January 2014}}) in a finite field of characteristic 2 was announced by Robert Granger, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel on 31 January 2014.  This team was able to compute discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;9234&lt;/sup&gt;) using about 400,000 core hours.  New features of this computation include a modified method for obtaining the logarithms of degree two elements and a systematically optimized descent strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Zumbrägel, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^9234)", 31 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;9aa2b043.1401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records in a finite field of characteristic 2 were announced by:

* Antoine Joux on 21 May 2013.  His team was able to compute discrete logarithms in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt; = (2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; elements using less than 550 CPU-hours. This computation was performed using the same index calculus algorithm as in the recent computation in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt;) [=GF((2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;)]", May 21, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1305&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3034.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 11 Apr 2013.  The new computation concerned the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6120&lt;/sup&gt; elements and took 749.5 core-hours.
* Antoine Joux on Mar 22nd, 2013. This used the same algorithm &lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux. A new index calculus algorithm with complexity $L(1/4+o(1))$ in very small characteristic, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/095&lt;/ref&gt; for small characteristic fields as the previous computation in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The new computation concerned the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt; elements, represented as a degree 255 extension of the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The computation took less than 14100 core hours.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt;)", Mar 22, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1303&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13682.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 19 Feb 2013.  They used a new variant of the medium-sized base field [[function field sieve]], for binary fields, to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1971&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  In order to use a medium-sized base field, they represented the field as a degree 73 extension of the field of 2&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The computation took 3132 core hours on an SGI Altix ICE 8200EX cluster using Intel (Westmere) Xeon E5650 hex-core processors.&lt;ref&gt;Faruk Gologlu et al.,  On the Function Field Sieve and the Impact of Higher Splitting Probabilities: Application to Discrete Logarithms in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{2^{1971}}&lt;/math&gt;, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/074.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antoine Joux on 11 Feb 2013. This used a new algorithm for small characteristic fields. The computation concerned a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt; elements, represented as a degree 127 extension of the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The computation took less than 220 core hours.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt;)", Feb. 11, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1302&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record ({{As of|2014|alt=as of 2014}}) in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by Thorsten Kleinjung on 17 October 2014. The calculation was done in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1279&lt;/sup&gt; elements and followed essentially the path sketched for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{2^{4 \cdot 1223}}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;ref&gt;Granger, Robert, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel. “Breaking `128-Bit Secure’ Supersingular Binary Curves (or How to Solve Discrete Logarithms in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb F}_{2^{4 \cdot 1223}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb F}_{2^{12 \cdot 367}}&lt;/math&gt;).” arXiv:1402.3668 [cs, Math], February 15, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3668.&lt;/ref&gt; with two main exceptions in the linear algebra computation and the descent phase.  The total running time was less than four core years.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, 2014 October 17, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^1279)", https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;256db68e.1410.&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous record in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by the CARAMEL group on April 6, 2013.  They used the [[function field sieve]] to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;The CARAMEL group:  Razvan Barbulescu and Cyril Bouvier and Jérémie Detrey and Pierrick Gaudry and Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel Thomé and Marion Videau and Paul Zimmermann, “Discrete logarithm in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt;) with FFS”, April 6, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record ({{As of|2016|7|alt=as of July 2016}})  for a field of characteristic 3 was announced by 
Gora Adj, Isaac Canales-Martinez, Nareli Cruz-Cortés, Alfred Menezes, Thomaz Oliveira, Francisco Rodriguez-Henriquez, and Luis Rivera-Zamarripa on {{date|18 July 2016}}.  The calculation was done in the 4841-bit finite field with 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;509&lt;/sup&gt; elements and was performed on several computers at [[CINVESTAV]] and
the [[University of Waterloo]]. In total, about 200 core years of computing time was expended on the computation.
&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Rodriguez-Henriquez, 18 July 2016, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(3^{6*509})", https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;65bedfc8.1607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records in a finite field of characteristic 3 were announced:

* in the full version of the Asiacrypt 2014 paper of Joux and Pierrot (December 2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://www-polsys.lip6.fr/~pierrot/papers/Simplified%20Frob%20Rep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The DLP is solved in the field GF(3&lt;sup&gt;5&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;479&lt;/sup&gt;), which is a 3796-bit field. This work did not exploit any "special" aspects of the field such as Kummer or twisted-Kummer properties. The total computation took less than 8600 CPU-hours.
* by Gora Adj, Alfred Menezes, Thomaz Oliveira, and Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez on 26 February 2014, updating a previous announcement on 27 January 2014.  The computation solve DLP in the 1551-bit field GF(3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;163&lt;/sup&gt;), taking 1201 CPU hours.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, “Announcement,” 27 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;763a9e76.1401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gora Adj and Alfred Menezes and Thomaz Oliveira and Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, "Computing Discrete Logarithms in F_{3^{6*137}} and F_{3^{6*163}} using Magma", 26 Feb 2014, http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/057.&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2012 by a joint Fujitsu, NICT, and Kyushu University team, that computed a discrete logarithm in the field of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;97&lt;/sup&gt; elements and a size of 923 bits,&lt;ref&gt;Kyushu University, NICT and Fujitsu Laboratories Achieve World Record Cryptanalysis of Next-Generation Cryptography, 2012, http://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2012/06/PDF-att/20120618en.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; using a variation on the [[function field sieve]] and beating the previous record in a field of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/sup&gt; elements and size of 676 bits by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;Takuya Hayashi et al., Solving a 676-bit Discrete Logarithm Problem in GF(3&lt;sup&gt;6''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), 2010, http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over fields of "moderate"-sized characteristic, notable computations as of 2005 included those a field of 65537&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; elements (401 bits) announced on 24 Oct 2005, and in a field of 370801&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; elements (556 bits) announced on 9 Nov 2005.&lt;ref&gt;A. Durand, “New records in computations over large numbers,” The Security Newsletter, January 2005, http://eric-diehl.com/letter/Newsletter1_Final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The current record (as of 2013) for a finite field of "moderate" characteristic was announced on 6 January 2013.  The team used a new variation of the [[function field sieve]] for the medium prime case to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 33341353&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; elements (a 1425-bit finite field).&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, “Discrete Logarithms in a 1425-bit Finite Field,” January 6, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1301&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joux-ePrint"&gt;Faster index calculus for the medium prime case. Application to 1175-bit and 1425-bit finite fields,   Eprint Archive, http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/720&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique had been used a few weeks earlier to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 33553771&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; elements (an 1175-bit finite field).&lt;ref  name="Joux-ePrint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, “Discrete Logarithms in a 1175-bit Finite Field,” December 24, 2012, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1212&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13902.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2014, Razvan Barbulescu, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, and François Morain announced a new computation of a discrete logarithm in a finite field whose order has 160 digits and is a degree 2 extension of a prime field.&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Barbulescu, “Discrete logarithms in GF(p^2) --- 160 digits,” June 24, 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;2ddabd4c.1406.&lt;/ref&gt;  The algorithm used was the number field sieve (NFS), with various modifications. The total computing time was equivalent to 68 days on one core of CPU (sieving) and 30 hours on a GPU (linear algebra).

==Elliptic curves==

[[Certicom]] Corp. has issued a series of Elliptic Curve Cryptography challenges.  Level I involves fields of 109-bit and 131-bit sizes.  Level II includes 163, 191, 239, 359-bit sizes. All Level II challenges are currently believed to be computationally infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Corp., “The Certicom ECC Challenge,” http://www.certicom.com/index.php/the-certicom-ecc-challenge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Level I challenges which have been met are:&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Research, Certicom ECC Challenge (Certicom Research, November 10, 2009), {{cite web |url=http://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022135946/https://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-22 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

* ECC2K-108, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a [[Koblitz curve]] over a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The prize was awarded on 4 April 2000 to a group of about 1300 people represented by Robert Harley.  They used a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]] with speedup.
* ECC2-109, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a curve over a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The prize was awarded on 8 April 2004 to a group of about 2600 people represented by Chris Monico.  They also used a version of a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]], taking 17 months of calendar time.
* ECCp-109, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a curve modulo a 109-bit prime.  The prize was awarded on 15 Apr 2002 to a group of about 10308 people represented by Chris Monico.  Once again, they used a version of a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]], taking 549 days of calendar time.

None of the 131-bit (or larger) challenges have been met {{As of|2016|alt=as of 2016}}.

In July 2009, Joppe W. Bos, Marcelo E. Kaihara, Thorsten Kleinjung, Arjen K. Lenstra and [[Peter Montgomery (mathematician)|Peter L. Montgomery]] announced that they had carried out a discrete logarithm computation on an elliptic curve modulo a 112-bit prime.  The computation was done on a cluster of over 200 [[PlayStation 3]] game consoles over about 6 months.  They used the common parallelized version of [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]].&lt;ref&gt;Joppe W. Bos and Marcelo E. Kaihara, “PlayStation 3 computing breaks 2^60 barrier:  112-bit prime ECDLP solved,” EPFL Laboratory for cryptologic algorithms - LACAL, http://lacal.epfl.ch/112bit_prime&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Erich Wenger]] and [[Paul Wolfger]] from [[Graz University of Technology]] solved the discrete logarithm of a 113-bit Koblitz curve in extrapolated 24 days using an 18-core [[Virtex-6]] [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Wenger and Paul Wolfger, “Solving the Discrete Logarithm of a 113-bit Koblitz Curve with an FPGA Cluster” http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/368&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015,the same researchers solved the discrete logarithm of an elliptic curve defined over a 113-bit binary field. The average runtime is around 82 days using a 10-core [[Kintex-7]] [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Wenger and Paul Wolfger, “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Computations on FPGAs” http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/143/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2016,  [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], [[Susanne Engels]], [[Tanja Lange]], [[Ruben Niederhagen]], [[Christof Paar]], [[Peter Schwabe]], and [[Ralf Zimmermann]] announced the solution of a generic 117.35-bit elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem on a binary curve, using an optimized FPGA implementation of a parallel version of [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]].  The attack ran for about six months on 64 to 576 FPGAs in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Niederhagen, “117.35-Bit ECDLP on Binary Curve,” https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;628a3b51.1612 {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2017, Takuya Kusaka, Sho Joichi, Ken Ikuta, Md. Al-Amin Khandaker, Yasuyuki Nogami, Satoshi Uehara, Nariyoshi Yamai, and Sylvain Duquesne announced that they had solved a discrete logarithm problem on a 114-bit "pairing-friendly" Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isec.ec.okayama-u.ac.jp/whats-new/114-bit-ecdlp-has-been-solved|title= 114-bit ECDLP on a BN curve has been solved  |accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the special sextic twist property of the BN curve to efficiently carry out the random walk of Pollard’s rho method.  The implementation used 2000 CPU cores and took about 6 months to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-78556-1_13 |title= Solving 114-Bit ECDLP for a Barreto-Naehrig Curve|last1=Kusaka |first1=Takuya  |last2=Joichi |first2= Sho |first3=Ken|last3= Ikuta|first4= Md.

===2010===
In September 2010, GMA Life TV has 122,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Pinoy TV has a total of 256,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/6812/GMA-Pinoy-TV-and-GMA-Life-TV-initiate-projects-that-will-enrich-lives-of-Filipinos-abroad|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV initiate projects that will enrich lives of Filipinos abroad - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=16 September 2010|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, as of 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Life TV has around 126,000 subscribers. The number of subscribers began to substantially increase when the channel was launched during the early part of this year in other areas such us Florida (via Brighhouse Tampa), Texas (via En-Touch), Hong Kong (via PCCW), and Central California (via Comcast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=163|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
By 2011, GMA Life TV will air re-runs of previous GMA shows as QTV will be re-formatted into GMA News TV. GMA News TV will also be available in the worldwide market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmaseven.blogspot.com//2010/12/qtv-will-be-relaunched-as-gma-news-tv.html|title=Girl Power dating wisdom|author=|date=|website=gmaseven.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7578/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv-on-channel-11|title=GMA-7 launches GMA News TV on Channel 11 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=2 February 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This did occur from 20 February 2011 onward, the decision was to run movies temporarily in place of the previously aired programs from the now-ceased [[Q (TV network)|QTV]].

On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA Worldwide, Inc. history, two programs that started airing on [[GMA Pinoy TV]] that is still running with new episodes was switched over to GMA Life TV, where it will then air its new episodes, to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included '''Pinoy MD''' and [[Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis]].

On 30 June 2014, [[My Rosy Life|A Rosy Life]] re-airs for the second time on GMA Life TV, followed by the second re-run of [[Sassy Girl Chun Hyang|Sassy Girl]] on 22 September 2014 and [[Bad Love (TV series)|Cruel Love]] on 17 November 2014.

The Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.&lt;ref&gt;http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/008/1800843.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutscher Bundestag]]: [http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss 1. Untersuchungsausschuss („NSA“)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2014/50515028_kw15_binninger/216908|title=Deutscher Bundestag - NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: Binninger tritt vom Ausschussvorsitz zurück|author=Karl Otto Sattler|date=9 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-04/nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-binninger-ruecktritt NSA-Ausschussvorsitzender geht im Streit], Zeit.de, April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Sensburg]] (CDU) succeeded him.

== Witnesses ==

=== Discussion about the witness Snowden ===
On May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014]. Website FAZ, accessed September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-spaehaffaere-opposition-verklagt-merkel-wegen-snowden-a-994029.html|title=NSA Sphaffre: Opposition verklagt Merkel wegen Snowden  - SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=28 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony of Binney and Drake ===
On July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], who had become a whistleblower after the [[9/11|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-9-11-hat-alles-veraendert.aeedf44b-6825-4583-a740-0c20c0bd723a.html|title=NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: 9/11  hat alles verändert - Politik - Stuttgarter Zeitung|author=Stuttgarter Zeitung|location=Stuttgart, Germany|date=3 July 2014|work=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur], Der Spiegel, July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Former NSA employee [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst „ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA“], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND untersttzte Drohnenkrieg der USA|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed testimony of Greenwald ===
The US journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a "ritual" that "shall seem like an investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glenn-greenwald-sagt-zeugenvernehmung-vor-nsa-ausschuss-ab-a-984030.html|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Zeugenvernehmung vor NSA-Ausschuss ab|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=1 August 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/glenn-greenwald-sagt-untersuchungsausschuss-ab-ritual-das-die-illusion-einer-untersuchung-erwecken-soll|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Untersuchungsausschuss ab: "Ritual, das die Illusion einer Untersuchung erwecken soll"|work=netzpolitik.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Eikonal selectors==
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" from the NSA − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements.

== Spying on the committee ==
On July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neue-medienberichte-festgenommener-bnd-mann-spionierte-auch-fuer-die-cia-1.2032849 Medien: Festgenommener BND-Mann spionierte für CIA], Süddeutsche.de, July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the US ambassador [[John B. Emerson]] was summoned for talks at the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/Untersuchungsausschuss-zur-NSA/!141758/|title=BNDler soll für USA spioniert haben: Der amerikanische Brieföffner - taz.de|author=taz. die tageszeitung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/nsa-ausschuss-bnd-mitarbeiter-unter-spionageverdacht-1.2030878|title=BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Ausschuss ausspioniert haben|work=Süddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/festnahme-spion-100.html|title=31-Jähriger festgenommen: BND-Mitarbeiter ein US-Spion? - tagesschau.de|date=5 July 2014|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-spion-us-botschafter-emerson-ins-auswaertige-amt-gebeten-a-979318.html|title=BND-Spion: US-Botschafter Emerson ins Auswrtige Amt gebeten|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-spion-berlin-zoegert-wie-bei-nsa-mit-reaktionen-gegenueber-obama-a-979526.html|title=BND-Spion: Berlin zgert wie bei NSA mit Reaktionen gegenber Obama|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=6 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Festnahme-BND-Mitarbeiter-soll-NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss-ausspioniert-haben-2249652.html|title=Festnahme: BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ausspioniert haben|date=4 July 2014|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-verfassungsschutz-wollte-agenten-mit-us-hilfe-enttarnen-a-979416.html|title=BND: Verfassungsschutz wollte Agenten mit US-Hilfe enttarnen|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=5 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2014, a second US spy was discovered, who worked for the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-spionageaffaere-razzia-100.html|title=Durchsuchung in Berlin: Weiterer US-Spion enttarnt?|date=9 July 2014|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausweitung-der-geheimdienstaffaere-ermittlungen-gegen-us-spion-im-verteidigungsministerium-1.2038151|title=Zweiter US-Spion im Verteidigungsministerium|work=Süddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of [[Roderich Kiesewetter]], representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/ulm/kiesewetter-offenbar-abgehoert/-/id=1612/did=13735756/nid=1612/1hqz7ou/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document leaks ==
In the months following May 2015, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the Austrian parliament for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], disclosed several documents and transcripts related to [[operation Eikonal]], in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of [[Deutsche Telekom]] in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2015/11/unnoticed-leak-answers-and-raises.html Unnoticed leak answers and raises questions about operation Eikonal], November 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.format.at/articles/1430/930/376970/spionage-peter-pilz-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss|title=Spionage: Peter Pilz fordert einen NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|work=format.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2016, [[WikiLeaks]] released over 2,400 documents which it claims are from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Uchill |first=Joe |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/308407-wikileaks-drops-docs-on-inquiry-into-nsa-german-cooperation |title=WikiLeaks publishes docs on inquiry into German cooperation with NSA |work=The Hill |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6401">The '''Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health''' was a program of the [[United Nations]] (UN) directed at improving women's and children's health in the developing world.

The program was announced by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEjj_XD4L21sQLY3DEogHXxLXQHAD9ICPTGG0|title=UN promotes health campaign for women, children|last=Snow|first=Anita|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The objective of the program was to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11392954|title=UN launches $40bn woman and child health plan|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4, 5 and 6 were showing the slowest rate of progression, this program was also instituted to gain momentum in achieving them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/node/8936/pdf/ewec_progress_report_final_3.pdf|title=Saving Lives Protecting Futures: Progress Report on the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health 2010-2015|work=Resource Centre|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the program was led by the [[World Health Organization]], reporting to the UN.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-governments-pledge|title=Millennium development goals: governments pledge £25.5bn to eradicate world poverty|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|author2=Curtis, Polly|date=22 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68L1K820100922|title=U.N. chief to launch women, children health drive|last=Worsnip|first=Patrick|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International aid group [[Oxfam]] expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

== Progress: 2010-2015 ==
The Global Strategy managed to improve the coordination of global efforts towards the improvement of women’s and children’s health as well as enhancing strategies to tackle this. It gave rise to the “Every Woman Every Child” movement, which assisted in the mobilisation of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite not reaching targets, reductions in both child and [[Maternal Mortality|maternal mortality]] were noted; of 49% and 45% respectively from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Temmerman|first=Marleen|last2=Khosla|first2=Rajat|last3=Bhutta|first3=Zulfiqar A.|last4=Bustreo|first4=Flavia|date=2015-09-14|title=Towards a new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4414|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4414|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4414|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26371228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.4 million maternal and child deaths were prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, [[oral rehydration therapy]] and exclusive breastfeeding coverage showed the most significant improvement, however, progress in [[vaccination]] and [[pneumonia]] was still lagging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also reported increased collaboration with the private sector, with an increase in donor funding of US$19.8 billion noted from September 2010 to May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28518">'''Global citizenship education''' ('''GCE''') is a form of [[civics|civic learning]] that involves students' active participation in projects that address [[global issue|global]] [[global issue|issue]]s of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are '[[global consciousness]]';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of [[supranational institution]], [[trade bloc|regional economic blocs]], and the development of [[information and communications technology|information and]] [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]]. These have allresulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students

== Definition and origins ==
[[Global citizenship]] consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status  or allegiance to an actual form of government.  The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the [[European Union|European]] [[European Union|Union]], and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education  programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent [[NGO]]s, [[grass roots]] organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] and [[UNESCO]].

The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, [[OXFAM]] UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education
which stressed "the 'active' role of global citizens".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE [[curricula]], to "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".

== Emergence and development ==
In the present era of [[globalization]], the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. No Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.

Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the  diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education".   In addition, global issues related to [[sustainability]], such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.

== Competences ==
While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. ''Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity);
* A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future);
* Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi-perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach);
* Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and con ict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and
* Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Most educators agree that "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, 2010:442&lt;/ref&gt; and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, "[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:14&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Melaville &amp; Berg et al, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that "harness […] the educational force of the wider culture".&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"&gt;Catalano, 2013:3&lt;/ref&gt; If students are encouraged "to see themselves as political agents",&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"/&gt; educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to  become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via [[Social network services|Social Network Services]], create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is  an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' ([[Global Issues Network]]), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"&gt;Dill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.

;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence'

Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' "features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Grudinski Hall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: "using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013: 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key learner attributes ==
GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education: topics and learning objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100102-4|location=|pages=20–21, 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed and critically literate ===
Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), [[media literacy]] and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Socially connected and respectful of diversity ===
Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethically responsible and engaged ===
Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to [[climate change]], [[consumerism]], [[Economic globalization|economic globalisation]], [[fair trade]], migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, [[terrorism]], war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== High Resolves, Australia ===
[https://highresolves.org/ High Resolves] is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum,'' England ===
In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum'', a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Activate, South Africa ===
'''Activate''' is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activateleadership.co.za/blog/5-mins-with-fernando#sthash.dRCXMqPx.dpuf|title=Activate Change Drivers|last=|first=|date=|website=Activate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Council for Global Citizenship Education, India (and global) ===
[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/council-for-gced Council for Global Citizenship Education] — part of the [https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/ Global Citizenship Foundation], a non-profit organisation based in India — is an initiative for schools to adopt a participatory whole-school approach to global citizenship education. The initiative fosters continuous professional development (CPD) of educators; teacher led contextualization, design, and development of GCED curriculum; engagement of children through the '[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/hundred-acts 100 Acts of Global Citizenship]' School Challenge; and community through a Global Citizenship Festival at '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' participating schools. It has also been implemented in 10 States of India.

=== Peace First, United States and Colombia ===
Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

== Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ==
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.
* foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO, Paris. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_d/mod22.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; GCE and ESD help learners to develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes and values so that they can address these challenges responsibly and effectively now and in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002468/246888e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for teachers|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100180-2|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

== Objections ==

Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.&lt;ref name="Schattle, 2008"&gt;Schattle, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; Dill,&lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; for example, claims that "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:33&lt;/ref&gt; so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global silver trade''' between the Americas and [[Europe]] from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the [[Columbian Exchange]] which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the [[silver]] trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely [[global economy]], with one historian noting that silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre G.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China’s Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|quote=... silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. "New World mines," concluded several prominent historians "supported the Spanish empire," acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a 'Silver Spoon'|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards at the time of the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the [[Potosí]] silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=184|title=A Century of Lawmaking|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to extract silver from ore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver, Trade, and War: Spain and America in the Making of Early Modern Europe|last=Stein|first=Stanley J.|last2=Stein|first2=Barbara H.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines|title=Potosí Silver Mines|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh062p201.pdf|journal=Journal of World History|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities).  In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of [[China's economy]].

==First paper money==
The world's first [[paper money]] ("[[flying money]]") was invented by the Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Weksel: Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|publisher=Xlibris|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Money|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|publisher=Crown Business|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s5/s5_4.html |title=China and Europe, 1500–2000 and Beyond: What is Modern? |publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver in the Americas ==
[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver Peso of Philip V]]
A result of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as [[silk industry in China|silk]] and [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078638|journal=Journal of World History|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reorient|last=Frank|first=Andre|publisher=|year=July 1998|isbn=9780520214743|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important mining colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard L.|date=1988|title=Long-Term Silver Mining Trends in Spanish America: A Comparative Analysis of Peru and Mexico|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1863529|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=898–935|doi=10.2307/1863529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of [[Potosí]] in what is modern day Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mining Processes in the Americas ===
More simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brading|first=D. A.|last2=Cross|first2=Harry E.|date=1972|title=Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512781|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=545–579|doi=10.2307/2512781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, German miners introduced the [[stamp mill]] and [[lead smelting]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.

Mining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48249030|title=Mexico : from the beginning to the Spanish Conquest|last=1946-|first=Knight, Alan,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052181474X|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=48249030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labor system known as the [[repartimiento]] still existed in some places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Peru mines, the [[Mit'a|mit'a system]] was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Global Flow of Silver ==
The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078977|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1996|title=Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42634185|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], so estimates highly vary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Silver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.

=== China and the Demand for Silver ===
China was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123972|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=56|issue=2|pages=429–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shikuan|date=|title=The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles|url=|journal=National Taiwan University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell|first=William S.|date=2005|title=Another Look at Silver Imports into China, ca. 1635-1644|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347|journal=Journal of World History|volume=16|issue=4|pages=467–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Initially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== China's Silver Dominance ===
In the famed ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' [[Adam Smith]] noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53006965|title=The wealth of nations|last=1723-1790.|first=Smith, Adam,|date=2003|publisher=Bantam Classic|others=Cannan, Edwin, 1861-1935.|isbn=0553585975|edition=Bantam classic|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=53006965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era Trade, Power, and Belief.|last=Reid|first=Anthony J.S.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when [[Manila]] was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995-01-01|title=Arbitrage, China, and World Trade in the Early Modern Period|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568520952600308|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=38|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1163/1568520952600308|issn=0022-4995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million [[peso]]s or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell, wen-t'i|first=William S., Ch'ing-shih|date=December 1977|title=Notes on Silver, Foreign Trade, and the Late Ming Economy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398568|journal=3|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the [[Yangtze River Delta|Lower Yangzte]] averaged a hundreds of [[tael]]s of silver per household in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=Financial management|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511735400.011|work=Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China|pages=266–305|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511735400|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver even played a large role when defending [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attemptive take over of Ming ruled [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843883049|title=A dragon's head and a serpent's tail : Ming China and the first great East Asian war, 1592-1598|last=Kenneth.|first=Swope,|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806185026|location=Norman|oclc=843883049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the [[Daimyō|daimyos]] of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with [[Portugal]] and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobata|first=A.|date=1965|title=The Production and Uses of Gold and Silver in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Japan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2592093|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/2592093|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder of the Ming China dynasty, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu,]] actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|last2=Brook|first2=Timothy|date=1999|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2672136|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=72|issue=2|pages=267|doi=10.2307/2672136|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opium Wars==
{{Main|Opium Wars}}
Despite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for [[Chinese tea]], created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Immobile Empire—The first great collision of East and West—the astonishing history of Britain's grand, ill-fated expedition to open China to Western Trade, 1792–94|last=Peyrefitte|first=Alain|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|last=Gray|first=Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium "is like gold. It can sell any time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the 'Frolic': New England Merchants and the Opium Trade|last=Layton|first=Thomas N.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, "Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Documentary Chronicle of Sino-Western relations|last=Fu|first=Lo-shu|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of "drug czar." The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12228">'''Health human resources''' ('''HHR''') – also known as '''human resources for health''' ('''HRH''') or '''health workforce''' – is defined as "all people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health", according to the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2006'']].&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. ''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, 2006 – http://www.who.int/whr/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Human resources for health are identified as one of the core building blocks of a [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/en/index.html Health Systems Topics.] Geneva. &lt;/ref&gt; They include [[physicians]], [[nurses|nursing professionals]], [[midwives]], [[dentists]], [[allied health professions]], [[community health worker]]s, social health workers and other [[health care provider]]s, as well as health management and support personnel – those who may not deliver services directly but are essential to effective health system functioning, including [[health administration|health services managers]], [[health information management|medical records and health information technicians]], health economists, health supply chain managers, medical secretaries and others. 

The field of health human resources deals with issues such as [[workforce planning|planning]], development, performance, [[human resource management|management]], [[employee retention|retention]], information, and research on [[human resources]] for the [[health care]] sector. In recent years, raising awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the [[global health]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Grepin K, Savedoff WD. "10 Best Resources on ... health workers in developing countries." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2009; 24(6):479–482 http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/6/479&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global situation ==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of health care workers]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and support workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt; The shortage is most severe in 57 of the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The situation was declared on [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2006]] as a "health workforce crisis" – the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, [[wage]]s, working environment and management. 

Shortages of skilled for health workers are also reported in many specific care areas. For example, there is an estimated shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000 nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries''. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011 – available on http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of [[birth attendant|skilled birth attendants]] in many developing countries remains an important barrier to improving [[maternal health]] outcomes. Many countries, both developed and developing, report maldistribution of skilled health workers leading to [[Health care provider#Shortages of health professionals|shortages in rural and underserved areas]].

Regular statistical updates on the global health workforce situation are collated in the WHO ''Global Health Observatory''.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/gho/health_workforce/en/ ''Global Health Observatory (GHO) data: Health workforce.''] Geneva. Accessed 8 Aug 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence base remains fragmented and incomplete, largely related to weaknesses in the underlying [[HRHIS|human resource information systems]] (HRIS) within countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. (eds). ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health'', Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009 – available on http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to learn from best practices in addressing health workforce challenges and strengthening the evidence base, an increasing number of HHR practitioners from around the world are focusing on issues such as HHR advocacy, surveillance and collaborative practice. Some examples of global HRH partnerships include:

== Research ==
Health workforce research is the investigation of how social, economic, organizational, political and policy factors affect access to health care professionals, and how the organization and composition of the workforce itself can affect health care delivery, quality, [[health equity|equity]], and costs. 

Many government [[health department]]s, academic institutions and related agencies have established research programs to identify and quantify the scope and nature of HHR problems leading to [[health policy]] in building an innovative and sustainable health services workforce in their jurisdiction. Some examples of HRH information and research dissemination programs include:

== Policy and planning ==
In some countries and jurisdictions, health workforce planning is distributed among [[Labour economics|labour market]] participants. In others, there is an explicit [[health policy|policy or strategy]] adopted by governments and systems to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet health care goals. For one, the [[International Council of Nurses]] reports:&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Nurses. ''Health human resources planning''. Geneva, 2008 – {{cite web |url=http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161502/http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of HHRP [health human resources planning] is to provide the right number of health care workers with the right knowledge, skills, attitudes, and qualifications, performing the right tasks in the right place at the right time to achieve the right predetermined health targets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An essential component of planned HRH targets is [[supply and demand]] modeling, or the use of appropriate data to link population health needs and/or health care delivery targets with human resources supply, distribution and [[workforce productivity|productivity]]. The results are intended to be used to generate evidence-based policies to guide workforce sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.'' Geneva, World Health Organization, 2010 – http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/hhr-rhs/strateg/index-eng.php ''Health Human Resource Strategy (HHRS)''.] Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In resource-limited countries, HRH planning approaches are often driven by the needs of targeted programmes or projects, for example, those responding to the [[Millennium Development Goals]] or, more recently, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreesch N et al. "An approach to estimating human resource requirements to achieve the Millennium Development Goals." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2005; 20(5):267–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need'' (WISN) is an HRH planning and management tool that can be adapted to local circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN): User's manual.'' Geneva, 2010 – http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/wisn_user_manual/en/ &lt;/ref&gt; It provides health managers a systematic way to make staffing decisions in order to better manage their human resources, based on a health worker's [[workload]], with activity (time) standards applied for each workload component at a given health facility.

===Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel===
The main international policy framework for addressing shortages and maldistribution of health professionals is the ''Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel'', adopted by the WHO's 63rd [[World Health Assembly]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''International recruitment of health personnel: global code of practice.'' Resolution adopted by the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Geneva, May 2010 – available on http://apps.who.int/gb/e/e_wha63.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was developed in a context of increasing debate on international health worker recruitment, especially in some higher income countries, and its impact on the ability of many developing countries to deliver [[primary health care]] services. Although non-binding on the Member States and recruitment agencies, the Code promotes principles and practices for the ethical international recruitment of health personnel. It also advocates the strengthening of health personnel information systems to support effective health workforce policies and planning in countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inter Press Service''' ('''IPS''') is a global [[news agency]]. Its main focus is the production of news and analysis about events and processes affecting economic, social and political [[international development|development]]. The agency largely covers news on the [[Global South]], [[civil society]], and [[globalization]].

==History==
Inter Press Service was set up in 1964 as a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] international [[cooperative]] of journalists. Its founders were the Italian journalist [[Roberto Savio]] and the Argentine political scientist Pablo Piacentini. Initially, the primary objective of IPS was to fill the information gap between Europe and Latin America after the political turbulence following the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 (Giffard in Salwen and Garrison, 1991).&lt;ref name=history&gt;IPS, [http://www.ips.org/institutional/get-to-know-us-2/our-history/ Our history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the network expanded to include all continents, beginning with a Latin American base in Costa Rica in 1982,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and extended its editorial focus. In 1994, IPS changed its legal status to that of a "public-benefit organization for development cooperation".

In 1996 IPS had permanent offices and correspondents in 41 countries, covering 108 nations. It had as subscribers over 600 print media, around 80 news agencies and database services, and 65 broadcast media, in addition to over 500 NGOs and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard, C. Anthony (1998) "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6dNtpqQa1zoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA194 Alternative News Agencies]" In: Boyd-Barrett, O. and Rantanen, T.; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News''. London: Sage Publications, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
[[File:Talk Nation Radio - 2011-02-28 Dahr Jamail, Uprisings and Oil in the Middle East.vorb.oga|thumb|Dahr Jamail, on his Al Jazeera and Inter Press Service News reports]]
IPS’s stated aims are to give prominence to the voices of [[marginalization|marginalized]] and vulnerable people and groups, report from the perspectives of [[developing country|developing countries]], and to reflect the views of [[civil society]]. The mainstreaming of [[gender]] in reporting and the assessment of the impacts of [[globalization]] are a priority.

IPS may be unique in its concentration on [[developing country|developing countries]] and the strong relationships with [[civil society]]. For this reason, IPS has even been termed the probably "largest and most credible of all 'alternatives' in the world of news agencies" (Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen, 1998: 174/5),&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver and Rantanen, Terhi; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News'' London: Sage Publication&lt;/ref&gt; being the "first and only independent and professional news agency which provides on a daily basis information with a Third World focus and point of view" (Boyd-Barrett and Thussu, 1992: 94; cf. Giffard, 1998: 191; Fenby, 1986).

Despite all the laudable aims, it is, however, important to see that IPS has never possessed the resources to be a major player in the international media landscape. Because of its focus on longer background pieces focusses on development issues impacting the lives of people in the South instead of concise news, it is yet to be a news provider for mainstream media in developed countries. In fairness to IPS, mainstream media often rely on their own fly in and out journalists from where IPS reports.

==Legal status==
IPS is registered as an international [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit association]]. It has 'general' NGO consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] at the [[United Nations]], and the [[OECD]] status of [[Official Development Assistance|"ODA eligible international organization"]].

==Organizational structure==
Five editorial desks coordinate the network of journalists around the world: Montevideo (regional bureau for Latin America), Berlin-London (Europe and the Mediterranean), Bangkok (Asia and the Pacific), New York (North America and the Caribbean) and Johannesburg (Africa). Most of IPS's journalists and editors are native to the country or region in which they are working.

IPS receives funding from various sources: through its subscribers and media clients, as beneficiary of multilateral and national development cooperation programmes, and as recipient of project financing from [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]]. It is not, as most other agencies, financed by a country or a group of newspapers. Hence, the agency’s budget is comparatively small. Still it manages to be "roughly the sixth largest international news-gathering organization" (Rauch, 2003: 89).

==IPS's role in the mediascape==
The actual role of IPS in the international [[mediascape]] is hard to assess. Clipping services are expensive, and do not exist in many countries where IPS is strong. Additionally, in some countries news agencies are not credited in bylines. One study by the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for media coverage of the FAO in 1991 found that of the nearly 3000 clippings with news agency bylines, 13% credited IPS, making it the third-most cited agency. IPS reports were collected from 138 different publications in 39 countries - more countries than any other agency. IPS was particularly strong in Latin America - 72% of clippings from Latin America with news agency bylines came from IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard (1998:195)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UIC dark green - active, light green - associate, brown - affiliate.png|thumb|350px|UIC members {{legend|#008000|active}} {{legend|#00FF00|associated}} {{legend|#804000|affiliated}}]]

The '''UIC''' ({{lang-fr|'''Union Internationale des Chemins de fer'''}}) or '''International Union of Railways''' is an international [[rail transport]] industry body.

== History ==

The railways of Europe originated as many separate concerns, and there were many border changes after [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Colonial railways were the responsibility of the mother country. Into this environment the UIC was created on 17 October 1922,&lt;ref&gt;http://uic.org/1922-UIC-a-long-life-organisation&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of standardising industry practices.

Ticket revenue sharing was originally undertaken with the [[UIC Franc]] currency equivalent.  [[UIC classification]] and [[UIC Country Code]]s allowed precise determination of rolling stock capabilities and ownership, with wagons assigned unique [[UIC wagon numbers]].  The 1990s [[GSM-R]] radio telecommunication system is an international [[interoperability]] specification covering voice and signalling systems for railway communications whose specification is maintained by the International Union of Railways project [[ERTMS]].

== Mission ==

The UIC's mission is "to promote rail transport at world level and meet the challenges of mobility and sustainable development."&lt;ref name="UIC website"&gt;[http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article528 UIC Overview] as at 12 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The UIC's main objectives&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; are to:

* Facilitate the sharing of best practices among members (benchmarking)
* Support members in their efforts to develop new business and new areas of activities
* Propose new ways to improve technical and environmental performance
* Promote interoperability, create new world standards for railways (including common standards with other transport modes)
* Develop centres of competence (High Speed, Safety, Security, e-Business, …)

== Members ==

When founded in 1922 the UIC had 51 members from 29 countries, including [[Japan]] and [[China]]. They were soon joined by the [[USSR]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Today, the UIC has 194 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://vademecum.uic.org/en/ VADEMECUM (LIST OF UIC MEMBERS)]&lt;/ref&gt; across 5 continents.&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; Of these there are:

On 12 November 2010, the UIC opened an African regional office in [[Tunis]] with the support of [[SNCFT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/iru-office-opened-in-tunis/|accessdate=2010-11-27|title=UIC OFFICE FOR AFRICA OPENED IN TUNIS|website=Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard terminology ==

[[File:UIC pallet marking.JPG|thumbnail|UIC mark on an [[EUR-pallet|EPAL]] pallet. EPAL has criticised the UIC for poor quality assurance processes which, according to EPAL, permit [[counterfeit]] or inferior quality pallets to enter the European pallet pool.&lt;ref&gt;EPAL, ''EPAL assumes responsibility for the pallet pool's safety and quality'', 12 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to provide a common understanding and reduce potential confusion, the UIC has established standard international railway terminology and a trilingual (English-French-German) thesaurus of terms. The thesaurus was the result of cooperation with the [[European Conference of Ministers of Transport]] (ECMT/{{lang|fr|CEMT}}) and was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| title=Transport Thesaurus| year=1995| accessdate=May 20, 2009| publisher=UIC| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606032638/http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| archivedate=6 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of railway vehicles ==

The UIC has established systems for the classification of [[UIC identification marking for tractive stock|locomotives]] and their [[UIC classification|axle arrangements]], [[UIC classification of railway coaches|coaches]] and [[UIC classification of goods wagons|goods wagons]].

== Some UIC regulations ==

UIC plays an important role in standardization of railway parts, data and terminology. Therefore, UIC codes (also known as '''UIC leaflet''') are developed since the beginning of UIC's work. A new term for these UIC leaflets is used by UIC for better understanding: '''International Railway Solution''' ('''IRS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnien|first=Airy|title=UIC e-news|url=http://uic.org/com/uic-e-news/394|publisher=UIC|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[UIC code]]s are:

* [[UIC 568]] The 13-corded standardized connection [[Electrical cable|cable]] with connector is used to transmit data and commands between the [[locomotive]] and the carriages of a [[passenger train]].
* UIC 592-2 Large containers for transport on wagons - Technical conditions to be fulfilled by large containers accepted for use in international traffic. Describes the classes and categories of large containers, handling characteristics,  identification markings, and special conditions applying to large tank containers.
* UIC 592-3 Large containers (CT), swap bodies (CM) and transport frames for horizontal transhipment (CA) - Standard report on acceptance tests.
* UIC 592-4 Swap bodies for grab handling and spreader gripping - Technical conditions. Swap bodies are the removable superstructures of road transport vehicles. Their dimensions and some of their fittings are standardised, particularly  dimensions, strength parameters and securing devices, of the road vehicle, the wagon and transhipment arrangements (grab-handling grooves, lower securing parts and, in special cases, upper securing parts).
* UIC 596-5 Transport of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conveyance of semi-trailers with P coding or N coding on recess wagons. This leaflet sets out regulations and provisions for semi-trailers with normal road transport characteristics for conveyance on fixed-recess carrier wagons. The provisions are valid for semi-trailers, gantry equipment/industrial trucks with grab handles, recess wagon types 1a and 1b in accordance with UIC Leaflet 571-4.
* UIC 596-6 Conveyance of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conditions for coding combined-transport load units and combined-transport lines. The leaflet sets out the coding and organisation of loading units in respect of road vehicles on wagons, designed to ensure compatibility of loading units (LU) with the permissible profile for combined transport lines. The provisions aim to facilitate LU identification to speed-up international traffic movements. They are applicable to semi-trailers, swap bodies, roller units loaded on wagons and bogies in combined transport operations.

The '''International Vaccine Institute''' (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved [[vaccines]]. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.

Created initially as an initiative of the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/seung-il-shin|title=Seung Il Shin - Founder &amp;amp; Board Director @ Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.

[[File:Establishment Agreement Signing.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Signing of the IVI Establishment Agreement]]

=== Foundation ===
In 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969]].

On October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City. Representatives of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by [[Senegal]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

In 1997 more countries followed, with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], and Turkey signing the Agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-3&amp;chapter=9&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the [[Treaty series#United Nations|United Nations Depository of Treaties]] under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP headquarters]] by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. [[Hong Soon-young|Hong Soon-Young]] and IVI Board Chairman, [[Barry Bloom|Dr. Barry Bloom]]. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea,, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. 
[[File:IVI Building (1).jpg|thumb|290x290px|IVI Headquarters]]

=== Headquarters building ===
The IVI headquarters building, located in [[Seoul National University]]’s Research Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was designed by a consortium consisting of [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samwoo Architects]] of South Korea and [https://www.payette.com/ Payette Associates] of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.

== Previous activities ==

=== Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) 2000-2006 ===

IVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[shigellosis]] into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. &amp;nbsp;At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2003-2004|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2005|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea.|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI typhoid ====

The DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to [[Typhoid vaccine|typhoid vaccines]] in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-[[Polysaccharide]] (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: [[Hechi|Heichi]], China; [[Kolkata]], India; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Karachi]], Pakistan; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of [[Paratyphoid fever|paratyphoid A]] infections in China’s [[Guangxi|Guangxi province]], which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI cholera ====

The DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable [[cholera vaccine]] in [[cholera]]-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: [[Matlab (Bangladesh)|Matlab]], Bangladesh; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Kolkata]], India; [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], Mozambique; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s [http://www.vabiotech.com.vn/?lang=en VaBiotech.] At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s [http://nihe.org.vn/en/home-c10902.htm National Institute of Health and Epidemiology] following a technology transfer from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]], was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. 

==== DOMI shigellosis ====
IVI established the DOMI [[Shigellosis]] program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh; [[Hebei]], China; [[Karachi]], Pakistan and neighboring villages; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Nha Trang]], Vietnam; and [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotavirus Diarrhea Program 1999-2010 ===
IVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of [[Rotavirus vaccine|rotavirus vaccines]] in their [[Vaccination schedule|national immunization programs]]. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Vietnam]]. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK’s]] RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa]], Vietnam. &amp;nbsp;In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in [[Nha Trang]] Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2009|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

=== Dengue Vaccine Programs 2002-2016 ===

==== The Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI''')''' ====
The Pediatric [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective [[dengue vaccine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:

* Development of a dengue vaccine partnership and global research network to develop, evaluate, and introduce dengue vaccines. Working with Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institute of Health]], and [[Sanofi Pasteur]], PDVI provided technical advice and support for the efficacy and clinical trials of their respective dengue vaccine candidates and established a consortium of field sites in dengue-endemic countries across Asia and the Americas.
* Establishment of two regional Dengue Prevention Boards in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas to disseminate information and make recommendations regarding the control of dengue through immunization.
* Collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop a free user-friendly software, [http://www.denguevaccine.org/resource-search/?types%5B%5D=2 DenguEcon], which can be used by policymakers to determine the economic impact of dengue.

In 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2011|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI) ====
The successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute|the Sabin Vaccine Institute]], the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the [http://ivac.jhu.edu/ International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[Gabon]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. From 2013-2015, with funding from [[Germany]]’s [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education &amp; Research (BMBF)]], IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]] and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of [[Sanofi|Sanofi Pasteur’s]] Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue &amp; [[Aedes]]-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivi.int/wp-content/uploads/kboard_attached/11/201610/IVI%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf|title=IVI 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ivi.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6/15/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signatory Countries of the IVI ===
As of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)''' as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve '''Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines''', and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)'''. A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.

In short, in addition to the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], 40 countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Liberia]]**, [[Republic of Korea]]**, [[Bhutan]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]]**, [[Mongolia]]**, [[Senegal]], [[China]]**, [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]]**, [[Ecuador]]**, [[Nepal]], [[Sweden]]**, [[Egypt]], [[Netherlands]]**, [[Tajikistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Oman]]**, [[Thailand]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]]**, [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]], [[Panama]], [[Uzbekistan]]**, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vietnam]]**, [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Peru]]**, [[Lebanon]], [[Philippines]]**, [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[India]], [[Kuwait]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivi.int/about_us/signatory_countries.html Governance. 'Signatory Countries.']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
* IVI has developed 3 new or improved vaccines: reformulated oral [[cholera]] vaccine, typhoid Vi [[polysaccharide]] vaccine, and typhoid Vi [[conjugate vaccine]].

[[File:Ipas (Organization) Logo.jpg|thumb|Official Logo for Ipas, Sexual &amp; Reproductive rights organisation ]]
'''Ipas''' is a global [[non-profit organization]] that works to increase women's ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, and to end deaths and injuries from unsafe [[abortion]]. Ipas's work is grounded in the belief that women everywhere must have the opportunity to determine their futures, care for their families and manage their fertility. Through local, national and global partnerships, they work to ensure that women receive safe, respectful and comprehensive abortion care, including counselling and contraception, to prevent future unwanted pregnancies.

==Scope of work==
Ipas works to improve women's access and right to safe [[abortion]] care and [[reproductive health]] services by:

* Training doctors, nurses, and midwives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20638991|year=2010|author1=Akiode|first1=A|title=An evaluation of a national intervention to improve the postabortion care content of midwifery education in Nigeria|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|volume=110|issue=2|pages=186–90|last2=Fetters|first2=T|last3=Daroda|first3=R|last4=Okeke|first4=B|last5=Oji|first5=E|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in clinical and counseling skills for abortion, postabortion care and [[family planning]];

=== Abortion in Nigeria ===
In 2017, Ipas (Nigeria), called for a review of Nigeria's law criminalising abortion in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/ipas-calls-review-law-abortion/|title=Vanguard Article on Nigeria's Abortion Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a workshop covering Woman’s Reproductive Health and Rights in Abuja, Nigeria, Ipas's Country Director spoke out about the issue, saying "Any law that does not recognise or reflect the true situation of the country is a dead law."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; foegal  

==History==
Ipas was founded in 1973, following the passage of the Helms Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/restrictions.html USAID | USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits use of U.S. foreign aid to support abortion services overseas. Ipas began manufacturing and distributing manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) instruments in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalstudentsforchoice.org/uploads/UpdateNewsletter/The%20Ipas%20MVA%20Plus%20%E2%80%93%20An%20Advancement%20in%20Technology-April%202002.doc Medical Students for Choice | The Ipas MVA Plus – An Advancement in Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Ipas launched the postabortion family planning initiative in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2910603.html Guttmacher Institute | Essential Elements of Postabortion Care: Origins, Evolution and Future Directions]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Ipas created, defined and implemented the concept of "woman-centered comprehensive abortion care".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipas.org/Publications/What_is_woman-centered_comprehensive_abortion_care.aspx?ht=what%20is%20woman%20centered%20comprehensive%20abortion%20care%20what%20is%20woman%20centered%20comprehensive%20abortion%20care Ipas | What is woman-centered comprehensive abortion care?]&lt;/ref&gt; Ipas University, a self-paced online learning site for reproductive health care providers, launched in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipasu.org/home/ IpasU]&lt;/ref&gt; Womancare Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ipas, also launched in 2009, to market and distribute the MVA instruments, as well as a number of other reproductive-health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womancareglobal.com/ WomanCare Global]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 Ipas had offices in 13 countries and serves 40 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipas.org/Where_Ipas_Works.aspx Ipas | Where Ipas Works]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Not Yet Rain'' (2009) is a documentary film about abortion in Ethiopia, produced by filmmaker Lisa Russell and Ipas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministing.com/archives/015924.html Feministing | Not Yet Rain: A new documentary about abortion access in Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal of World History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that presents historical analysis from a global point of view, focusing especially on forces that cross the boundaries of [[culture]]s and [[civilization]]s, including large-scale population movements, economic fluctuations, transfers of [[technology]], the spread of [[infectious disease]]s, long-distance trade, and the spread of [[religious faith]]s, ideas, and values.

The journal was established in 1990 by [[Jerry H. Bentley]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]] to serve as the official journal of the [[World History Association]]. It is published by the [[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press]]. Initially produced twice a year, it became a quarterly in 2003.

In 2000, it was included in [[Project MUSE]], which now contains archives going back to vol. 7 (1996). In 2009, it was included in [[JSTOR]], with a [[moving wall]] of 3 years.

The '''KOF Index of Globalisation''' is an [[List of globalization-related indices|index]] of the degree of [[globalisation]] of 122 countries.{{r|axel|page=29}} It was conceived by [[Axel Dreher]] at the Konjunkturforschungsstelle of [[ETH Zurich]], in Switzerland. It was first published in 2002, and covered the period from 1970 until that year.{{r|marco|page=46}} A new version of it was published in 2017.{{r|axel|page=29}}

The index is based on three principal criteria: economic, political and social.{{r|marco|page=46}} Unlike the [[Maastricht Globalisation Index]], it does not take into account [[Environmental quality|environmental]] factors.{{r|axel|page=29}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18361">The '''largest known prime number''' ({{as of|2018|November|lc=y}}) is 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, a number with 23,249,425 digits. It was found by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) in 2017.&lt;ref name="M77232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M77232917.html|title=50th Known Mersenne Prime Discovered|website=www.mersenne.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digits in largest prime 2016.svg|thumb|400px|Plot of the number of digits in largest known prime by year, since the electronic computer. The vertical scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. The red line is the exponential curve of [[Curve fitting|best fit]]: ''y'' = exp(0.187394 ''t'' - 360.527), where ''t'' is in years.]]

[[Euclid]] [[Euclid's theorem|proved that]] there is no largest [[prime number]], and many mathematicians and hobbyists continue to search for large prime numbers.

Many of the largest known primes are [[Mersenne prime]]s. {{As of|2018|July}}, the seven largest known primes are Mersenne primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php?Number=100 |title=The largest known primes - Database Search Output |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last sixteen record primes were Mersenne primes.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html |title=The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The last non-Mersenne to be the largest known prime, was [http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=390 391,581 ⋅ 2&lt;sup&gt;216,193&lt;/sup&gt; − 1]; see also [http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History] by Caldwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] implementation of the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] for [[Mersenne number]]s is fast compared to other known primality tests for other kinds of numbers.

==Current record==
The record is currently held by 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 with 23,249,425 digits, found by [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|GIMPS]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="M77232"/&gt; Its value is:

==Prizes==
The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) currently offers a US$3000 research discovery award for participants who download and run their free software and whose computer discovers a new Mersenne prime having fewer than 100 million digits.

There are several prizes offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for record primes.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt; GIMPS is also coordinating its long-range search efforts for primes of 100 million digits and larger and will split the Electronic Frontier Foundation's US$150,000 prize with a winning participant.

The record passed one million digits in 1999, earning a US$50,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation, [https://www.eff.org/press/releases/big-prime-nets-big-prize Big Prime Nets Big Prize].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the record passed ten million digits, earning a US$100,000 prize and a [[Cooperative Computing Award]] from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0 |title=Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize |date=October 14, 2009 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it the 29th-top invention of 2008.&lt;ref name="invention"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854157,00.html |title=Best Inventions of 2008 - 29.

Additional prizes are being offered for the first prime number found with at least one hundred million digits and the first with at least one billion digits.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt;

==History==
The following table lists the progression of the largest known prime number in ascending order.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"/&gt; Here M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is the [[Mersenne number]] with exponent ''n''. The longest record-holder known was M&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; = 524,287, which was the largest known prime for 144 years. No records are known before 1456.

A '''list of antibiotic resistant bacteria''' is provided below. These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or [[antimicrobial resistance]]).

== Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) ==
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1}}
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. In Indian hospitals [[hospital-acquired infection]]s are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, this can make them dangerous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Timothy R|last2=Weeks|first2=Janis|last3=Livermore|first3=David M|last4=Toleman|first4=Mark A|title=Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309911700597|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=11|issue=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(11)70059-7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were NDM-1-positive indicates widespread infection in New Delhi already back in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NDM-1 was first detected in a ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' isolate from a [[Sweden|Swedish]] patient of [[India]]n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/13/new_drug_resistant_superbugs_found_in_3_states/ |title=New drug-resistant superbugs found in 3 states|author=Marilynn Marchione|date=13 September 2010|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/about/healthzone.html|title=Superbug detected in GTA|author=Madeleine White|date=21 August 2010|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/08/japan_confirms_first_case_of_superbug_gene/|title=Japan confirms first case of superbug gene|last=Yuasa|first=Shino|date=8 September 2010|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that ''C. difficile'' infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html|title=CDC Press Releases|website=CDC|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (multidrug-resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Co-evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens, Brites, D., &amp; Gagneux, S.

Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J.

TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug.

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'']] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=== Gamma proteobacteria ===

==== Enterobacteriaceae ====
As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of [[Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae|carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae]] (CRE), also known as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=====''Klebsiella pneumoniae''=====
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|KPC]])-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Corey|last2=Bent|first2=Zachary|last3=Meagher|first3=Robert|last4=Williams|first4=Kelly|date=June 7, 2014|title=Resistance Determinants and Mobile Genetic Elements of an NDM-1-Encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099209|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e99209|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099209|pmc=4048246|pmid=24905728}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbapenem]] antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnold RS, Thom KA, Sharma S, Phillips M, Kristie Johnson J, Morgan DJ|year=2011|title=Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=104|issue=1|pages=40–5|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181fd7d5a|pmc=3075864|pmid=21119555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''=====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]]. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name="Davies2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Davies J, Davies D|year=2010|title=Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|volume=74|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-10|pmc=2937522|pmid=20805405|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adam M, Murali B, Glenn NO, Potter SS|year=2008|title=Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria|journal=BMC Evol.

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrohistory''' seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often "assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew C. Wells, Ph.D., ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110824015142/http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf Parallelism: A Handbook of Social Analysis]''. Archived August 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Oswald Spengler]]'s assertion that the lifespan of [[civilization]]s is limited and ultimately they decay, and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} as it marked the high water point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Modern history''', the '''modern period''' or the '''modern era''', is the linear, global, [[historiography|historiographical]] approach to the time frame after [[post-classical history]].&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the [[English language]], "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval; modern history is the history of the world since the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814|title=The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia|publisher=|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into periods:

In the pre-modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a [[faith]] in some form of [[deity]], be it that in a single [[God]] or in many [[gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Tirosh-Samuelson, H.

Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person. It was only through these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the [[Divinity|divine]].

===Modern===

The term ''modern'' was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times (ultimately derived from the Latin adverb ''modo'', meaning "just now").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/modern|website=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European [[Renaissance]] (c. 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and Early Modern times, started in Italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the [[Age of Discovery]] and the invention of the [[telescope]] and [[microscope]], expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.

In contrast to the pre-modern era, [[Western world|Western civilization]] made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when [[scientific method]]s were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of [[mythology|myth]] under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via [[empirical observation]],&lt;ref&gt;Baird, F.E., &amp; Kaufmann, W.A. (2008). ''Philosophic classics: From Plato to Derrida''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; versus the historic use of [[reason]] and [[innate knowledge]].

The term ''Early Modern'' was introduced in the English language in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of the History of ideas'', Volume 5, Detroit 2005. Modernism and Modern&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the time between what has been called the [[Middle Ages]] and time of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (1800) (when the meaning of the term ''Modern Ages'' was developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms stem from European history. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in Asia, and in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], the terms are applied in a very different way, but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_14.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Late Medieval and Early Modern Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary ===

{{Main|Contemporary history}}
In the Contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the [[Information Age]] and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life. The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the [[European Union]] and [[Russia|Russian Federation]] were two forces recently developed. A concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.

== Modern era ==
=== Significant developments ===

The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of [[science]], [[politics]], [[warfare]], and [[technology]]. It has also been an [[age of discovery]] and [[globalization]]. During this time, the [[power (international)|European powers]] and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural [[colonization]] of the rest of the world.

By the late 19th and 20th centuries, [[modernist]] art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]], but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of [[individualism]],&lt;ref name="NCEref"&gt;''National, cultural, and ethnic identities: harmony beyond conflict'' by Jaroslav Hroch, David Hollan&lt;/ref&gt; [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism and modernity: the great debate'' by Jack Goody&lt;/ref&gt; [[urbanization]]&lt;ref name="NCEref" /&gt; and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9Ha1fmAXk4C ''Progress and its discontents''] American Academy of Arts and Sciences. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ov86j30F96EC&amp;pg=PA297 Technology and politics]." Western Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A companion to the philosophy of technology'' by Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen, Stig Andur Pedersen, Vincent F. Hendricks&lt;/ref&gt;

Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx, Durkheim, Weber: formations of modern social thought'' by Kenneth L. Morrison. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Schweiker, ''The Blackwell companion to religious ethics''. 2005. p. 454. (cf., "In modernity, however, much of economic activity and theory seemed to be entirely cut off from religious and ethical norms, at least in traditional terms. Many see modern economic developments as entirely secular.")&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by [[postmodernism]] while the dominance of Western Europe and [[Anglo-America]] over other continents has been criticized by [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]].

One common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of [[movable type]]&lt;ref&gt;''Early European History'' by [[Henry Kitchell Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformations'' by [[Carter Lindberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the "modern" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''The new Cambridge modern history: Companion volume'' by Peter Burke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Plains Indian History and Culture: Essays on Continuity and Change'' by John C. Ewers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weber, irrationality, and social order'' by Alan Sica&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early ====
{{Main|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* The [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* The Rise of [[capitalism]]
* The [[Golden Age of Piracy]]

Important events in the early modern period include:
* The invention of the [[printing press]]
* The [[English Civil War]]
* The [[Seven Years' War]]

|&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Modern Age characteristics&lt;/div&gt;
The concept of the modern world as distinct from an ancient or medieval world rests on a sense that the modern world is not just another [[era]] in history, but rather the result of a new type of change. This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation.

Advances in all areas of human activity—[[politics]], [[industry]], [[society]], [[economics]], [[commerce]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[mechanization]], [[automation]], [[science]], [[medicine]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]—appear to have transformed an ''Old World'' into the ''Modern'' or ''New World''.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern"&gt;''Contemporary history of the world'' by Edwin Augustus Grosvenor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson"&gt;''A summary of modern history'' by Jules Michelet, Mary Charlotte Mair Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old-fashioned from the modern.&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;

Portions of the Modern world altered its relationship with the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[value system]], revalued the [[monarchy|monarchical]] government system, and abolished the [[feudalism|feudal]] economic system, with new [[democracy|democratic]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas in the areas of [[politics]], [[science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="GrosvenorModern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MicheletAndSimpson" /&gt;
|}
This combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.

As an [[Age of Revolution]]s dawned, beginning with those revolts in [[American Revolution|America]] and [[French Revolution|France]], political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, C.W. (1965). [[Cambridge Modern History|The new Cambridge modern history]]. Volume 9., ''War and peace in an age of upheaval, 1793–1830''.

New York: Gotham Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the peace established by [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Charles Downer (1910). ''Europe since 1815''. American historical series, H. Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late ====
As a result of the Industrial Revolution and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]
* [[Total fertility rate]]s and [[ecological collapse]]s occurring at [[exponential growth|geometric rates]];

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[American Revolution]]
* The [[French Revolution]]
* The [[Colonization of Australia]]
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]
* The [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]

Our most recent era{{mdash}}Modern Times{{mdash}}begins with the end of these revolutions in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Duruy, V., &amp; Grosvenor, E.A. (1894). ''History of modern times: From the fall of Constantinople to the French revolution''. New York: H. Holt and company.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the World Wars era&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. (2001). ''Modern times: The world from the twenties to the nineties''. New York: HarperPerennial.&lt;/ref&gt; (encompassing [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) and the emergence of [[socialism|socialist countries]] that led to the [[Cold War]]. The ''contemporary era'' follows shortly afterward with the explosion of research and increase of knowledge known as the [[Information Age]] in the latter 20th and the early 21st century. Today's [[Postmodernity|Postmodern]] era is seen in widespread [[digitality]].&lt;ref&gt;Martín Lister, ''New media: a critical introduction''. Psychology Press, 2003. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early modern period ==
{{Main|Early modern period}}
Historians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800. It follows the Late Middle Ages and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.

The expansion of Islam took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mughal Empire]] existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.

Various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. In the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Empire]] and cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. In the west, kingdoms of Europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion. Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.

Later religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned Muslim expansion. Christians and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and the [[Protestant Reformation]] took place.
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|centre|thumb|upright=3.4|{{center|Colonial empires in 1800}}]]
During the early modern period, an [[age of discovery]] and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.

In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the later Ming Dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1000ce_mingvoyages.htm#decision|title=The Ming Voyages {{!}} Asia for Educators {{!}} Columbia University|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite isolationist policies the Ming Economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish New World]] silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as [[Portuguese Macau|Macao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115ch8.html|title=Chapter 8 The New World|website=mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect [[Joseon|Korea]] from [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=168–169|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] dynasty, by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]]. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, "A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], art flourished in the Edo Period]]
In pre-modern&lt;ref&gt;or early-modern&lt;/ref&gt; Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of "warring states", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[shōgun]]'' in 1603.
Society in the Japanese "[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908–1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimyōs'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimyōs'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.

On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mughals.html|title=Manas: History and Politics, Mughals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "classic period" ended with the death and defeat of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707 by the rising [[Hindu]] Maratha Empire,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_1.shtml|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2010|location=London|at=Section 5: Aurangzeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.

===== British and Dutch colonization =====

The development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]

The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] and consequent of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the [[India Office|British government]] assumed the task of directly administering India in the new [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 [[Stamford Raffles]] established [[Singapore]] as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.

The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman. ''Early modern British history, 1485–1760: a select bibliography'', [[Historical Association]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/rr_gateway/research_guides/history/texts_by_period.shtml#emp ''Early Modern Period (1485–1800)''], Sites Organized by Period, [[Rutgers University]] Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early modern Europe]]an history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century, through the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.
[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]
In 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

==== Reason and Enlightenment ====
{{Further|Great Divergence}}
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|left|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach – Mass in B minor – Agnus Dei, From 1724]]
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright=1|"If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it." An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; [[Truth]] (center) is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]|alt=]]

Traditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The [[Age of Reason]] in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of [[modern philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; and a departure from the medieval approach, especially [[Scholasticism]]. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] is a time in [[Western philosophy]] and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of [[scholasticism]] with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-consciously imitated [[classical Latin]] and deprecated the use of [[medieval Latin]]. By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning.[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.|alt=|147x147px|left]]The [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] was a [[literature|literary]] and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the [[Académie française]]. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (''Anciens'') who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the Moderns (''Modernes''), who supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

==== Scientific Revolution ====
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
The Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in [[classical physics]], [[classical astronomy|astronomy]], [[classical biology|biology]], [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|human anatomy]], [[classical chemistry|chemistry]], and other [[classical science]]s were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from [[Ancient Greece]] to the Middle Ages which would lead to a transition to [[modern science]]. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]], in institutions supporting [[scientific investigation]], and in the more [[worldview|widely held picture of the universe]]. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.

==== The French Revolutions ====
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''La liberté guidant le peuple''. The [[French Revolution]] inspired a wave of revolutions across Europe. [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]
{{Main|French Revolution}}
Toward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, changing to forms based on Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].

The changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.

===== National and Legislative Assembly =====
{{Main|National Assembly (French Revolution)|Legislative Assembly (France)}}
During the French Revolution, the National Assembly, which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.

===== The Directory and Napoleonic Era =====
[[File:Baron Antoine-Jean Gros-Battle Pyramids 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] 1810 by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros]]
{{Main|French Directory|Napoleonic Era}}
The Executive Directory was a body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. Napoleon, before seizing the title of Emperor, was elected as First Consul of the Consulate of France.

The campaigns of French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte characterized the Napoleonic Era. Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and "Glorious" surge of [[Republicanism]].

==== Italian unification ====
[[File:Gioacchino toma roma o morte 1863.jpg|left|thumb|''Rome or Death,'' Italian Patriotic Painting, 1863]]

[[Italian unification]] was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, and approximately ended with the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, though the last ''[[Italia irredenta|città irredente]]'' did not join the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] until after World War I.

==== End of the early modern period ====
Toward the end of the early modern period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later.

The end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern Europe.

=== North America ===
{{Main|European colonization of the Americas}}[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the five-man committee in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]

The [[French and Indian Wars]] were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other.

The expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war, there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (also called American War of Independence).

[[File:North America 1797 - U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1909.jpg|left|thumb|right|North America 1797]]

The American Revolution began with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claim to the United States with the Treaty of Paris.

The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set up the current United States; the [[United States Constitution]] ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.

==== Decolonization of North and South Americas ====
{{Main|Decolonization of the Americas|Spanish American wars of independence}}The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

When the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the [[Empire of Brazil]].

=== Industrial revolutions ===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM]]

The development of the [[steam engine]] started the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Watt steam engine]] image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM ([[Madrid]])&lt;/ref&gt; The steam engine was created to pump water from coal mines, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels. The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that it "broke out" in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd.  {{ISBN|0349104840}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[T.S. Ashton]] held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], The [[English Regency|Regency]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E Inikori.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521010799&amp;id=y7rhKYWhCyIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;sig=zOPr9UkQv258KyhCkuFM0abERnI  ''Africans and the Industrial Revolution in England''], Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521010799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The great changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas, religion or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people.

The first Industrial Revolution merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[electric power]] generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.

==== Industrialization ====
[[Industrialization]] is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It is a subdivision of a more general [[modernization]] process, where [[social change]] and [[economic development]] are closely related with [[innovation|technological innovation]], particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their [[nature|perception of nature]].

==== Revolution in manufacture and power ====
[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|[[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830, world's first railway.]]
An [[economic system|economy]] based on [[manual labour]] was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the [[textile]] industries and the development of [[iron]]-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads, and then [[rail transport|railways]].

The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by [[coal]]) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Business and Economics.  [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0195115899&amp;id=CX9kBaVx4JkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=V0eO27c7koD8rrIV2EKv6-guB5s  ''Leading Issues in Economic Development''], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0195115899}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.

The modern [[petroleum industry]] started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining [[kerosene]] from [[coal]] by [[Nova Scotia]]n [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]]. [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil" ("petr-oleum") [[seep]]s in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the following year. In 1854, [[Benjamin Silliman]], a science professor at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.

==== Notable engineers ====
[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Nikola Tesla with his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York|alt=|193x193px]]

Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, [[Lewis Paul]] was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]]'s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.

In the latter part of the second revolution, [[Thomas Alva Edison]] developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched on the world's first large-scale [[electrical supply network]] that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, [[Nikola Tesla]] made many contributions in the field of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==== Social effects and classes ====
The Industrial Revolutions were major [[technology|technological]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], and [[culture|cultural]] changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on [[society]] was enormous and is often compared to the [[Neolithic revolution]], when mankind developed [[agriculture]] and gave up its [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Brown, Lester. [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1853839043&amp;id=5aCyfUsHM6kC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;sig=1dsUat9P_-9dWWVRMpPt1udT8DQ ''Eco-Economy''], James &amp; James, Earthscan. {{ISBN|1853839043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127032512/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |date=2007-11-27 }} retrieved March 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mid-19th-century European revolts =====
[[File:Alexanderplatz Berlin 1848.jpg|left|thumb|[[Revolutions of 1848|German Revolution]], Berlin 1848]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]], known in some countries as the Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848, soon spread to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cayley, E.S. (1856). ''The European revolutions of 1848''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. Vol. I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, S.B., &amp; Hart, A.B. (1918). ''New medieval and modern history''. New York: American book company.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the revolutions were quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas, with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching.

===== Industrial age reformism =====
Industrial age [[reform movement]]s began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian, socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal reform, prison reform, and public sanitation.

Following the Enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the [[Scientific Revolution]] and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.

==== Imperial Russia ====
{{Main|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Russian Peasant Girls-retouched.jpg|thumb|Russian Peasant Girls, 1900]]
Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=978-5170021420|accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's ''Window to Europe''. [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (''the Great''), who ruled in 1762–96, extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward and southward.  Russia would [[Russian conquest of Siberia|colonize]] the vast Asian lands of [[Siberia]] expanding by land to the Pacific Coast of Asia, and [[Russian America|North America]].  As the large realm embraced [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchy]] Russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors. In the 19th century, Russia was invaded by France in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards. Nonetheless industrialization did not come to Russia until the 1870s. The Medieval practice of serfdom was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished]] in 1861 freeing over thirty million Russian peasants. A market economy finally emerged in the Russian Empire. However class warfare rose, and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

=== European dominance and the 19th century ===
{{Main|19th century|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
Historians define the 19th century [[List of time periods|historical era]] as stretching from 1815 (the [[Congress of Vienna]]) to 1914 (the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]). Alternatively, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] defined the [[The long 19th century|"Long Nineteenth Century"]] as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.

==== Imperialism and empires ====

[[File:World heads of state in 1889.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|alt=Painting of a group of standing and seated heads of state in a variety of national uniforms and formal dress|"The World's Sovereigns", 1889]]

In the 1800s and early 1900s, once great and powerful Empires such as Spain, Ottoman Turkey, the Mughal Empire, and the Kingdom of Portugal began to break apart. Spain, which was at one time unrivaled in Europe, had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Sensing the time was right, Spain's vast colonies in South America began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the Spanish territories gaining their independence.

The once mighty Ottoman Empire was wracked with a series of revolutions, resulting with the Ottoman's only holding a small region that surrounded the capital, Istanbul.

[[File:Imperalism.xcf|left|thumb|Montage that depicts European wars of imperialism. By clockwise, wars include [[French conquest of Algeria|French Algerian War]], [[First Opium War|Opium War]], [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian Conquest of Central Asia]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu War]]]]
The Mughal empire, which was descended from the Mongol Khanate, was bested by the upcoming [[Maratha Confederacy]]. All was going well for the [[Maratha]]s until the British took an interest in the riches of India and the British ended up ruling not just the boundaries of Modern India, but also Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh and some Southern Regions of Afghanistan.

The King of Portugal's vast territory of Brazil reformed into the independent Empire of Brazil. With the defeat of Napoleonic France, Britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world, and by the end of the First World War controlled a Quarter of the world's population and a third of its surface. However, the power of the British Empire did not end on land, since it had the greatest navy on the planet. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to become a great [[Power (international)|international power]] that raced to create empires of its own.

The [[Meiji Restoration]] was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the [[Meiji Era]] which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] of [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and made [[Imperial Japan]] a [[great power]]. [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive [[rebellion]]s and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century.

European powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French [[New Caledonia]] from 1853 and [[French Polynesia]] from 1889; the Germans established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900. The United States expanded into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] from 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].

==== British Victorian era ====
{{Main|British Empire|Victorian era}}[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps|alt=|left]]The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]].
[[File:Fleet Street. By James Valentine c.1890..jpg|alt=Fleet Street in London, 1890.|thumb|Fleet Street in London capital of the [[British Empire]], 1890]]
In Britain's "imperial century",&lt;ref&gt;For more, see [[Pax Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'', and a foreign policy of "[[splendid isolation]]". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been generally characterized as "[[informal empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. T. (2004). ''Informal empire: Mexico and Central America in Victorian culture''. Minneapolis, Minn: Univ. of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Of note during this time was the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the [[Zulu Empire]].

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]]. Growing until 1922, around {{convert|13000000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus (2001).

''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire''. Penguin. {{ISBN|1594200130}}. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The British established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and [[Colonial Fiji|Fiji]] in 1872, with much of [[Oceania]] becoming part of the British Empire.

==== French governments and conflicts ====
The [[Bourbon Restoration]] followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The [[July Monarchy]] was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|left|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]]]]
The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a conflict between France and Prussia, while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was a member, and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.

The [[French Third Republic]] was the republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire following the defeat of Louis-Napoléon in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien Régime in the French Revolution of 1789.

==== Slavery and abolition ====
[[File:Une Dame d´une Fortune Ordinaire dans son Intérieur au Milieu de ses Habitudes Journalières, by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1823.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Slavery]] in [[Brazil]], before 1823]]
{{Main|Abolitionism}}
[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], Britain forced the [[Barbary pirates]] to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, [[Slavery Abolition Act|banned slavery throughout its domain]], and charged its navy with ending the global [[slave trade]]. Slavery was then abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]], [[Emancipation Proclamation|America]], and [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]].

==== African colonization ====
{{Main|Colonisation of Africa}}

Following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation, the [[Scramble for Africa]] was initiated formally at the [[Berlin West Africa Conference]] in 1884–1885. The Berlin Conference attempted to avoid war among the European powers by allowing the European rival countries to carve up the continent of Africa into national colonies. Africans were not consulted.

The major European powers laid claim to the areas of [[Africa]] where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national [[colony]]. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice. There were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native Africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under European colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as "hell on earth."
[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|left|thumb|European officials staking claims to [[Africa]] in the [[Congress of Berlin]] ]]
At the time of the [[Berlin Conference]], Africa contained one-fifth of the world’s population living in one-quarter of the world’s land area. However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included [[Cape Colony]] (Great Britain), [[Angola]] (Portugal), and [[Algeria]] (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained uncharted, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.

From the 1880s to 1914, the European powers expanded their control across the African continent, competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources. [[Great Britain]] controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The [[France|French]] gained major ground in West Africa, and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] held colonies in southern Africa. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]] established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]] (ruled from 1865 to 1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], which became his personal fiefdom. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. [[Liberia]], which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe, Volume Two: From the French Revolution to the Present'', Third Edition (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;819–859&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meiji Japan ====
{{Main|Meiji period}}
[[File:View of Kobe LACMA M.91.377.8.jpg|left|thumb|Kobe Japan and its harbor, 1865. Hand colored.]] Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[Meiji era]] occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This [[Japanese era name|era name]] means "Enlightened Rule". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Pyle, "Profound Forces in the Making of Modern Japan", ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2006) 32#2 pp. 393–418 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jjs/summary/v032/32.2pyle01.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|hyobusho]] (war office) was replaced with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|War Department]] and a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Naval Department.]] The [[samurai]] class suffered great disappointment the following years.

Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their ''daimyōs'', initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki ("blood tax") literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. Japan's modernized military gave Japan the opportunity to engage in Imperialism with its victory against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan annexed [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and the Chinese province of [[Shandong|Shangdong]].

After the death of the Meiji Emperor, the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] took the throne, the[[Taishō period]] was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all Japanese men. Foreigners would instrumental in aiding in Japan's modernization.  A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] in this period was [[Ernest Mason Satow]].

[[File:Westward the Course of Empire.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way'' (1861).]]
The [[Antebellum Age]] was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and in the western territories of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]] that eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861. The Antebellum Period is often considered to have begun with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} although it may have begun as early as 1812. This period is also significant because it marked the transition of American manufacturing to the industrial revolution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

"[[Manifest destiny]]" was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—"from sea to shining sea"—largely defining the borders of the contiguous United States as they are today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{Main|American Civil War|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
The American Civil War began when seven [[Slave state|Southern slave states]] declared their [[secession]] from the U.S. and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], the Confederacy (four more states joinged the Confederacy later). Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], they fought against the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S. federal government (the Union)]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]], which was supported by all the free states and the five [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] in the north.

Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vickysburg]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General [[Robert E. Lee]] proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] in 1864–65. The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77) began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation proclamation]] in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and voting rights for Southern blacks. It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.

==== The Gilded Age and legacy ====
{{Main|Gilded Age}}

[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|1902 New York City in early [[skyscraper]]s]]

During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] created industrial towns and cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial [[working class]] which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialists and financiers called the "robber barons"]]. An example is the company of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, [[Standard Oil]] absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.

The creation of a modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a [[Infrastructure|transportation and communication infrastructure]], the [[corporation]] became the dominant form of business organization and a [[Management|managerial revolution]] transformed [[business]] operations. In 1890, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase "restraint of trade" remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and [[industrial production]] in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form [[labor union]]s despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" [[monopoly]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States'', 221 U.S. 1 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science and philosophy ===

In biology, [[Darwinism]] gained acceptance, promoting the concept of [[adaptation]] in the theory of [[natural selection]]. The fields of [[modern geology|geology]], [[modern astronomy|astronomy]] and [[modern psychology|psychology]] also made strides and gained new insights. In [[modern medicine|medicine]], there were advances in [[medical theory]] and [[medical treatment|treatments]].

Starting one-hundred years before the 20th century, the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment spiritual philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters around the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Adams Cram]].

These ideas were challenged, for example by the [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]], who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of [[human rights]]), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than a secular version of [[theism]]. In his ''[[Genealogy of Morals]]'', he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.

==== Notable persons ====
[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Albert Einstein in 1921|alt=]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] is renowned for his redefinition of [[sexual desire]] as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]], his [[transference|theory of transference]] in the therapeutic relationship, and the [[Dream interpretation|interpretation of dreams]] as sources of insight into [[unconscious desire]]s.

[[Albert Einstein]] is known for his theories of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. He also made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]], especially his mathematical treatment of [[Brownian motion]], his resolution of the [[Einstein solid|paradox of specific heats]], and his connection of [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|fluctuations and dissipation]]. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, [[quantum field theory]], primarily through his theoretical studies of the [[photon]].

==== Social Darwinism ====
At the end of the 19th century, [[Social Darwinism]] was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a "natural" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the "[[survival of the fittest]]", the term was in fact coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] and referred to in "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" written by [[Andrew Carnegie]].

==== Marxist society ====
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]], produced in the United States|alt=|left]]
[[Karl Marx]] summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848). He wrote:
:''The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of [[class struggle]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;In the 1888 English edition of the ''Communist Manifest'', [[Friedrich Engels]] added a footnote with the commentary: "That is, all written history. In 1847, the prehistory of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, was all but unknown. Since then Haxthausen discovered common ownership of land In Russia, Maurer concluded it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and by and by village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The Inner organization of this primitive Communistic society was laid bare, In its typical form, by Morgan's work on the true nature of the gens and Its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of these primaeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempte to retrace this process of dissolution in "''[[Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthums und des Staats]]''"", from Marx, Karl, Friedrich Engels, Leon Trotsky, and Karl Marx. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEyEzazZKwIC&amp;pg=PA46 The Communist Manifesto and Its Relevance for Today]''. Chippendale, N.S.W.: Resistance Books, 1998. p. 46, see also ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7s0oTEWB_MC&amp;pg=PA204 Cornelius Castoriadis, Political and Social Writings]''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Manifesto'' went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general, [[Marxism]] identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive Communism]]: as seen in cooperative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] Society: which develops when the tribe becomes a city-state. Aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocracy is the ruling class. Merchants develop into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the true working class.
# [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]: workers gain class consciousness, [[Proletarian revolution|overthrow]] the capitalists and take control over the [[Socialist state|state]].
# [[Communism]]: a [[classless society|classless]] and [[stateless society]].

[[File:Australia 1900.jpg|thumb|Though still tied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] [[Australia]] achieved peaceful independence in 1901.|alt=]]
Major political developments saw the former [[British Empire]] lose most of its remaining political power over [[British Commonwealth|commonwealth]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably by dividing the British crown into several sovereignties by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[patriation]] of constitutions by the [[Canada Act 1982]] and the [[Australia Act 1986]], and by the independence of countries such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], two world wars, and the [[Cold War]].

==== Australian Constitution ====
In 1901, the [[Federation of Australia]] was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, the colonies collectively became [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].

==== Revolution and Warlords in China ====

The picture above is [[Nanjing Road]] after the uprising, hung with the [[Five Races Under One Union]] Flags then used by the revolutionaries.|alt=|left]]
The last days of the [[Qing dynasty]] were marked with civil unrest, [[Hundred Days' Reform|failed reforms]] and foreign invasions such as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer rebellion]]. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution.

The assertions of Chinese philosophy&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Enlightenment. By Vera Schwarcz. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century

In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in [[Nanjing]] as the first [[President of the Republic of China|Provisional President]]. But power in [[Beijing]] already had passed to [[Yuan Shikai]], who had effective control of the [[Beiyang Army]], the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent [[civil war]] and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

After the early 20th century revolutions, shifting alliances of [[Warlord era (China)|China's regional warlords]] waged war for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the [[Beiyang government]]. The warlord era ended around 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, W.A. (2010). ''Politics in China: An introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Yalu River 1904.jpg|thumb|The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was the first time a European Country was defeated by an Asian Country in modern times. The Japanese Victory shocked the world.|alt=]]
In 1900 the World's Population had approached approximately 1.6 billion.
Four years into the 20th century saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] establishing the [[Empire of Japan]] as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a [[warm water port]] on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the [[Russian Empire]] was fought against the Japanese over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]]. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Mukden]], and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.

The [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected.  It included [[terrorism]], worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Constitution of 1906]]&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]], and the [[multi-party system]].

In China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The Xinhai Revolution began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of [[Emperor Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the [[Tongmenghui|Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui).

===== Edwardian Britain =====
[[File:Steamship Titanic.jpg|thumb|The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was the largest ship constructed in its time. Deemed invincible, it was sunk by [[iceberg]]s off the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada.]] |alt=|left]]
The [[Edwardian era]] in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. In the early years of the period, the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]] the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the [[House of Lords]], which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the [[People's Budget]] led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910. The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January that year]] returned a [[hung parliament]] with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Irish Nationalist]] members.

===== World War I =====
{{Main|World War I}}

The [[causes of World War I]] included many factors, including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war. The [[Triple Entente]] was the name given to the loose alignment between the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907.  The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the United States, and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], constituted a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of Austria.

However, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the [[Baghdad Railway]] which was planned to connect the [[Ottoman Empire]] cities of [[Konya]] and [[Baghdad]] with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;([[Morris Jastrow, Jr.|Jastrow]] 1917)&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The [[Balkan Wars]] were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the [[Balkan League]] (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], led by the [[Britain in World War I|British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], Russia until March 1918, Japan and the United States after 1917, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the [[Triple Entente]], and the Central Powers are referred to as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].

[[File:Chemical Warfare in the Twentieth Century Q54781.jpg|left|thumb|[[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] was used for the first time in WWI. Soldiers used [[Gas mask|gas-masks]] to protect themselves]]Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a "[[No man's land]]") running from the [[North Sea]] to the border of Switzerland. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large.  Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide [[Spanish flu|influenza outbreak]] at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=John M.|authorlink=John M.

Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations.&lt;ref&gt;Roderic H.

The [[League of Nations]] granted France mandates over [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and granted the United Kingdom mandates over [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] (which was later divided into two regions: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]).

The Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established. In October 1917, a [[October Revolution|''red'' faction revolution]] occurred in which the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of [[Saint Petersburg]] (then known as [[Petrograd]]) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former [[Russian Empire]].

Another action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between Russia and the Central Powers at [[Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Mawdsley (2008) ''The Russian Civil War'': 42&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition for peace, the treaty by the [[Central Powers]] conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [[nationalist]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. The Bolsheviks made peace with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]], as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].  The [[Triple Entente|Western Allies]] expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:
# the withdrawal of Russia from the war effort,
# worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, and
# galvanized by the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good their threats to assume no responsibility for, and so default on, Imperial Russia's massive [[External debt|foreign loans]].&lt;ref&gt;the legal notion of [[Odious debt]] had not yet been formulated&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Russian civil war posters.png|left|thumb|Two contrasting visions of the [[Russian Civil War]]. To the left is propaganda from the [[White Army]], to the right is propaganda from the [[Bolsheviks]]. ]]
In addition, there was a concern, shared by many [[Central Powers]] as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 Cover Story: Churchill's Greatness.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004110408/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=282 |date=2006-10-04 }} Interview with Jeffrey Wallin. (The Churchill Centre)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian provisional government]] collapsed and the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviets]] under the domination of the [[Bolshevik]] party assumed power, first in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd (St. Petersburg)]] and then in other places. In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Christopher, ''From Tsar to Soviets'', Oxford University Press (1996), p. 237: By 1920, 77% of the Red Army's enlisted ranks were composed of peasant conscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Beryl, ''The Russian Revolution 1917–1921'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

[[File:Vladivostok intervention.jpg|thumb|In the Russian Civil War, over eleven nations intervened in favor of the [[White Movement]]. Here Japanese occupy [[Vladivostok]].]]
The principal fighting occurred between the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the forces of the [[White Movement|White Army]]. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Forces]], yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist [[Green armies|Green Army]], the Ukrainian anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and [[Black Guards]], and warlords such as [[Ungern von Sternberg]]. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied [[Vladivostok]], previously held by the [[Provisional Priamur Government]]. The last enclave of the White Forces was the [[Ayano-Maysky District]] on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in the [[Crimea]], but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., [[Kronstadt Uprising]], [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Basmachi Revolt]], and the final resistance of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]).

While the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary Russia and Central Asia, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen [[Russian Empire]]. Revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] died of natural causes and was succeeded by [[Joseph Stalin]].

==== The Early Republic of China ====

In 1917, China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. The [[New Culture Movement]] occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike.
[[File:Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2.jpg|left|thumb|Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2]]

The [[May Fourth Movement]] helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 [[Sun Yat-sen]] had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in [[Guangzhou]] in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).[[File:Sino-german cooperation.png|thumb|With [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941]], Chinese industry and military was improved just prior to the war against Japan.|alt=|150x150px]]

In early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to [[Wuhan]]. But [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Northern Expedition]] was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in [[April 12 Incident|April 1927]].

The interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the Second World War. This period was marked by turmoil in much of the world, as Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War.[[File:A flapper girl LCCN2012645724.tif|thumb|227x227px|American, Flapper Girl.

The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The ''Roaring Twenties'', often called "[[Jazz Age|The Jazz Age]]", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. "[[Normalcy]]" returned to politics, [[jazz music]] blossomed, the [[flapper]] redefined modern womanhood, [[Art Deco]] peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].[[File:I Got The Ritz From The One I Love.ogg|left|thumb|''I got the Ritz from the one I love,'' Jazz music radio broadcast 1932]]
Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation]] of 1923 and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, [[economic development]] soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the "[[Golden Twenties]]". In France and francophone Canada, they were also called the "''années folles''" ("Crazy Years")., 1935. German Nazis created large public performances to earn public support. [[File:Depression, Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, New York City, in the absence of substantial government... - NARA - 196506.tif|thumb|[[Great Depression]], Breadlines-long line of people waiting to be fed, [[New York City]], [[United States]] i|alt=|150x150px]]Worldwide prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] served to punctuate the end of the previous era, as ''The Great Depression'' set in. The ''Great Depression'' was a worldwide economic [[Recession|downturn]] starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries.&lt;ref name="CRomer1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression "Great Depression"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest and most important [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''New York Times'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. [[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title=Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cochrane, Willard W.|title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of economic activity|primary sector industries]] suffered the most.

Parket Willis Lecture in Economic Policy", March 2, 2004, FDR Library Web Site.''&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist [[Demagogy|demagogues]]—the most infamous being [[Adolf Hitler]]—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of [[Nazism]]. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.

===== The League and crises =====
[[File:Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg|thumb|U.K Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] attempted to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]] as Nazi Germany practiced an expansionist policy .|alt=|left]]
The interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.[[File:Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, Hebei, autumn 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] soldiers defending at the Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, [[Hebei]], [[China]] autumn 1937. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] cost at least twenty millions lives. ]]A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan and the [[Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], one of the only free African nations at that time.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, Münchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|left|thumb|The signatories [[Munich Agreement]] where British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] [[Appeasement|appeased]] to the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] regarding territorial claims in [[Sudetenland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid conflict.]]
The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.

===== Tripartite Pact =====
[[File:Shashin Shuho No 151.jpg|left|thumb|141x141px|Japanese poster advocating for Tripartite Pact, 1941.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940–41, and with the continuing war in China, the United States placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[South East Asia]]—specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

=====World War II=====

{{Main|World War II}}

It is important to note that the [[Empire of Japan]] was not at war with the [[Soviet Union]] despite being part of the [[Tripartite Pact]].]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-012-0037-23A, Polen, Straßenkampf, Infanterie.jpg|left|thumb|The German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 is the official start of [[World War II|WWII]]]]

The Second World War was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in [[the Holocaust]] and ending with the dropping of the [[atom bomb]].

Even though Japan had been invading in China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1, 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland, the [[Drang nach Osten]]. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.
The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.
[[File:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red Army.jpg|alt=Holocaust Survivors, January 1945|thumb|Survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] at the infamous German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] located in Occupied Poland. ]]
Following the lull in fighting, known as the "[[Phoney War]]", Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the [[Tripartite Pact]], and were known as the [[Axis Powers]].Nine months later, on June 22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany – Germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against the Axis.

On December 7, 1941, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor]], bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful" during the [[World War II]]&lt;ref name = Justus&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doenecke |first1=Justus D. |last2=Stoler |first2=Mark A. |title=Debating Franklin D.

It is possible that around 62 million people [[World War II casualties|died in the war]]; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, [[genocide]] (in particular, the [[Holocaust]]), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.
The Holocaust (which roughly means "burnt whole") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other "unwanted" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.

After World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Western Europe]] later aligned as the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and [[Eastern Europe]] as the [[Warsaw Pact]]. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the [[British Empire]] to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the [[Cold War]]. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its [[democratization]]. [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.

The mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history.

Over the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita [[gross domestic product]] grew by a factor of five,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bradford DeLong, [http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html ''Cornucopia: Increasing Wealth in the Twentieth Century''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230090216/http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/2000/TCEH_2.html |date=2005-12-30 }}. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning.  However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider,&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Wayne. ''Theoretical criminology: from modernity to post-modernism''. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Program). ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being''. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2005. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the [[Global South]]. Large-scale industry and more centralized [[Mass media|media]] made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented. However, the increased communications contributed to [[democratization]]. Technological developments included the development of airplanes and [[space exploration]], [[nuclear technology]], advancement in [[genetics]], and the dawning of the [[Information Age]].

=== American Peace ===

{{Main|Pax Americana}}
Pax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.
{{details|American Century}}

=== Cold War era ===
{{Main|Cold War}}
The Cold War began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict included costly defense spending, a massive [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and numerous [[proxy war]]s; the two [[superpower]]s never fought one another directly.

[[File:NATO vs. Warsaw (1949-1990).svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|{{center|Borders of [[NATO]] (blue) and [[Warsaw Pact]] (red) states during the Cold war era.}}]]
The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a policy of "[[containment]]" of [[communism]] and forged myriad alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe, including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the world, such as Latin America and [[Southeast Asia]], the Soviet Union fostered [[communist revolution]]ary movements, which the United States and many of its allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to "[[rollback|roll back]]". Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge.

In China [[Mao Zedong]] (''Máo zé dōng'') utilized [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought. When the [[Communist Party of China]] assumed power in 1959, previous schools of Chinese thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward. Many parts of China's past were even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though initially friendly with the [[Soviet Union]] the Chinese and Soviet communists diverged in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1960. Through the end of the Cold-War, China would continue on its own path from other communist countries, building better relations with the United States after 1972. China's economy would recover from the Cultural Revolution due to [[Chinese economic reform|market-oriented reforms]] led by [[Deng Xiaoping]].

The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) and [[Able Archer 83|NATO exercises in November 1983]]. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought [[détente]]. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for [[mutual assured destruction]] using deliverable [[nuclear weapon]]s.

The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' reforms. [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|The Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power, though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet nuclear arsenal.

=== Latin America polarization ===

In Latin America in the 1970s, leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America. In the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |author=Victor Flores Olea |title=Editoriales – El Universal – 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor |work=[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico |accessdate=2009-03-24 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021303/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html |archivedate=June 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies.

=== Space Age ===

[[File:Neil Armstrong small step.wav|left|thumb|Neil Armstrong small step]]
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a photograph of Earth as seen from Apollo 17. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase of interest in both [[space exploration]] and the [[environmental movement]].]]
The [[Space Age]] is a period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83&amp;nbsp;kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the [[Vostok programme]] and reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]] which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11]] was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], public attention has largely moved to other areas.

== Education and schools ==
The [[humanities]] are academic disciplines which study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic induction|analytic]], critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. Although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world.

=== British education ===
Students can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history; very few teach the subject exclusively.

=== Universities ===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[List of alumni of Jesus College, Oxford]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Oxford]] 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period that can be studied in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History begins in 285.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''''Our World''''' was the first live, international, [[satellite television]] production, which was broadcast on 25 June 1967. Creative artists, including [[the Beatles]], opera singer [[Maria Callas]], and painter [[Pablo Picasso]] – representing nineteen nations – were invited to perform or appear in separate segments featuring their respective countries. The two-and-a-half-hour event had the largest television audience ever up to that date: an estimated 400 to 700 million people around the globe watched the broadcast. Today, it is most famous for the segment from the United Kingdom starring the Beatles. They performed their song "[[All You Need Is Love]]" for the first time to close the broadcast.

== Planning ==
[[File:INTELSAT I (Early Bird).jpg|thumb|The [[Intelsat I]] nicknamed "Early Bird", one of the satellites used]]
The project was conceived by [[BBC]] producer [[Aubrey Singer]]. It was transferred to the [[European Broadcasting Union]], but the [[master control]] room for the broadcast was still at the BBC in London. The satellites used were [[Intelsat I]] (known as "Early Bird"), Intelsat 2-2 ("Lani Bird"), Intelsat 2–3 ("Canary Bird"), and [[NASA]]'s [[ATS-1]].&lt;ref name="AirSpaceMag 1996"&gt;

It took ten months to bring everything together. One hitch was the sudden pull-out of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries headed by the [[Soviet Union]] in the week leading up to the broadcast. Apparently it was a protest at the Western nations' response to the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;

The ground rules included that no politicians or heads of state could participate in the broadcast. In addition, everything had to be "live", so no use of videotape or film was permitted. Ten thousand technicians, producers and interpreters took part in the broadcast. Each country had its own announcers, due to language issues, and interpreters voiced over the original sound when not in a country's native language. Fourteen countries participated in the production, which was transmitted to 24 countries, with an estimated audience of between 400 and 700 million people.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Broadcast ==
The opening credits were accompanied by the Our World theme sung in 22 different languages by the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]].&lt;ref name="EBU"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flowers |first=Brian |title=The Technical History of Eurovision |work=EBU Technical Review |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=4 July 2007 |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/techreview/trev_311-flowers_eurovision.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLfdxHb?url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_311-flowers_eurovision.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[CBC Television]] had [[Marshall McLuhan]] being interviewed in a Toronto [[Television studio#Production-control room|television control room]].  At 7:17 pm GMT, the show switched to the United States' segment about the [[Glassboro, New Jersey]] conference between American president [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]; since ''Our World'' insisted that no politicians be shown, only the house where the conference was being held was televised. [[National Educational Television]]'s (NET) Dick McCutcheon ended up talking about the impact of the new television technology on a global scale.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

The show switched back to Canada at 7:18 pm GMT.  Segments that were beamed worldwide were from a Ghost Lake, [[Alberta]] [[ranch]], showing a rancher, and his [[Cutting (sport)|cutting horse]], cutting out a herd of [[cattle]]. The last Canadian segment was from [[Kitsilano Beach]], located in [[Vancouver]]'s [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]] district at 7:19 pm GMT.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

At 7:20 pm GMT, the program shifted continents to Asia, with Tokyo, Japan being the next segment. It was 4:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time and [[NHK]] showed the construction of the [[Tokyo subway]] system.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

The equator was crossed for the first time in the program  when it switched to the Australian contributions, which was at 5:22&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Time in Australia|Australian Eastern Standard Time]] (AEST). This was the most technically complicated point in the broadcast, as both the Japanese and Australian satellite ground stations had to reverse their actions: Tokyo had to go from transmit mode to receive mode, while [[Melbourne]] had to switch from receive to transmit mode.&lt;ref name="AirSpaceMag 1996" /&gt; The first segment dealt with [[W-class Melbourne tram|trams]] leaving the [[South Melbourne tram depot]] with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]'s Brian King explaining that sunrise was many hours away as it was winter there.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; Two scientific segments, later on in the broadcast, were also included; one, presented from Canberra by the ABC's Eric Hunter showed experiments being carried out by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) to extend the frequency of cereal crop cycles, while the second dealt with the [[Parkes Observatory]] tracking a deep space object.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rowsthorn |first=Peter |title=Moment in Time Episode 12: First Satellite Broadcast |work=[[Can We Help?]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://abc.net.au/tv/canwehelp/txt/s1914605.htm |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLu7Bh9?url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/canwehelp/txt/s1914605.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |location=Sydney |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Beatles' sequence ==
[[File:All you need is love.jpg|thumb|right|The Beatles performing "All You Need is Love"]]
The broadcast took place at the height of the [[Vietnam War]]. The Beatles were asked to write a song with a positive message.&lt;ref name="Twenty Years"&gt;{{cite document |last=Sheppard |first=John |publisher=[[ITV Granada|Granada TV]]|title=It was 20 Years Ago Today |date=3 June 1987 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093285/ |accessdate=4 June 2007}} Granada TV documentary shows the Beatles' ''Our World'' broadcast segment.&lt;/ref&gt; At 8:54 GMT the Beatles topped the event with their debut performance of "[[All You Need Is Love]]". The Beatles invited many of their friends to the event to create a festive atmosphere and to join in on the song's chorus. Among the friends were members of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Keith Moon]] and [[Graham Nash]].&lt;ref name="Twenty Years" /&gt; 

Although the program was originally recorded and transmitted in [[black-and-white]], for its use in the 1995 TV special ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', the [[All You Need Is Love#Live broadcast|Beatles' performance]] on the 1967 program was [[Film colorization|colourised]], using colour photographs taken at the event as a reference.&lt;ref name="Beatles color"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/anthvid.html |title=Anthology Home Video |accessdate=27 June 2010 |author=Sella, Tom |year=1996 |publisher=Beatles Reference Library |quote=Laserdisc 7, Side 1, Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence opens in its original monochromatic format and rapidly morphs into full colour, conveying the brightly coloured [[flower power]] and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]-style clothing worn by the Beatles and their guests that was popular during what was subsequently dubbed the "[[Summer of Love]]".&lt;ref name="Beatles color" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the novel ''[[The Light of Other Days]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], the global media empire run by Hiram Patterson is called OurWorld, the name chosen after the character saw the program as a child and was inspired to change the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Arthur C. |last2=Baxter |first2=Stephen |date= 2001-01-15|title=The Light of Other Days |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejQ6Oc-VKJQC |page=15 |publisher=Tor Books |isbn=0-312-87199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It shows a proposed political division of the world after World War II in the event of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in which the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union as well as the Republic of China would rule. The map includes a [[manifesto]] describing a "New World Moral Order", along with quotes from Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] speech.

Gomberg created the map as a personal project, and little else is known of him. The map has been highlighted by [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracy theorists]] who believe it represents some broader view of the US government, and has also been widely circulated online.&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/PoliticalForum/web/new-world-order&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709164944/http://digg.com/world_news/Post_War_New_World_Order_Map?t=15783998 "Outline of post-war new world map" by Maurice Gomberg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/13846978/1942-POSTWAR-NEW-WORLD-MAP-by-Maurice-Gomberg]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523072941/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13846978/1942-POSTWAR-NEW-WORLD-MAP-by-Maurice-Gomberg |date=May 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13371">'''Pacification theory''' is a counter-hegemonic approach to the study of [[police]] and [[security]] which views the contemporary security-industrial complex as both an organizing and systematic war strategy targeting [[Sovereign state|domestic]] and [[foreign policy|foreign]] enemies while simultaneously acting as a process that actively fabricates a [[social order]] conducive to [[capitalist accumulation]]. According to its academic proponents, such an approach to police and security reveals inherent [[Class conflict|class war]] dimensions that have been reinforced by police intellectuals since at least the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ozcan, Gulden and George S. Rigakos. 2014. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog621/full "Pacification"] The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt;

At base, pacification reflects the need to fabricate productive territories and subjects conducive to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;George S. Rigakos, John L. McMullan, Joshua Johnson &amp; Gülden Ozcan, Eds. 2009. [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/general-police-system-political-economy-security-age-enlightenment/ A General Police System: Political Economy and Security in the Age of Enlightenment].

Socialist Studies / Études socialistes 9 (2) Winter 2013:2&lt;/ref&gt; explain: "The extraction of surplus, as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. 1981. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm Wealth of Nations]. Indianapolis: Liberty Fund.,p.387&lt;/ref&gt; admits, can ‘be squeezed out of [the labourer] by [[violence]] only, and not by any interest of his own’ if he can [[subsist]] otherwise such as through access to [[communal land]]. This, in short, is the foundational [[bourgeois]] logic for the compulsion to pacify."

==Central tenets==
Pacification theory may vary in its use depending on the analyst, but most scholars associated with Anti-security&lt;ref&gt;Manolov, Martin V. and George S. Rigakos. 2014. "[https://www.academia.edu/8020906/Anti-security Anti-security]". The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt; would likely agree that its central tenets encompass:&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"&gt;Rigakos, George. ""To Extend the Scope of Productive Labour:" Pacification as a Police Project." [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-Security]. Eds. Rigakos, George and Mark Neocleous. Ottawa: Red Quill Books, 2011. 57-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# problematizing the objectives of [[security]];  
# building analytic connections instead of masking them;  
# displacing the ubiquity and reach of security; and   
# anticipating a state of war (including [[Class conflict|class war]]) viewing security as an active, unfinished project rife with resistance.
Associated with this last point and serving an essential component of pacification is its immediate connection to making subjects economically "[[Productive and unproductive labour|productive]]" both historically within the plans of [[military]] and [[colonialism|colonial]] overseers and by contemporary police actions, both domestic and international. Neocleous has characterized this process as making war through peace:&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2010. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593571/War_as_Peace_Peace_as_Pacification War as Peace, Peace as Pacification].” Radical Philosophy 159, pp. 8-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 | quote  = " we need to grasp security ''as'' pacification... whereas for most people ‘pacification’ is associated with the actions of colonizing powers, has a close connection to counter-insurgency tactics and is therefore widely understood as the military crushing of resistance, an examination of the theory and practice of pacification reveals a far more ‘productive’ dimension to the idea. ‘Productive’ in that what is involved is less the military crushing of resistance and more the fabrication of order, of which the crushing of resistance is but one part."

A final element of pacification invoked by scholars in this field of study is its connection to the apparent primacy of security thinking and planning in a [[capitalist economy]].  This pronouncement is often linked to [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that "security is the supreme concept of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society" in the [[Jewish Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. 1844. On the Jewish Question. https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/&lt;/ref&gt;  A connection believed to be so embedded that Rigakos has argued that "security ''is'' hegemony".&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="academia9"&gt;Manolov, Martin V. (2012). “[https://www.academia.edu/3592253/Anti-Security_Q_and_A_Interview_of_George_S._Rigakos Anti-Security: Q &amp; A, Interview of George S. Rigakos],” The Annual Review of Interdisciplinary Justice Research, vol. 3, pp. 9-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The development of '''pacification theory''' is a re-appropriation of the historical usage of the term.  It is offered as an alternative to [[security]] as part of a broader analytic [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-security] project.&lt;ref name="academia9"/&gt; The development of pacification theory to re-cast security is believed to help radical scholars grasp the inherent objectives and operation of [[security]] politics since [[the Enlightenment]], and is intended to give [[activists]] a ground to stand against the [[securitization]] of political discourse that increasingly surrounds the policing of [[dissent]] in the [[post-9/11]] period.

During the social uprisings in the 1960s in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] against the [[Vietnam War]], pacification came to connote [[bombing]] people into submission and waging an [[ideological]] war against the opposition. However, after the Vietnam War, pacification was dropped from the official [[discourse]] as well as from the discourse of opposition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2008. [http://www.mqup.ca/critique-of-security-products-9780773534810.php Critique of Security]. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although approach towards the term and practices of pacification both in the concept’s sixteenth-century and twentieth-century [[Colonialism and Colonies|colonial]] meanings were somehow related to the concepts of [[war]], [[security]] and police power, the real connection between pacification and these concepts has never been revealed in the literature on [[international relations]], [[conflict studies]], [[criminology]] or [[political science]]. Neocleous&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2007. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593467/Security_Liberty_and_the_Myth_of_Balance Security, Liberty and the Myth of Balance: Towards a Critique of Security Politics.]” Contemporary Political Theory 6, pp. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the connection between pacification and the ideological discourse on security is related to the terms use in broader [[Western philosophy|Western]] social and [[political thought]] in general, and [[liberal theory]] in particular. In short, that [[liberalism]]’s key concept is less [[liberty]] and more security and that liberal [[doctrine]] is inherently less committed to [[peace]] and far more to legitimizing [[violence]].

In [https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration], Neocleous and Rigakos&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark and George S. Rigakos. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration]”, pp. 15-21 in Anti-security. Ottawa: Red Quill Books., p.16&lt;/ref&gt; provocatively summed this argument in the following way: "In the works of the founders of the [[Liberal democracy|liberal]] tradition - that is, the founders of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ideology - liberty is security and security is liberty. For the [[ruling class]], security always has and always will triumph over liberty because ‘liberty’ has never been intended as a counter-weight to security. Liberty has always been security’s [[lawyer]]."

From the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century onwards, the growth of towns in [[Europe]] generated a concern over “masterlesse men,” as [[Thomas Hobbes]] puts it, and their forms of behaviour exposed in [[urban area|urban]] life such as [[gambling]], [[drinking]], [[adultery]], [[blasphemy]] and wandering.&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593846/A_Brighter_and_Nice_New_Life_Security_as_Pacification ‘A Brighter and Nicer New Life’: Security as Pacification.]” Social and Legal Studies 20(2), pp. 191-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacification, then, functions as a thread that connects sixteenth-century European [[colonialism]] and the fabrication of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[social order]] in eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the US project in Vietnam and contemporary military exercises of [[Empire]] both throughout the globe and domestically.

==General theory==
In [http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9781474413664.html Security/Capital],&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, George S. 2016. ''Security/Capital: A General Theory of Pacification'' University of Edinburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rigakos offers a General Theory of Pacification.  He argues that pacification is composed of three overlapping strata: (1) Dispossession; (2) [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]] and (3) [[Commodification]].  Commodification is itself composed of three processes: (a) [[valorization]]; (b) prudentialization; and (c) [[fetishization]]. According to Rigakos, while different in their strategic targets of intervention, each of these three strata of pacification in their aggregate nonetheless both produce and rely on:
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "(1) the use and/ or threat of use of [[violence]]; (2) the legal, institutional, and police subversion and suppression of non-capitalist forms of subsistence and exchange; (3) the circulation of a “[[moral education]]” aimed at ideologically reinforcing capitalist exchange, the wage-labor system, and bourgeois practices and norms among workers, and, finally (4) establishing an institutional and ideological ethic of security that equates threats to any of these aspects as threats to the state of security and the private property relations it supports."
 | source = From: George Rigakos. 2016. [http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9781474413664.html Security/Capital: A General Theory of Pacification]. Edinburgh University Press, p.27
 | width = 100%
 | align = left
}}
The aggregate effect of this theory is the conclusion that the global economic system is now conditioned by pacification as it never has been before.  Rigakos suggests that "the security–
industrial complex is, materially and ideologically, the blast furnace of global capitalism, fuelling both the conditions for the system’s perpetuation while feeding relentlessly on the surpluses it has exacted."&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, Security/Capital, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Per Fugelli''' (7 December 1943 – 13 September 2017) was a Norwegian physician and professor of [[General Practice]] at the [[University of Bergen]] from 1984 to 1992, and [[social medicine]] at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1992 until his death in 2017.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Per Fugelli |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Per_Fugelli|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Fugelli was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, on December 7, 1943. He studied medicine at [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Barbara Casassus. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32737-X Obituary Per Fugelli.] The Lancet, Volume 390, No. 10107, p2032, 4 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1971–73 Fugelli was a general practitioner in [[Værøy]] and [[Røst]], and from 1977 to 1980 in [[Porsanger]]. During this time he earned his PhD and graduated in 1978.

He became a Professor of [[social medicine]] at University of Oslo´s Institute of Health and Society. In 2013, he became Emeritus.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1993 Fugelli wrote: "The patient Earth is sick. Global environmental disruptions can have serious consequences for human health. It's time for doctors to give a world diagnosis and advise on treatment," &lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; predating the founding of [[planetary health]]. He is the subject of the documentary ''I die'' by filmmaker [[Erik Poppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nfi.no/eng/film?name=per-fugelli--i-die&amp;id=1859|title=Per Fugelli - I die|last=|first=|date=|work=Norwegian Film Institute|access-date=2018-08-29|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations.

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Radio International}}) is [[Sweden]]'s official [[international broadcasting]] station. It is a non-commercial and politically independent public service broadcasting company.

==History==
SR International is part of [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), Sweden's non-commercial public-radio broadcasting organization. The service was founded in 1938, at the approach of [[World War II]], as a way of keeping Swedes living abroad informed of happenings in Sweden and of Swedish opinion. Programming was at first in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] only, but in 1939 [[English language|English-]] and [[German-language]] broadcasts were added.

After the war, further language services were added: in [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. At the close of the [[Cold War]], the services in French, Portuguese, and Spanish were gradually phased out and replaced by new services in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The latter services were withdrawn once [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] had developed their own independent media and joined the [[European Union]].

Radio Sweden also operated a service in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] between 2004 and 2009.

In the 1990s Radio Sweden was merged with SR's Immigrant Languages Department to form the SR International channel. For a while, immigrant language services, such as those in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], were additionally carried on [[shortwave]].

==Programming in other languages==
The Radio Sweden English Service seeks to provide a window on the diverse perspectives and issues in [[Sweden]] today.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Its programs and website offer a ”[[Smörgåsbord#Other use of the term in English|smörgåsbord]]” of news and current affairs, science and technology, lifestyle, and culture.

In the beginning of 2016, the international service underwent a major reorganization. English language news about Sweden for overseas listeners were moved to a 30 minutes-a-week show on P2 and to social media. Minority languages service was further focused on those minorities living in Sweden and integrated with Swedish language services. 

Service in languages of the oppressed nations, such as Somali, were moved to an independent organization. News for overseas listeners in foreign languages other than English, such as Russian and German, has been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6249380&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been several foreign-leagugaes services in the history of Radio Sweden. The German Programm got disfunct after 76 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=6379933 German Service of SR&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former programs==

===''Sweden Calling DXers''===
One of the most popular programs on Radio Sweden was ''[[Sweden Calling DXers]]'', founded in 1948 by [[Arne skoog|Arne Skoog]]. He reasoned that [[shortwave listening]] or [[DXing]] was a very young hobby, and that by providing information in a weekly program for shortwave listeners about their hobby, Radio Sweden was teaching its own audience about how to listen better. While the first program was based solely on Arne's own listening, listeners were encouraged to write in with their own news, and soon virtually all of the program was based on listener's letters (an early example of interactvity).

The program was carried on Tuesdays in all of Radio Sweden's services except Swedish.

When Arne Skoog retired in connection with the program's 30th anniversary in 1978, the program was taken over by [[George Wood (Radio Sweden)|George Wood]], a member of the Radio Sweden English Service. After a number of years, as media changed, it began to cover less about shortwave, and more about satellite radio and television. Later coverage was extended to the Internet, the focus was shifted to concentrating on Swedish media, and the name of the English version of the program was changed to "MediaScan". "MediaScan" was the first English-language radio program in Europe (and the second overall in Europe) to post audio on the Internet (on the ftp sites [[funet|ftp.funet.fi]] and [[SUNET|ftp.sunet.se]], as well as via Internet Multicasting).

In 2001 the program was discontinued, but remains in a somewhat sporadic form on the Radio Sweden website.

===''The Saturday Show''===
Another popular Radio Sweden program was ''[[The Saturday Show (Radio Sweden)|The Saturday Show]]'', with [[Roger Wallis]] and Kim Loughran, which ran from 1967 to 1981. The program was launched to showcase Swedish rock and pop music in a world dominated by American and British rock. Using Radio Sweden's relatively high-powered medium wave transmitter on 1179&amp;nbsp;kHz, the entire program was 90 minutes in length, and featured many satirical sketches, often political and sometimes controversial. A 30-minute segment of the entire broadcast was the Radio Sweden shortwave program on Saturdays.

==End of radio broadcasting==
On October 20, 2010, Radio Sweden ceased broadcasts on shortwave and medium wave, as Swedish Radio's management decided that the Internet had matured enough to support international broadcasts. At the same time the English Service was extended to national broadcasts on FM, but programming on weekends was discontinued. Services in English also continue on satellite, both using Swedish Television's satellite and the [[World Radio Network]].

'''Shortwave relay stations''' are transmitter sites used by international broadcasters to extend their coverage to areas that cannot be reached easily from their home state. E.g., the BBC operates an extensive net of relay stations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WUO4U8L5N_cC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=BBC+Cyprus+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xZ2_zgGDoe&amp;sig=CvCV-2Gyiyhp3edNcWdIhBPelIc&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=4xkZSoOZO9LL_AaUwODrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA168,M1 BBC Cyprus relay.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

These days the programs are fed to the relay sites by satellite, cable/optical fiber or the Internet. Frequencies, transmitter power and antennas depend on the desired coverage. Some regional relays even operate in the medium wave or FM bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_listen.shtml How to listen to the BBC.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relay stations are also important to reach listeners in countries that practice [[radio jamming]]. Depending on the effect of the [[shortwave]] dead zone the target countries can jam the programs only locally, e.g. for bigger cities. For this purpose [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] with studios in [[Munich]], Germany operated a relay station in Portugal, in the extreme west of Europe, to reach then-communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ8QN69KZQQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA113&amp;lpg=RA1-PA113&amp;dq=Radio+Free+europe+portugal+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SRxNpMwTc5&amp;sig=Lw1vvEYB7vrJ0fUJ_03252D7jX8&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=_x4ZSujpBYLK_gab443ZDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Radio Free Europe.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations in design ==
Two and only one broadcasting technology couples all of the components of a traditional shortwave relay station into one unit: the [[ALLISS]] module. For persons totally unfamiliar with the concepts of how shortwave relay stations operate this design may be the most understandable.

The ALLISS module is a fully rotatable [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] system for high power (typically 500&amp;nbsp;kW only) [[shortwave radio]] [[broadcasting]]—it essentially is a '''self contained shortwave relay station'''.

Most of the world's shortwave relay stations do not use this technology, due to its cost (15m EUR per ALLISS module: Transmitter + Antenna + Automation equipment).

== Planning and design ==
A traditional shortwave relay station—depending on how many transmitters and antennas that it will have—may take up to two years to plan.  After planning is completed, it may take up to five years to construct the relay station.

The historically long design and planning cycle for shortwave relay stations ended in the 1990s. Many advanced software planning tools (not related to the relay station design proper) became available. Choosing a series of  sites for a relay station is about 100 times faster using [[Google Earth]], for example. With the modern graphical version of Ioncap, simplified propagation studies can completed in less than a week for any chosen site.

In some cases, existing relay stations can have their designs more or less duplicated, thus  speeding up development time. However, there is one general exception to this: the [[ALLISS]] Module. From initial planning to deployment of ALLISS Modules may take a mere 1.5 years to 9 months depending on the number of modules deployed at one time in a particular sector of a country.

=== Graphic examples ===
{{clear}}

=== How relay stations operate ===
These are considered general operating parameters:
* 20 hours per day, but geopolitical reasons may dictate some stations run 24 hours per day (a 168-hour week)
* Generally 360 days per year, depending on the number of redundant transmitters and antennas
* Relay Stations generally consume from 250 kilowatts (kW) to 10 megawatts (MW)
* A single 100&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 225&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* A single 300&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 625&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* Modulator efficiency: Class-B modulators have about a 65% efficiency level, but digital (PDM or PSM or hybrid variants) modulators have about an 85% efficiency level as a general rule (for Amplitude Modulation)
* Broadcast times and frequencies are under [[ITU]] regulation

=== How relay stations are designed ===
General requirements of shortwave relay stations:
* Road access (fairly universal)
* HVAC mains access building or transformer in the transmitter building itself
* Staff quarters (if the relay station is not fully automated)
* Incoming audio processing centre, but since the mid-1980s this has evolved into one to five rack units
* Transmitter hall (50&amp;nbsp;kW, 100&amp;nbsp;kW, 250&amp;nbsp;kW, 300&amp;nbsp;kW, 500&amp;nbsp;kW [[shortwave]] transmitter)
* Switch matrix (but these are not typically used by [[ALLISS]] modules)
* [[Balun]]s (but their use is not always required nor universal)
* [[antenna tuner]]s (sometimes called ATUs or [[roller coasters]] because of their appearance)
* Feeder lines (coax cable and open feeder lines are the most common feeders in use)
* HRS-type antennas, or occasionally [[log-periodic]] (horizontal)
* In parts of the developing world [[log-periodic]] (horizontal) antennas are used to provide less directional gain to a target area.

=== Where the broadcast programs go ===
* generally to target areas that are more than 300&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site
* most shortwave relay station target areas are 1500&amp;nbsp;km to 3500&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site

=== Mobile relay stations ===
The IEEE Book series "The History of International Broadcasting" (Volume I) describes mobile shortwave relay stations used by the German propaganda ministry during WWII, to avoid them being located by [[radio direction finding]] and bombed by the Allies.    They consisted of a generator truck, transmitter truck and an antenna truck, and are thought to have had a radiated power of about 50&amp;nbsp;kW.  Radio Industry Zagreb (RIZ Transmitters) currently produces mobile shortwave transmitters.

== Notable sites : Issoudun ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The International broadcasting center of TDF (Télédiffusion de France) is at [[Issoudun]]/[[Saint-Aoustrille]].  As of 2011, Issoudun is utilized by [[TDF Group|TDF]] for [[shortwave]] transmissions. The site uses 12 rotary [[ALLISS]] antennas fed by 12 transmitters of 500&amp;nbsp;kW each to transmit shortwave broadcasts by [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI), along with other broadcast services.

:''See [[Influenza pandemic]] for government preparation for an H5N1 pandemic''
The '''social impact of H5N1''' is the effect or influence of [[H5N1]] in human society; especially the financial, political, social, and personal responses to both actual and predicted deaths in birds, humans, and other animals. Billions of dollars are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] pandemic. Over ten billion dollars have been lost and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall. Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On January 18, 2006 donor nations pledged two billion US dollars to combat bird flu at the two-day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Newswire]&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten billion dollars have been spent and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12033509/ MSNBC] [http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf US AID] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815071811/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf |date=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', due to the H5N1 threat, as of March 2006: "governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin NYT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment strategies are being altered to manage the effects of H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html BMO Financial Group]&lt;/ref&gt; This changes the valuations of trillions of dollars' worth of stocks worldwide as investors move assets in accordance with both fears and hopes.

Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1:
*killing millions of poultry
*[[Vaccination|vaccinating]] poultry against bird flu
*vaccinating poultry workers against [[human flu]]
*limiting travel in areas where H5N1 is found
*increasing farm hygiene
*reducing contact between [[livestock]] and wild birds
*reducing open-air [[wet market]]s
*limiting workers contact with [[Cockfight|cock fighting]]
*reducing purchases of live fowl
*improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php Council on Foreign Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053617/http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after nearly two years of using mainly culling to control the virus, the [[Vietnam]] government in 2005 adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} article ''Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu'' published on April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply, resulting in devastating losses for many poultry farmers. Poor poultry farmers can't afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether. Multinational poultry farming is increasingly becoming a profit loser as H5N1 achieves status as endemic in wild birds worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial ruin for poor poultry farmers, that can be as severe as threatening starvation, has caused some to commit suicide and many others to stop cooperating with efforts to deal with H5N1; further increasing the human toll, the spread of the disease and the chances for a pandemic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/BKK260524.htm Reuters] article ''Cambodian ostracised for reporting bird flu'' published on April 12, 2006.

==Political==
[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US HHS]] Secretary [[Michael O. Leavitt]] has said "Everything you say in advance of a [[pandemic]] is [[alarmist]]; anything you do after it starts is inadequate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title=Virginia Pandemic Influenza Summit informs community partners about pandemic influenza plans at the national and state level |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

H5N1, like everything else, is subject to [[spin (public relations)|political spin]]; wherein every interest group picks and chooses among the facts to support their favorite cause resulting in a distortion of the overall picture, the motivations of the people involved and the believability of the predictions.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]], formerly [[United States Secretary of Defense]], is a past board member and current minor shareholder of [[Gilead Sciences]] which owns [[intellectual property rights]] to [[Oseltamivir]] (also called "Tamiflu"). In November 2005, George W. Bush urged Congress to pass 7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which one billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.

Some believe ''The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is essentially a problem of industrial poultry practices.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194 Grain international, non-profit foundation] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4721598.stm BBC news] [http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= CNN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201320/http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= |date=2006-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have a more nuanced position. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] article ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.:"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm CDC] ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert Webster explains: "If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10639567/ MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying that "The issue of vaccines has to take top priority", and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying that China's vaccinations could be "masking" the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |title=China H5N1 outbreak puts vaccines under spotlight |date=17 March 2006 |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318225839/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |archive-date=18 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: "The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4737276.stm BBC] ''Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet'' February 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have called for tax breaks due to H5N1. A May 7, 2006 report from India E-News states that: "Pakistani poultry farmers have sought a 10-year tax exemption to support their dwindling business after the detection of the H5N1 strain of bird flu triggered a fall in demand and prices, a poultry trader said. "We have asked the government to give us tax exemption on income from the poultry business for at least 10 years to meet losses caused by the bird flu scare", Abdul Basit told DPA. Basit, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) in the country's commercial hub of Lahore, was part of a delegation of the Pakistan Poultry Association, which met food ministry officials to present their demand. The federal poultry board of the food ministry is to meet on May 9 to consider the tax-cut demand for the poultry business in the upcoming national budget due in mid-June."&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiaenews.com/2006-05/6960-pakistani-poultry-demands-10-year-tax-holiday.htm India eNews] article ''Pakistani poultry industry demands 10-year tax holiday'' published May 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reuters]] reported that [[WHO]] expert Hassan al-Bushra said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even now, we remain unsure about [[Tamiflu]]'s real effectiveness. As for a vaccine, work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic. However, it is crucial that countries in the Middle East invest and start developing their own research and technical facilities, where they can produce their own drugs when the time comes rather than wait to import expensive medicines from abroad at the risk of their population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/e83d17668fc60eb55518a76c1de858fd.htm Reuters article ''MIDDLE EAST: Interview with WHO experts Hassan al-Bushra and John Jabbour''] 2 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a pandemic occurs, local response will be more important than national or international response, as every community will have its own resources swamped dealing with its own problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title="Any community that fails to prepare with the expectation the federal government will come to the rescue will be tragically wrong." - US HHS |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International groups, nations, local governments, corporations, schools, and groups of all kinds have made plans and run drills to prepare for an H5N1 pandemic.

Online avian flu forums have received increasing attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avianflutalk.com/ Avian flu forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-help groups have organized to provide news and information about resources, aid and relief efforts in preparation for avian flu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avianfluhelp.blogspot.com/ Avian flu help]&lt;/ref&gt;

British reports warn that in response to an [[influenza pandemic]] local groups will not be able to rely on the armed forces, widespread infection could occur in days not months, an effective vaccine can not be counted on, and the huge death toll could swamp mortuaries so "A key point for local planning is likely to be the identification of potential sites for the location of facilities for the temporary storage of bodies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=508792006 Scotsman News] Report on leaked British study.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Many individuals have stockpiled supplies (Tamiflu, food, water, etc.) for a possible flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Many+individuals+have+stockpiled+supplies+%28Tamiflu%2C+food%2C+water%2C+etc%29+for+a+possible+flu+pandemic.&amp;btnG=Google+Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals have started web sites and companies using interest and ignorance in H5N1 to sell information, cures, and advertising space. Some even use concern over H5N1 to find victims for their [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/27/spyware_diy/ The Register] article "S'kiddies get into spyware for just $15" by John Leyden published March 27, 2006 accessed February 28, 2007 says "Spam samples trapped by internet security firm Sophos use newsworthy topics to lure unwary users. One presents itself as a warning about the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, providing links to the bogus website, purporting to offer health advice. [...] Surfers visiting these websites will find themselves exposed to JavaScript code that attempts to take advantage of known web browser and Windows vulnerabilities to download malware."&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant effect of H5N1 has been personal fear concerning the unknown, even by those most in-the-know. Dr. [[David Nabarro]], chief avian flu coordinator for the United Nations, describes himself as "quite scared"; says avian flu has too many unanswered questions; and if the disease starts spreading to humans, borders will close, airports will shut down, and travelers everywhere will be stranded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/27/news/worrier.php NYT article picked up by IHT]&lt;/ref&gt; With evaluations of the threat ranging from those who say it is a hoax to those who warn of billions of humans dying, uncertainty and fear motivate personal behaviors around the world affecting many people even before the threat becomes reality.

==Pop culture==

The 1998 chart-topping hit song "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] includes the lines "Chickity China the Chinese chicken / Have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'", a reference to the outbreaks of H5N1 in Hong Kong around the time the song was written.

==Compared to annual flu season==
{{main|Flu season}}
The annual flu season deaths and costs caused by viruses other than H5N1 provide a point of contrast - something to compare against. According to the United States Government, the annual flu in the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the United States. A pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus, could dwarf this impact by overwhelming our health and medical capabilities, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of hospitalizations, and hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Message from President Bush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that: "A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the consequences of a severe pandemic could, in the United States, include 200 million people infected, 90 million clinically ill, and 2 million dead. The study estimates that 30 percent of all workers would become ill and 2.5 percent would die, with 30 percent of workers missing a mean of three weeks of work — resulting in a decrease in the gross domestic product of 5 percent. Furthermore, 18 million to 45 million people would require outpatient care, and economic costs would total approximately $675 billion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/13/1411 New England Journal of Medicine] Volume 354:1411-1413 - March 30, 2006 - Number 13 - ''Vaccines against Avian Influenza — A Race against Time''&lt;/ref&gt; One study concludes that a pandemic that reduced the available dock workers by 28% would cut the throughput capacity for containers arriving at American ports on the West coast by 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Pandemic influenza, worker absenteeism and impacts on freight transportation | From Proc 41st Hawaii Intl Conf Syst Sci, published online Apr 9 {{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119194526/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]

As the American army did not have tanks of its own, the French two-man [[Renault FT]] Light Tank was used by US in the later stages of [[World War I]]. It was cheap and well-suited for mass production, and in addition to its traversable turret another innovative feature of the FT was its engine located at the rear. This pattern, with the gun located in a mounted turret and rear engine, became the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world even to this day.

The '''M1917''' was a US tank accepted by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French [[Renault FT]]. The crew, a driver and gunner, were separated from the engine by a bulkhead. Steel idler wheels replaced the wooden idlers fitted to French examples. Approximately 64 of the M1917 were built before the end of World War I and 10 were sent to Europe, but too late to be used in combat. After the war Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Company, and the C.L. Best Tractor Company created 950 more. 374 had cannons and 526 had machine guns and 50 were signal (radio) tanks. A later modification, the M1917A1, was a lengthened, rebuilt, updated version compared to the French one, having a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Franklin engine and an electric self-starter rather than a crank starter.&lt;ref&gt;The Renault FT Light Tank; S. Zaloga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treat 'Em Rough! Capt. Dale E. Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. troops also used the British Heavy Tanks Mk V and Mk V* (pronounced "Mark Five" and "Mark Five Star"). A battalion trained in England and saw action in France in the last six weeks of the War. On a small number of occasions, U.S. troops were supported by tank units of the French Army operating [[Schneider CA1|Schneider]] and [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] machines.

[[Marmon-Herrington CTLS|Marmon-Herrington tanks]] that could not be delivered because of the fall of the Dutch East Indies were taken over by the US. The CTLS-4TAC and -4TAY tanks were redesignated Light Tank T14 and T16 respectively. They were used for training, some were used in Alaska and by the US Marines. The CTLS-4TAC has the turret offset to the left, the CTLS-4TAY to the right.

===M3/5 Stuart===
====World War II====
[[File:M3-Stuart-Fort-Knox-3.jpg|thumb|right|M3 Stuart at Fort Knox, Kentucky, used for training.]]
The [[M3 Stuart|Stuart]] was an upgrade of the [[M2 Light Tank]].

The initial upgrade was designated the M3 Stuart and had thicker [[vehicle armour|armor]], modified suspension and a 37mm&amp;nbsp;mm gun. Production of the M3 and later the M5 Stuart started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943 with a total of 25,000 produced.

An upgrade of the M3, which was initially called M4 but later redesignated the M5, was developed with improved engines and produced through 1942. The M5 featured a redesigned hull and driver's hatches moved to the top. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and was in turn succeeded by the [[M24 Chaffee|Light Tank M24]] in 1944.

The [[British Army]] was the first to use the M3 in combat. In November 1941, some 170 Stuarts took part in [[Operation Crusader]], with poor results.

Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with better tactics and training of the enemy than superiority of enemy tanks in the [[North African campaign]], the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun, a limited range and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. Crews liked its high speed and mechanical reliability.

From the summer of 1942, when enough US medium tanks had been received, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat. M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British armor units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than US units.

The other major [[Lend-Lease]] recipient of the M3, the [[Soviet Union]], was even less happy with the tank, considering it undergunned, underarmored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The narrow tracks were highly unsuited to operation in winter conditions, as they resulted in high ground pressures that sunk the tank. However, the Stuart was superior to early-war Soviet light tanks such as the [[T-60]], which were often underpowered and possessed even lighter armament than the Stuart. In 1943, the [[Red Army]] tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design wasn't much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.

In [[United States Army|US Army]] service, the M3 first saw combat in the Philippines. Two battalions, comprising the Provisional Tank Group fought in the Bataan peninsula campaign. When the American army joined the [[North African Campaign]] in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength.

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] the US quickly disbanding most of their light tank [[battalion]]s and subordinating the Stuarts to medium tank battalions performing the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening. For the rest of the war, most US tank battalions had three [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[M4 Sherman]]s and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s.

In the European theater, Allied light tanks had to be given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their main cannon armament could not compete with heavier enemy AFVs. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], as [[List of Japanese armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|Japanese tanks]] were both relatively rare and were generally much weaker than even Allied light tanks. [[Imperial Japanese Army#The Second World War|Japanese infantrymen]] were poorly equipped with [[anti-tank]] weapons and tended to attack tanks using close-assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks. In addition, the poor terrain and roads common to the theatre were unsuitable for the much heavier M4 medium tanks, and so initially, only light armor could be deployed. Heavier M4s were eventually brought to overcome heavily entrenched positions, though the Stuart continued to serve in a combat capacity until the end of the war.

The US liquidated its Stuarts when it got sufficient numbers of [[M24 Chaffee]]s but the tank remained in service until the end of the war and well after. In addition to the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by [[France]] and [[China]].

In April 1943 the government started work on the M24 Chaffee, designated '''Light Tank T24''' as a replacement for the [[Stuart tank|M3/M5 Stuart]] after the original replacement, the M7, was rejected in March. Every effort was made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The [[vehicle armour|armor]] was kept light, and a lightweight 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was developed. The design also featured wider tracks and [[torsion bar]] suspension. It had relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. In mid-October the first pilot vehicle was delivered and production began in 1944 under the designation '''Light Tank M24'''. 4,730 were produced by the time production was stopped in August 1945.

The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to F Company, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion and F Company, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion which each received seventeen M24s. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank [[Battalion]] of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]].

The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944 but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M5. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over.

Reports were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, as a vast improvement over the 37&amp;nbsp;mm. The M24 was still not up to the challenge of fighting tanks, however, the bigger gun at least gave it a chance to defend itself. Its light armor made it vulnerable in tank vs. tank actions.

The M24s contribution to winning the war was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the M5s of the armored divisions.

===M4 Sherman===
[[File:Armoured Ramp Carrier.jpg|thumb|right|Sherman tank using a Churchill 'Ark' armored ramp carrier]]

====World War II====
The U.S. Army designed the M4 as a replacement for the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]]. The designated goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank currently in use by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis nations]]. In April 1941 the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the Lee's main gun. This became the Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/index.html AFV database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype M4 was completed in September 1941. The T6 became standardized as the M4, and production after modifications began in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank by Michael J. Canavan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during the production period: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations were manufactured concurrently at different locations.

While most Shermans ran on gasoline, the M4A2 and M4A6 had diesel engines: the M4A2 with a pair of [[General Motors|GMC]] 6-71 straight six engines,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the M4A6 a [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] RD1820 [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]].&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; These, plus the M4A4 which used the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] engine, were mostly supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.190 &amp; 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; "M4" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved throughout production without a change to the tank's basic model number; more durable suspension units, safer "wet" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger armor arrangements, such as the M4 Composite, which had a cast front hull section mated to a welded rear hull. British nomenclature differed from that employed by the U.S.

Early Shermans mounted a [[75 mm Gun (US)|75&amp;nbsp;mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun]]. Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 Medium Tank|Medium Tank T20]] as a Sherman replacement, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into Sherman production. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret, with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1]], which reduced the number of HE and smoke rounds carried and increased the number of anti-tank rounds. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer and a new distinctive [[mantlet]] in the original turret. The first standard-production 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, and the first standard-production 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer Sherman was an M4 accepted in February 1944.

In June–July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick armor, and the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun in a new, heavier T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS (horizontal volute spring suspension) suspension with wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS with its experimental E8 designation led to the nickname ''Easy Eight'' for Shermans so equipped. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman; few saw combat, and most remained experimental. Those which saw action included the bulldozer blade for Sherman [[Combat engineering vehicle|dozer tanks]], [[Duplex Drive]] for "swimming" Sherman tanks, R3 flame thrower for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and the [[T34 Calliope|T34 60-tube ''Calliope'' 4.5" rocket launcher]] for the Sherman turret. The British variants (DD's and mine flails) were among "[[Hobart's Funnies]]," named after their commander, [[Percy Hobart]] of the [[79th Armoured Division]]. [[Image:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|right|A M4A3R3 used by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].]]

The M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 "tow truck"-style [[armoured recovery vehicle|recovery tanks]] with winches, booms, and an 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) [[artillery tractor|artillery prime movers]]; [[M7 Priest|M7B1]], [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|M12]], [[M40 GMC|M40, and M43]] self-propelled artillery; and the [[M10 Wolverine|M10]] and [[M36 Jackson|M36]] tank destroyers.

The M4 Sherman served with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during World War II. The U.S. also supplied large numbers to the various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] countries. Shermans were used during the war by British and Commonwealth armies, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]], [[Free France|Free French]] forces, the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Polish Armed Forces in the West#Army|army in exile]], [[China]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]], and [[Brazil]]'s  [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Expeditionary Force]].

The U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline-powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Sherman tanks be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The U.S. Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 to be the primary [[Lend-Lease]] exports.

The M4A1 Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4A1s in [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']] the next month. At this time, Shermans successfully engaged German Panzer IIIs with long barreled 50mm L60 guns, and Panzer IVs with short barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm L24 guns. Additional M4 and M4A1s replaced M3 Lees in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaigns. However, by June 1944, most German tanks were up-gunned and 75&amp;nbsp;mm Shermans were outgunned. The M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war.

The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun (July 1944) was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS Sherman to see combat was the M4A3E8(76)W in December 1944. The M4A3E8 (76)W was arguably the best of the US Sherman tanks.

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

Hoffman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/to-save-humanity-9780190221546?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=To Save Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transnational citizenship''' redefines traditional notions of [[citizenship]] and replaces an individual's singular national loyalties with the ability to belong to multiple [[nation state]]s, as made visible in the political, cultural, social and economic realms. Unlike national citizenship, where individuals interact in such capacities with one [[sovereign state]], transnational citizenship transcends pre-established territorial boundaries in order to create a modern meaning of "belonging" in an increasingly globalized society. Additionally, while preconceived notions of citizenship are often divided between national, social and individual forms of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], all three categories serve to contribute to the meaning of transnational citizenship. State citizenship can be defined as an individual establishing their sense of belonging by espousing to the liberal-democratic values of the state in the public sphere. When applied to transnational citizenship, an individual would have the opportunity to be civically engaged in multiple societies. A Dominican politician who lives in [[Santo Domingo]] yet canvasses in a highly dense [[Dominican American]] population in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] for external votes is an example of a transnational citizens functioning politically between two states.

In terms of the categories of social and individual forms of belonging, transnational citizens are marked by multiple identities and allegiances, and often travel between two or more countries, all in which they have created sizeable networks of differing functions. Similar to global or cosmopolitan citizenship, it is composed of cross-national and multi-layered memberships to certain societies. Transnational citizenship is based on the idea that a new global framework consistent of subgroups of national identities will eventually replace membership to one sole nation-state. In a hyper-realized version of transnational citizenship, "states become intermediaries between the local and the global." Institutionalizing transnational citizenship would loosen ties between territories and citizenship and would ultimately result in a reconstruction of [[world government|world order]] that forever changes the capacity in which individuals interact with [[government institution]]s.

==History and causes==

While some relate transnational citizenship to any historic shift or fusion of identities within nation-states, modern conceptions of the term have only surfaced in the past twenty years. Many attribute the evolution of the term to the rising situation of [[globalization]]. Globalization is defined by a heightened international access to the world [[capital market]] system and increased abilities to more rapid forms of [[communication]]. Due to the convenience and ease of modern international exchanges, globalization has become the process by which international economies as well as individuals interact with one another. Since post-[[Cold War]] 1989, the evolved "global political economy" has resulted in massive "reconfigurations of the world's arenas". Globalization transformed a confined [[geo-political]] system into one that relies heavily on multiple levels of local, national and global interactions. For example, [[China]]'s [[industrialization]] from an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] to a [[manufacturing]] society chronicled by excessive imports and exports contribute to a need to interconnect societies from all corners of the globe. The wealth that private institutions experienced from globalization resulted in "further extensions of [[corporation]]s in search of faraway resources and markets".

Beyond resulting in substantial political and economical shifts, globalization has also affected social and cultural practices between people. According to citizenship scholars like Andrew Vandenberg, such acts of globalization eventually "ended the constraints of space and time that conditioned all earlier human transactions, practices, and therefore identities. With the growth and distribution of [[technology]], more people all over the world have come to establish personal relationships with one another. Former state-regulated formal encounters are now replaced by modern informal and all the more frequent interactions. Rapid world [[economic growth]] has consequently led to [[Human migration|international migrations]]. In recent years, in conjunction with globalization, increased instances of uncontrolled and predominantly illegal international migrations contribute to opportunities for escalating transnational identities. Because obvious ties surface between [[immigrant]]s, their home countries, and the receiving countries, the civic ramifications are widespread. Thus international immigration contributes to loosening individual state ties. Once in their host countries, immigrants form [[social network]]s while maintaining ties to their homeland. Some organizations function in both countries, which serves to further enhance the notion that international migrants act as transnational citizens in multiple lands.

==V. multiculturalism==

It is important to draw a distinction between transnational citizenship and [[multiculturalism]] among national citizens. While transnational citizens bring cultural and societal elements of their home countries to their host countries and vice versa, multiculturalism results from the fusion of differing [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] or [[indigenous people]]s on a micro scale of a particular local environment. These interactions are described as "crosscutting and always mutually situational identifications." Therefore, ethnic minorities and majorities alike intermingle in a mutually shared space. All different types of individuals function within the same system, and eventually collective national identities are formed. On the other hand, transnational citizens live within the context of two or more societies that differ in size, scope, populations, laws, morals, and cultural codes. While transnational citizens interact with those already present in each respective community, they are functioning within divergent spaces. They base their interactions more on the need to reconcile two completely diverse localities into a greater context that traverses international borders, politics, and ways of life.

==The European Union as a test case==

"The question for the future of citizenship is whether a 'global' citizenship can transcend citizenships defined by 'local' stages on the basis of blood and birth through an act of the state itself." — Henry Teune

Some scholars consider the creation of the [[European Union]] as the pilot case for testing Teune's question about whether or not transnational citizenship can surpass national citizenship. Starting in the early 1980s, European national migration control officials met and established a consensus over the relationship between migration, [[right of asylum|asylum]] and [[crime]]. The control officials deemed migration as a security issue, and called for a "[[multi-level governance]]" in order to control migratory practices. Virginie Guiraudon generates the theory of "venue-shopping" in order to describe how cross-national policies prevailed. Venue-shopping is the process by which political members seek out specific governmental settings in order to establish their ideal policy outcomes. Political actors circumvented national levels of control in order to establish a "transnational cooperation" among nation-states. Starting in 1981, citizens with [[passport]]s from European countries were able to move freely across borders into other European countries. Due to the increased ease of traversing borders, the "[[Europeanization]]" of individuals began to occur in which a new transnational identity could be conceived.

The creation of the European Union only accelerated growing notions of transnational citizenship across the continent. The European Union came into being on November 1, 1993, when European nations signed the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] into law. The treaty established "community policy" in six new areas, one of which is termed "trans-European networks." The treaty also discusses the specific effects of the merger on a new formation of [[European citizen]]ship. The benefits of European citizenship include the ability for citizens to freely cross borders into and subsequently reside in other European countries, the right to vote in elections and run for office in both municipal and [[European elections]] in the state in which the citizen resides, the right to access any member country's diplomatic or consular services in a third-party country in which the citizen's birth nation is not represented, and the citizen's right to petition to the [[European parliament]]. The treaty thus instituted "European citizenship over and above national citizenship". This ultimately facilitates a new form of "European identity" that allows for members of the European Union to function as transnational actors beyond their countries' borders, establishing the entire continent as one cohesive entity.

Finally, the creation of the [[Euro (currency)|euro]] serves as the pinnacle of Europe's newfound economic unification. On January 1, 1999, the euro replaced the pre-existing currency in 11 European countries. The Treaty of Maastricht also created the [[European System of Central Banks]], which consists of the Central European Bank and national [[central bank]]s working together to establish monetary policy across participating countries. Some scholars consider the act of unifying the currency as "culminating the progress toward economic and monetary union in Europe". While the aspect of [[monetary union]] is clear, the far-reaching effects of [[economic union]] between countries could be considered a cause for debate. Regardless, the euro allows for transnational citizens of the European Union to not only move freely across borders, but also to experience easier monetary exchanges through the ability to use a currency that is present in both the citizens' home and host countries. The political, economic, and social ramifications that result from the invention of the European Union help contribute to the construction of European citizens as the international model for transnational citizenship.

A '''universal chronicle''' or '''world [[chronicle]]''' traces history from the beginning of written information about the past up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;History begins at the point where monuments become intelligible and documentary evidence of a trustworthy character is fortheoming but from this point onwards the domain is boundless for Universal History as understood. (Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks by [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Preface, pg. x)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Universal history embraces the events of all times and nations in so far as [[Scientific method|scientific treatment]] of them is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke. ''Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks''. Scribner, 1884.
''An epitome of universal history'' by A. Harding. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal history in the Western tradition is commonly divided into three parts, viz. [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[Postclassical Era|medieval]], and [[Modern history|modern]] time.&lt;ref name="EoUHfHIiRafSI"&gt;H. M. Cottinger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ Elements of universal history for higher institutes in republics and for self-instruction]. [[Charles H. Whiting]], 1884. pg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1]+.&lt;/ref&gt; The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with [[Karl Jaspers]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin and Goal of History'', (London: Yale University Press, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the [[Axial Age]] synchronous to "classical antiquity" of the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel N. Eisenstadt, ''Axial Age Civilizations'', (New York: New York State University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization—prehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods.

G. Wells, ''[[The Outline of History]]''}}

The roots of [[historiography]] in the 19th century are bound up with the concept that history written with a strong connection to the [[primary source]]s could [[Research|be integrated]] with "the big picture", i.e. to a general, universal history. For example, [[Leopold von Ranke]], probably the pre-eminent historian of the 19th century, founder of '''Rankean historical positivism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zubin Meer (ed.), ''Individualism: The Cultural Logic of Modernity'', Lexington Books, 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;, the classic mode of historiography that now stands against [[postmodernism]], attempted to write a Universal History at the close of his career. The works of world historians [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] are examples of attempts to integrate primary [[Source text|source-based]] history and Universal History. Spengler's work is more general; Toynbee created a theory that would allow the study of "civilizations" to proceed with integration of [[Recorded history|source-based history writing]] and Universal History writing.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Yerxa. ''Recent Themes in World History and the History of the West: Historians in Conversation''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2009. Page 1+&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers attempted to incorporate [[teleology|teleological theories]] into general presentations of the history. Toynbee found as the ''telos'' (''goal'') of universal history the emergence of a single [[World State]].

==Instances and description==

===Ancient examples===

====Hebrew Bible====
A project of Universal history may be seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} 
which from the point of view of its redactors{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} in the 5th century BC presents a history of humankind from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to the [[Noah's flood|Flood]], 
and from there a history of the [[Israelites]] down to [[Second Temple Judaism|the present]]. The [[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]] is a 2nd-century CE rabbinic interpretation of this chronology.

====Greco-Roman historiography====
{{main article|Greco-Roman historiography}}
In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman antiquity]], the first universal history was written by [[Ephorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century BC).  This work has been lost, but its influence can be seen in the ambitions of [[Polybius]] (203–120 BC) and [[Diodorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1st century BC) to give comprehensive accounts of their worlds. [[Herodotus]]' ''History'' is the earliest surviving member of the Greco-Roman world-historical tradition, although under some definitions of universal history it does not qualify as universal because it reflects no attempt to describe an overall direction of history or a principle or set of principles governing or underlying it.  Polybius was the first to attempt a universal history in this stricter sense of the term:
{{quote|
For what gives my work its peculiar quality, and what is most remarkable in the present age, is this: Fortune has gained almost all the affairs of the world in one direction and has forced to incline towards one and the same end; a historian should likewise bring before his readers under one synoptic view the operations by which she has accomplished her general purpose (1:4:1-11).}}
''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] has been considered as a universal history because of its comprehensive chronology—from the [[Cosmogony|creation of mankind]] to the death of [[Julius Caesar]] a year before the poet's birth.&lt;ref name="Solodow 1988, p. 18."&gt;{{cite book|last=Solodow|first=Joseph B.|title=The World of Ovid's Metamorphoses|year=1988|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807817711|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n0vdulnvcvoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sources+for+ovid%27s+metamorphoses&amp;ots=9nFm-L-j6b&amp;sig=u0-D_k9Ytxi_hf3R6Df9WLImfw0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Leipziger Weltchronik|Leipzig]] are preserved five fragments dating to the 2nd century AD and coming from a world chronicle. Its author is unknown, but was perhaps a Christian. Later, universal history provided an influential lens on the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire in such works as [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' ''History Against the Pagans''.

====Chinese historiography====
During the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 220 CE) of [[China]], [[Sima Qian]] (145–86 BC) was the first Chinese historian to attempt a universal history—from the earliest [[Chinese mythology|mythological origins]] of his civilization to [[History of the Han Dynasty|his present day]]—in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''. Although his generation was the first in China to discover the existence of kingdoms in [[Central Asia]] and [[India]], his work did not attempt to cover the history of these regions.

===Medieval examples===

====Western Europe====
The ''universal [[chronicle]]'' traces history from the beginning of the world up to the present and was an especially popular genre of [[historiography]] in [[medieval]] [[Western Europe]]. The universal chronicle differs from the ordinary chronicle in its much broader chronological and geographical scope, giving, in principle, a continuous account of the progress of world history from the creation of the world up to the author's own times, but in practice often narrowing down to a more limited geographical range as it approaches those times.

The [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronica'']] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 275–339) is considered to be the starting point of this tradition. The second book of this work consisted of a set of concordance tables (''Chronici canones'') that for the first time synchronized the several concurrent chronologies in use with different peoples. Eusebius' chronicle became known to the [[Latin]] West through the translation by [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420).

Universal chronicles are sometimes organized around a central [[ideological]] theme, such as the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] idea of the tension between the heavenly and the earthly state, as depicted in the [[City of God (book)|City of God]], which plays a major role in [[Otto von Freising]]'s ''Historia de duabus civitatibus''. Agustine’s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography as it takes place on planet Earth. In this war God moves (by divine intervention/ Providence) those governments, political /ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God)  in order to oppose by all means—including military—those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of Devil).

In other cases, any obvious theme may be lacking. Some universal chronicles bear a more or less [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] character, with many digressions on non-historical subjects, as is the case with the ''Chronicon'' of [[Helinand of Froidmont]].

Other notable universal chroniclers of the Medieval West include [[Bede]] (c. 672 or 673–735), the [[Christherre-Chronik]], [[Helinand of Froidmont]] (c. 1160—after 1229), [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636), [[Jans der Enikel]], [[Matthew Paris]] (c. 1200-1259), [[Ranulf Higdon]] (c. 1280-1363), [[Rudolf von Ems]], [[Sigebert of Gembloux]] (c. 1030–1112), [[Otto von Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), and [[Vincent of Beauvais]] (c. 1190-1264?).

The tradition of universal history can even be seen in the works of medieval historians whose purpose may not have been to chronicle the ancient past, but nonetheless included it in a local history of more recent times.  One such example is the ''[[Decem Libri Historiarum]]'' of [[Gregory of Tours]] (d. 594), where only the first of his ten books describes creation and ancient history, while the last six books focus on events in his own lifetime and region.  While this reading of Gregory is currently a widely accepted hypothesis in historical circles, the central purpose of Gregory's writing is still a topic of hot debate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian. Gregory of Tours. (Bangor: Headstart History, 1994.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kathleen and Wood, Ian, eds.. The World of Gregory of Tours. (Boston: Brill, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historiography of early Islam====
{{main article|Historiography of early Islam}}
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (13th century), universal history in this vein was taken up by [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historians]] such as [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini]] ("The History of The World Conqueror") by [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]], [[Jami al-Tawarikh]] ("Compendium of Chronicles") by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (now held at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) and the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' by Ibn Khaldun.

===Modern historiography===
{{rquote|right|A philosophical attempt to work out a universal history according to a natural plan directed to achieving the civic union of the human race must be regarded as possible and, indeed, as contributing to this end of Nature|[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] - Ninth Thesis&lt;ref&gt;Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early European project was the ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History]]'' of [[George Sale]] and others, written in the mid-18th century.

Christian writers as late as [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] in his ''Discours sur l'histoire universelle''  ([[Speech of Universal History]]) are still reflecting on and continuing the Medieval tradition of universal history.&lt;ref&gt;Bossuet, J. B. ''[https://archive.org/details/discourssurlhist01boss Discours sur l'histoire universelle] (Paris, Furne et cie, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;
Speech of Universal History is considered by many Catholics as an actual second edition or continuation of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]]. In this work Bossuet continues to provide an update of universal history according to Augustine’s thesis of universal war between those humans that follow God and those who follow the Devil. This concept of world history guided by [[Divine Providence]] in a universal war between God and Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council']] s [[Gaudium et Spes]] document: "The Church . . . holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings."

In the 19th century, universal histories proliferated.{{dubious|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!--a "general theory of history" is not a "universal history". entirely different topic. But there is much overlapping between the two and universal history can be based on theory of history--&gt;
Philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]" in On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herder]],&lt;ref&gt;''Universal History'', (tr. F. Wilson, New York: 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schiller]] and [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of History'', (tr. Robert S. Hartman, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and political philosophers such as [[Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], presented general theories of history that shared essential characteristics with the Biblical account: they conceived of history as a coherent whole, governed by certain basic characteristics or immutable principles. Kant who was one of the earliest thinkers to use the term ''Universal History'' described its meaning in "[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]":
{{quote|
Whatever concept one may hold...concerning the freedom of the will, certainly its appearances, which are human actions, like every other natural event are determined by universal laws. However obscure their causes, history...permits us to hope that if we attend to the play of freedom of the human will in the large, we may be able to discern a regular movement in it, and that what seems complex and chaotic in the single individual may be seen from the standpoint of the human race as a whole to b a steady and progressive though slow evolution of the original endowment..Each individual and people, as if following some guiding trend, goes toward a natural but to each of them unknown goal...In keeping with this purpose, it might be possible to have a history with a definite natural plan for creatures that have no plan of their own.&lt;ref&gt;On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963, p 11-12); also ''Perpetual Peace'' in: Ibid., (p 106).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ancient history]] is the study of the past from the beginning of [[history of writing|recorded human history]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]].

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html akkadian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H. G. (1921). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a The outline of history, being a plain history of life and mankind] New York: Macmillan company. Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded. The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed, the beginning of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is seen. From the 16th to 11th centuries BC the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] dominated the Nile Valley. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed.

The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region.
During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was underway.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the [[Mannaeans]] Kingdom begins in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] forms in [[Mesopotamia]]. In 800 BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded [[Olympic Games]] are held.

{{Main article|Post-classical era}}

The [[post-classical era]], also known as the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_in_the_Middle_Ages.html?id=U1sMAAAAYAAJ The World in the Middle Ages: An Historical Geography, with Accounts of the Origin and Development, the Institutions and Literature, the Manners and Customs of the Nations in Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa, from the Close of the Fourth to the Middle of the Fifteenth Century]. [[Adolphus Louis Koeppen]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[historical]] [[Periodization|period]] following the [[Iron Age]], fully underway by the 5th century and lasting to the 15th century, and preceding the [[early Modern Era]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Tabular_Views_of_Universal_History.html?id=7jtHAAAAIAAJ Tabular Views of Universal History]. [[George Haven Putnam]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Willard. A system of universal history, in perspective: accompanied by an atlas, exhibiting chronology in a picture of nations, and progressive geography in a series of maps. F. J. Huntington, 1835. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9gEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR5-IA3 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Lang-la|medius}} + {{Lang-la|aevum}} (middle + age); See [[Centre (geometry)|Middle]] and [[Time|Age]].&lt;/ref&gt; history is the middle period, or the middle age, in a three-period division of history: [[Ancient History|Classic]], Medieval,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and [[Modern history|Modern]]. The precise dates of the beginning, culmination, and end of the medieval history are more or less arbitrarily assumed according to the point of view adopted. Any hard and fast line drawn to designate either the beginning or close of the period in question is arbitrary. The widest limits given, viz., the irruption of the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire, for the beginning, and the Middle Ages of the 16th century, for the close, may be taken as inclusively sufficient, and embrace, beyond dispute, every movement or phase of history that can be claimed as properly belonging to the medieval history.

In Europe, the period saw the large-scale [[Migration Period|European Migration]] and [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In South Asia, the [[middle kingdoms of India]] were the classical period of the region. The "Medieval" period on the Indian subcontinent lasts for some 1,500 years, and ends in the 13th century. During the late medieval history, [[Islamic empires in India|several Islamic empires]] were established in the Indian subcontinent. In East Asia, the [[Mid-Imperial China]] age begins with the reunification of China and ends with China was conquered by the [[Mongol Empire]]. The [[Golden Horde]] invaded North and West Asia and parts of eastern Europe in the 13th century and established and maintained their [[khanate]] until the end of the medieval history.

The Early medieval history saw the continuation of trends set up in [[ancient history]] (and, for Europe, [[late Antiquity]]). The period is usually considered to open with those migrations of the German Tribes which led to the destruction of the Roman Empire in the West in 375, when the Huns fell upon the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea and forced the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire on the lower Danube. A later date, however, is sometimes assumed, viz., when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Roman Emperors of the West, in 476.  Depopulation, deurbanization, and increased [[barbarian]] invasion were seen across the [[Old World]]. [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], once part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], became [[Islamic]]. Later in [[European history]], the establishment of the [[feudal system]] allowed a return to systemic agriculture. There was sustained [[urbanization]] in [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].

During the High medieval history in Europe, [[Christian]]-oriented art and architecture flourished and [[Crusades]] were mounted to recapture the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]] control. The influence of the emerging states in Europe was tempered by the ideal of an international [[Christendom]]. The codes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]] set rules for proper European behavior, while the European [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers attempted to reconcile Christian faith and reason.

During the Late medieval history in Europe, the centuries of prosperity and growth came to a halt.
The close of the medieval history is also variously fixed; some make it coincide with the rise of Humanism and the Renaissance in Italy, in the 14th century; with the Fall of Constantinople, in 1453; with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492; or, again, with the great religious schism of the 16th century. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[medieval Great Famine]] and the [[Black Death]], reduced the population around half before the calamities in the late medieval history. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. Western Europe experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. Collectively the events are a [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crisis of the Late medieval history]].

[[Modern history]] describes the historical period after the Middle history.&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the English language, "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval&amp;nbsp;— modern history comprising the history of the world since the close of the Middle history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814 ''The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', Page 3814]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into the ''[[early modern period]]'' and the ''late modern period'' after the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ''[[Contemporary history]]'' describes the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The [[Great Divergence]]&lt;ref&gt;a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the period of time in which the process by which the [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The modern era began approximately in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dunan, Marcel. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Modern History, From 1500 to the Present Day''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman.

==== Early modern age ====
{{Main article|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* [[Protestant reformation|The Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* Rise of [[capitalism]]

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}

As a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]s and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]

The contemporary "[[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]" is a term given to a period starting in late 1970s when inequality grew substantially in the [[United States]] and to a lesser extent in other countries such as [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The term originated with [[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] economist and ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'',  W W Norton &amp; Company, 2007, p.124-8&lt;/ref&gt; and is a reference to the "[[Great Compression]]", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence.

[[File:WWDR4 Global physical and economic water scarcity.png|thumb|upright=2|Global physical and economic water scarcity]]

'''Water scarcity''' is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources to meet [[Capitalism#Supply and demand|water demand]]. It affects every continent and was listed in 2015 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as the largest [[Global Risks Report|global risk]] in terms of potential impact over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/why-world-water-crises-are-a-top-global-risk/ |title=Water crises are a top global risk |publisher=World Economic Forum |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is manifested by partial or no satisfaction of expressed demand, economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of [[groundwater]], and negative impacts on the [[Environment (biology)|environment]].&lt;ref name="FAO2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3015e/i3015e.pdf |title=Coping with water scarcity.

A mere 0.014% of all [[Water distribution on Earth|water on Earth]] is both fresh and easily [[Water supply|accessible]]. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by [[climate change]]) resulting in some very wet and some very dry geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a '''water crisis'''. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.&lt;ref name="weforum17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdo.nl/sites/default/files/Globaliseringsreeks%203%20Water.pdf |title=Water, bron van ontwikkeling, macht en conflict |publisher=NCDO, Netherlands |date=8 January 2012 |access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between [[freshwater]] demand and availability.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Postel, G. C. Daily, P. R. Ehrlich, Human appropriation of renewable fresh water. [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''271''', 785–788 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. G. Savenije, Water scarcity indicators; the deception of the numbers.

Threats |work= WWF |year = 2013 |access-date = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to meet such demand, but [[Spatial analysis|spatial]] and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large, leading to (physical) water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.&lt;ref name="7 billion" /&gt; All causes of water scarcity are related to human interference with the [[water cycle]]. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural [[hydrology|hydrological]] variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of [[economic development]], but, if correctly identified, many of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref name="FAO2012"/&gt;

Some countries have already proven that decoupling water use from [[economic growth]] is possible. For example, in Australia, water consumption declined by 40% between 2001 and 2009 while the economy grew by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="decoupling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.unep.org/northamerica/news/2016/half-world-face-severe-water-stress-2030-unless-water-use-decoupled-economic-growth-says |title=Half the world to face severe water stress by 2030 unless water use is "decoupled" from economic growth, says International Resource Panel |publisher=[[UN Environment]] |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations|UN]] states that governments have tended to invest heavily in largely inefficient solutions: mega-projects like [[dam]]s, [[canal]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, pipelines and water reservoirs, which are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable. The most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for [[government]]s to create [[Systems ecology|holistic]] water [[Integrated water resources management|management plans]] that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, [[Water treatment|treatment]], [[Reclaimed water|recycling]], reuse and return to the environment.&lt;ref name="decoupling" /&gt;

==Supply &amp; demand==
[[File:GlobalWaterWithdrawals.jpg|thumb|Global use of freshwater, 2016 FAO data]]
[[File:Annualglobalwaterconsumption.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Global water consumption 1900-2025, by region, in billions m3 per year]]
The total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth, in the form of [[surface water]] ([[rivers]] and [[lakes]]) or [[groundwater]] (in [[aquifer]]s, for example), is 14.000 cubic kilometres (nearly 3359 cubic miles). Of this total amount, 'just' 5.000 cubic kilometres are being used and reused by humanity. Hence, in theory, there is more than enough freshwater available to meet the demands of the current world population of 7 billion people, and even support [[population growth]] to 9 billion or more. Due to the unequal geographical distribution and especially the unequal consumption of water, however, it is a scarce resource in some parts of the world and for some parts of the population.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

Scarcity as a result of consumption is caused primarily by the extensive use of water in [[agriculture]]/[[Animal husbandry|livestock breeding]] and [[industry]]. People in developed countries generally use about 10 times more water daily than those in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="nextgrcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/08/how-water-shortages-lead-food-crises-conflicts |title=Why fresh water shortages will cause the next great global crisis |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 March 2015 |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this is ''indirect use'' in water-intensive agricultural and industrial production processes of [[consumer goods]], such as fruit, oil seed crops and cotton. Because many of these production chains have been globalised, a lot of water in developing countries is being used and polluted in order to produce goods destined for consumption in developed countries.&lt;ref name="NCDO" /&gt;

==Physical  &amp;  economic scarcity==
Water scarcity can result from two mechanisms:

* [[physical water scarcity|physical (absolute) water scarcity]]
* [[economic water scarcity]]

Physical water scarcity results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity results from poor management of the sufficient available water resources. According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). [http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-2006 Human Development Report 2006: Beyond Scarcity–Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis]. Basingstoke, United Kingdom:Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
Around one fifth of the world's population currently live in regions affected by [[Physical water scarcity]], where there is inadequate water resources to meet a country's or regional demand, including the water needed to fulfill the demand of ecosystems to function effectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200–300 litres daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organisations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&amp;nbsp;km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= Józefów|pages= 235–250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human right to water==
[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated. Many children are deprived of an education primarily due to this daily task.&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/media/media_53234.html Lack of safe water and sanitation in schools affects children’s learning – and their lives] [[Unicef]] Published 5 April 2010.

Retrieved 03 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Further|Right to water}}
The [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] established a foundation of five core attributes for water security. They declare that the human [[right to water]] entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Millennium Development Goals (MDG)===
{{Main|Millennium Development Goals}}
At the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]], the United Nations addressed the effects of economic water scarcity by making increased access to safe drinking water an international development goal. During this time, they drafted the Millennium Development Goals and all 189 UN members agreed on eight goals. MDG 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015. This would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water. In 2016, the  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] replaced the Millennium Development Goals

==Effects on environment==
Water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, including lakes, rivers, wetlands and other fresh water resources. The resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity, often located in areas of irrigation agriculture, harms the environment in several ways including increased [[salinity]], [[nutrient pollution]], and the loss of [[floodplains]] and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html|title = Water Scarcity Index – Vital Water Graphics|accessdate = 20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.E. Lawrence |author2=C.P.W. Pavia |author3=S. Kaing|author4=H.N. Bischel|author5=R.G. Luthy|author6= V.H. Resh |title= Recycled Water for Augmenting Urban Streams in Mediterranean-climate Regions: A Potential Approach for Riparian Ecosystem Enhancement |journal=Hydrological Sciences Journal |year=2014 |volume=59 |pages= 488–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the last hundred years, more than half of the Earth's wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and [[invertebrates]], but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide [[water filtration]] and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the [[Aral Sea]] in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Subsidence, or the gradual sinking of landforms, is another result of water scarcity. The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage. In some areas east of [[Houston, Texas]] the land has dropped by more than nine feet due to subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/scarcity/surprisingcosts.php Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/10/14.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownwood, a subdivision near [[Baytown, Texas]], was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since become part of the [[Baytown Nature Center]].

===Climate change===
[[Aquifer]] drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of [[fossil water]] increases the total amount of water within the hydrosphere subject to transpiration and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.

==Depletion of freshwater resources==
[[File:AralShip.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An abandoned ship in the former [[Aral Sea]], near [[Aral, Kazakhstan]]]]
Apart from the conventional surface water sources of freshwater such as rivers and lakes, other resources of freshwater such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater, becoming the main source of clean water. [[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes. The exponential growth rate of the human population is a main contributing factor in the increasing use of these types of water resources.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2012. ''The United Nations World Water Development Report 4: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater===
Until recent 2015, groundwater was not a highly utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano, M. and Volholth, K. (ed.) 2007. ''The Agricultural Groundwater Revolution''. Wallingford, UK, Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI).&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world.&lt;ref&gt;WWAP (World Water Assessment Programme). 2009. ''Water in a Changing World. World Water Development Report 3.'' Paris/London, UNESCO Publishing/Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable [[buffer capacity]] allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on [[precipitation]] or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. 2007. ''Water for Food, Water for Life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture''. London/Colomb, Earthscan/International Water Management Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Although groundwater sources are quite prevalent, one major area of concern is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. [[Abstracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.

To set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area who uses water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism, and the regular guy getting his water from a well. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don’t waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glaciers===
Glaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]]. Rising global temperatures have noticeable effects on the rate at which glaciers melt, causing glaciers in general to shrink worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K. 2005. The Karakoram Anomaly? Glacier expansion and the ‘elevation effect’, Karakoram Himalaya. Mountain Research and Development, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 332–40&lt;/ref&gt; Although the meltwater from these glaciers are increasing the total water supply for the present, the disappearance of glaciers in the long term will diminish available water resources. Increased meltwater due to rising global temperatures can also have negative effects such as flooding of lakes and dams and catastrophic results.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, K., 1982. Natural Dams and Outburst Floods of the Karakoram Himalaya. Proceedings of the Symposium on Hydrological Aspects of Alpine and High Mountain Areas. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Publication No. 138. Wallingford, UK, IAHS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Collecting clean water in rural Sindh (5367575654).jpg|thumb|right|In 2012 in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] a shortage of clean water led people to queue to collect it where available]]
Hydrologists today typically assess water scarcity by looking at the population-water equation. This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm
 |title       = Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces "water scarcity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' [[FAO]] states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/issues/scarcity.html FAO Hot issues: Water scarcity]. Fao.org. Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank adds that [[climate change]] could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use, thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=21–24 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring water scarcity include examining the physical existence of water in nature, comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use. This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.

Another measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.

===Renewable freshwater resources===
Renewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.

The following table displays the average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.worldwater.org/datav7/data_table_1_total_renewable_freshwater_supply_by_country.pdf|title = Total Renewable Freshwater Supply, by Country|accessdate = 5 November 2013|website = The World's Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; This table represents data from the UN FAO AQUASTAT, much of which are produced by modeling or estimation as opposed to actual measurements.

==Water stress==
[[File:AfriqueStressHydrique2025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|GEO-2000 estimate for 2025, 25 African countries are expected to suffer from water shortage or water stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEO-2000 overview overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a country or region is said to experience "water stress" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.

===Changes in climate===
Another popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A New York Times article, "Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not [[Global Warming]]", summarizes the findings of Columbia University researcher on the subject of the droughts in the American Southeast between 2005 and 2007. The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall. Census figures show that Georgia’s population rose from 6.48 to 9.54 million between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Dean, Cornelia (2 October 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/science/earth/02drought.html Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming]. ''NY Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying data from weather instruments, computer models, and tree ring measurements, they found that the droughts were not unprecedented and result from normal climate patterns and random weather events. "Similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years", the researchers wrote, "Regardless of [[climate change]], they added, similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, with similar results."&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; As the temperature increases, rainfall in the Southeast will increase but because of [[evaporation]] the area may get even drier. The researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables.

==Water crisis==
When there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet"&gt;[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet]. Peopleandplanet.net (11 November 2002). Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises of global concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17551&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1 |title=World water crisis worsened by corruption, repression: UN report |publisher=Un.org |date=20 February 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603001032/http://www.nrdc.org/international/summit/summit3.asp UN World Summit on Sustainable Development]. Released by NRDC at the World Summit for Sustainable Development, 29 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], argue that there are no water crises in such places, but steps must still be taken to avoid one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2003/15254-en.html "No global water crisis – but may developing countries will face water scarcity"]. FAO.org. 12 March 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of water crisis===
There are several principal manifestations of the water crisis.
* Inadequate access to safe [[drinking water]] for about 885 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/Joint_Monitoring_Report_-_17_July_2008.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inadequate access to [[sanitation]] for 2.5 billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_44093.html |title=Updated Numbers: WHO-UNICEF JMP Report 2008 |publisher=Unicef.org |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often leads to [[water pollution]]
* [[Groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] (excessive use) leading to diminished [[agriculture|agricultural]] yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/WORMKA/ |title=Water is Life – Groundwater drawdown |publisher=Academic.evergreen.edu |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overuse and [[pollution]] of water resources harming [[biodiversity]]
* Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in [[war]]fare.

[[Waterborne diseases]] caused by lack of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, waterborne diseases are a leading cause of death. According to the [[World Bank]], 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply, but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity.

A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis, saying "There is enough water for everyone" and "Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title=Public Services
 | publisher=Gapminder video
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.&lt;ref&gt;Segerfeldt, Fredrik (25 August 2005), [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4462 "Private Water Saves Lives"], ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (1 August 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/running-out-of-water.html "Running Out of Water"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetland, David (14 July 2008) [http://aguanomics.com/2008/07/water-crisis.html "Water Crisis"]. aguanomics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources. [[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a "[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]" of wetlands.

In [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].

[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]

On [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that "run red" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.
In October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.

===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===
There are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water. The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations (numerical population of affected population listed) whose only consumption is of contaminated water:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/about/sgreport-pdf/03_SafeDrinkingWater_D7341Insert_English.pdf Safe Drinking Water]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sudan]] (12.3 million)
* [[Venezuela]] (5.0 million)
* [[Ethiopia]] (2.7 million)
* [[Tunisia]] (2.1 million)
* [[Cuba]] (1.3 million)
Several world maps showing various aspects of the problem can be found in this [https://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2670/26700101.jpg graph] article.&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Jonathan (28 August 2008) [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-looming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html "Looming water crisis simply a management problem"]. ''[[New Scientist]]'', pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[Chinese water crisis|China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331153400/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Seg/PB2ch03_ss6.htm |archivedate=2009-03-31 |title=Water Scarcity Crossing National Borders |author=Brown, Lester R.|publisher=Earth Policy Institute|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits — [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Mexico, and Pakistan.

According to a UN climate report, the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] glaciers that are the sources of [[Asia]]'s biggest rivers – [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween]] and [[Yellow]] – could disappear by 2035 as temperatures rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm |title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion |publisher=Planetark.com |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that the source used by the UN climate report actually stated 2350, not 2035.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8387737.stm|title=Himalayan glaciers melting deadline 'a mistake' |date=5 December 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2009|first=Pallava|last=Bagla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090215045754/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 Big melt threatens millions, says UN]. peopleandplanet.net. 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; India, China, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.

==Outlook==
[[File:Madagascar well.jpg|thumb|Wind and solar power such as this installation in a village in northwest [[Madagascar]] can make a difference in safe water supply.]]

Construction of [[wastewater treatment]] plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.

Reducing groundwater overdrafting is usually politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, something the world can ill-afford given the current population.

At more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.

A range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Barry (1 December 2012), http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf  ''easy Jet Traveler''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global experiences in managing water crisis==
{{Essay-like|date=September 2009|section}}

It is alleged that the likelihood of conflict rises if the rate of change within the basin exceeds the capacity of institution to absorb that change.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com" /&gt; Although water crisis is closely related to regional tensions, history showed that acute conflicts over water are far less than the record of cooperation.

The key lies in strong institutions and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, proving to be a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.

One common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a "need-based" instead of a "right–based" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, technicalities of projects define "needs". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the Jordan River Basin, which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River. A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view, move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum, integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits.

The Blue Peace framework developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Turkish Review'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue+Peace_Middle+East.pdf|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deza.admin.ch/en/Home/Projects/Selected_projects/Water_management_and_peace_promotion_in_the_Middle_East eda.base.components.templates.base.accessKeys].

The '''''World Radio TV Handbook''''', also known as '''''WRTH''''', is a [[directory (databases)|directory]] of virtually every [[Radio station|radio]] and [[TV station]] on Earth, published yearly. It was started in 1947 by [[Oluf Lund Johansen]] (1891–1975) as the ''World Radio Handbook'' (WRH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oz6gh.byethost33.com/lund_johansen.htm O. Lund-Johansen], presented by OZ6GH.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "TV" was added to the title in 1965, when [[Jens M. Frost]] (1919–1999) took over as editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswci.org/specials/membersofhonour/jens_frost.html DSWCI Member of Honour:  Jens M. Frost]&lt;/ref&gt; It had then already included data for [[television broadcasting]] for some years. After the 40th edition in 1986, Frost handed over editorship to [[Andrew G. Sennitt|Andrew G. (Andy) Sennitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html Andy Sennitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225753/http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html |date=2012-02-08 }}, own presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition that bears an edition number is the 4th edition, published in 1949. The three previous editions appear to have been:
* the 1st edition, marked "Winter Ed. 1947" on the cover and completed in November 1947
* the 2nd edition, marked "1948 (May-November)" on the cover and completed in May 1948
* the 3rd edition, marked "1948-49" on the cover and completed in November 1948.

Summer Supplements appear to have been issued from 1959 through 1971. From 1959 through 1966 they were called the Summer Supplement. From 1967 through 1971 they were called the Summer Edition.

Through the 1969 edition, the WRTH indicated the date on which the manuscript was completed.

Issues with covers in Danish are known to have been available for the years 1948 May-November (2d ed.), 1950-51 (5th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), 1952 (6th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), and probably others. The 1952 English ed., which is completely in English, has an extra page with world times and agents, and ads in English which are sometimes different from the ads in the Danish edition. Also, the 1953 ed. mentions the availability of a German edition.

[[Oluf Lund Johansen]] published, in conjunction with [[Libreria Hispanoamericana]] of [[Barcelona]], Spain, a [[softbound]] Spanish-language version of the 1960 WRTH. The book was printed in Spain and called ''Guia Mundial de Radio y Television'', and carried the WRTH logo at the time as well as all the editorial references contained in the English-language version. 

Hardbound editions are known to have been available for the years 1963 through 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1975-1978, and probably others.

[[File:20 Largest economies pie chart.pdf|thumb|310px|20 largest economies pie  [[Chartism|chart]]{{clarify|date=May 2018}}]]
The '''world economy''' or '''global economy''' is the [[economy]] of the world, considered as the international exchange of goods and services that is expressed in monetary units of account.&lt;ref&gt;"World Economy." – Definition. American English Definition of with Pronunciation by Macmillan Dictionary. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, the two terms are distinguished: the "international" or "global economy" being measured separately and distinguished from [[country|national]] economies while the "world economy" is simply an aggregate of the separate countries' measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely. It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of [[Earth]].

It is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to [[Economics|human economic activity]] and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research or government cooperation makes establishing figures difficult. Typical examples are [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]] and other [[underground economy|black market goods]], which by any standard are a part of the world economy, but for which there is by definition no legal market of any kind.

However, even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish a monetary value, economists do not typically use the current or official [[exchange rate]] to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect [[world]]wide value, for example in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government.

[[File:´World Bank, icp 2011 gdp ppp world share.png|thumb|310px|World share of GDP ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) ([[World Bank]], 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPEXT/Resources/ICP_2011.html|title=The International Comparison Program (ICP)|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rather, market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of [[Purchasing power parity|purchasing power]]. This is the method used below, which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of [[purchasing power parity|real]] [[United States dollar]]s or [[euro]]s. However, the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways. It is unclear, for example, how many of the world's [[world population|7.62 billion people]] have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations.

According to Maddison, until the middle of 19th century, global output was dominated by China and India. Waves of [[Industrial Revolution]] in Western Europe and Northern America shifted the shares to the Western Hemisphere. As of 2017, the following 15 countries or regions have reached an economy of at least US$2 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] by GDP in nominal or PPP terms: [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx|title=Gross domestic product, current prices &amp; Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) valuation of country GDP|work=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=October 2015|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic studies ==
To promote exports, many government agencies publish on the web economic studies by sector and country. Among these agencies include the [[United States Commercial Service|USCS]] (US DoC) and [[Foreign Agricultural Service|FAS]] (USDA) in the United States, [[Export Development Canada|EDC]] and [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|AAFC]] in Canada, [[Ubifrance]] in France, [[UKTI]] in the UK, [[HKTDC]] and [[JETRO]] in Asia, [[Austrade]] and [[NZTE]] in Oceania. Through Partnership Agreements, the Federation of International Trade Associations  publishes studies from several of these agencies (USCS, FAS, AAFC, UKTI and HKTDC) as well as other non-governmental organizations on its website [[GlobalTrade.net]].

The shaded regions correspond to range of projections by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs; for example, it estimates that the world population will reach 8 billion between 2022 and 2035.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references. Readers need to see the resources for themselves, to see such things as prediction variation, stability, and source. If you are of a mind to do something, just elaborate on the text and spread the references out. It's what I'd do if I had the time, but this exercise has used up as much time as I can spare--&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldPopProspects&gt;

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Five billion===
'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

===Six billion===
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which the [[world population]] reached six billion.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19991012/aponline181217_000.htm |title=World Population Hits 6 billion| author=Edith M.

Demographers do not universally accept this date as being exact.  In fact there has been subsequent research which places the day of six billion nearer to 18 June or 19 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~galen/popclk.html |title=Population Clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Programs division of the United States Census Bureau estimated that the world population reached six billion on 21 April 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  United Nations Population Fund spokesman Omar Gharzeddine disputed the date of the Day of Six Billion by stating, "The U.N. marked the '6 billionth' [person] in 1999, and then a couple of years later the Population Division itself reassessed its calculations and said, actually, no, it was in 1998."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News |url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/28/8525681-7-billion-people-how-do-they-know |title=Cosmic Log – 7 billion people?

On the Day of Six Billion, [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] was in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina to monitor the [[Dayton Agreement]].&lt;ref name="unsgt2204"/&gt; At midnight he went to Koševo Hospital, where '''Adnan Mević''', born at 12.01&amp;nbsp;am, was named the symbolic 6 billionth concurrently alive person on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name="unsgt2204"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991014.sgt2204.doc.html|title=The Secretary-General, in two-day stopover in Sarajevo, confers with local leaders, United Nations Representative|date=12 October 1999|publisher=United Nations|pages=SG/T/2204|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc472704"/&gt;  He is the first son of Fatima Mević and Jasminko Mević and weighed 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="bbc472704"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/472704.stm World UN chief welcomes six billionth baby]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and regional population==
{{See also|List of population milestones by country}}
National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s. Commentators in countries with high [[immigration]] have pointed out that a population milestone may be reached by an immigrant rather than [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/australias-population-reaches-24-million/7170274|title=Australia's population hits 24 million people, ABS clock shows|date=2016-02-16|work=[[ABC Online]] |quote=The ABS said it was unclear whether the 24 millionth Australian was a newborn or a migrant|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/baby-reed-is-one-in-23-million-almost/story-fngr8hax-1226627384262|title=Baby Reed is one in 23 million as Australia's population hits a milestone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location= Sydney, Australia |quote=He said the 23rd millionth person could be a newborn but could equally be a person coming to work in Australia or a returning backpacker who had been away for more than a year.|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero world government''' refers to a hypothetical future in which [[central government|national governments]] cease to exist or to matter, as a result of [[globalization]] and a worldwide rejection of politics, as known today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The term contrasts with that of one [[world government]] in the sense that rather than there being a world-[[state (polity)|state]], there are no political states in the world.
