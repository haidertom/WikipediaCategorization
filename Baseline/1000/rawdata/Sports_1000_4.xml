'''Amateur sports''' are [[sport]]s in which participants engage largely or entirely without [[remuneration]]. The distinction is made between amateur sporting participants and [[professional sports|professional]] sporting participants, who are paid for the time they spend competing and training. In the majority of sports which feature professional players, the professionals will participate at a higher standard of play than amateur competitors, as they can train full-time without the stress of having another job. The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs. 

Sporting amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the 19th century, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century with the continuing growth of pro sports and monetisation of amateur and collegiate sports, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organisations governing sports, even as they maintain the word "[[amateur]]" in their titles.

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date = November 2014}}
Modern organized sports developed in the 19th century, with the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] taking the lead. Sporting culture was especially strong in private schools and universities, and the upper and middle class men who attended those institutions played as amateurs. Opportunities for working classes to participate in sport were restricted by their long six-day work weeks and Sunday Sabbatarianism. In the UK, the [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] of 1844 gave working men half a day off, making the opportunity to take part in sport more widely available. Working class sportsmen found it hard to play top level sport due to the need to turn up to work.  On occasion, cash prizes, particularly in individual competitions, could make up the difference;&lt;ref&gt;(looking for citation to prizes of a trophy filled with silver dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; some competitors also wagered on the outcomes of their matches. As professional teams developed, some clubs were willing to make "broken time" payments to players, ''i.e.'', to pay top sportsmen to take time off work, and as attendances increased, paying men to concentrate on their sport full-time became feasible. Proponents of the amateur ideal deplored the influence of money and the effect it has on sports. It was claimed that it is in the interest of the professional to receive the highest amount of pay possible per unit of performance, not to perform to the highest standard possible where this does not bring additional benefit.

The middle and upper class men who dominated the sporting establishment not only had a theoretical preference for amateurism, they also had a self-interest in blocking the professionalization of sport, which threatened to make it feasible for the working classes to compete against themselves with success. Working class sportsmen didn't see why they shouldn't be paid to play. Hence there were competing interests between those who wished sport to be open to all and those who feared that professionalism would destroy the 'Corinthian spirit'. This conflict played out over the course of more than one hundred years. Some sports dealt with it relatively easily, such as [[golf]], which decided in the late 19th century to tolerate competition between amateurs and professionals, while others were traumatized by the dilemma, and took generations to fully come to terms with professionalism even to a result of causing a breakdown in the sport (as in the case of [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] in 1895).

=== Corinthian ===
''Corinthian'' has come to describe one of the most virtuous of amateur athletes—those for whom fairness and honor in competition is valued above victory or gain.  The Corinthian Yacht Club (now the [[Royal Corinthian Yacht Club]], RCYC) was established in Essex in 1872 with "encouragement of Amateur Yacht sailing" as its "primary object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=140 years of amateur yachting excellence…|url=http://royalcorinthian.co.uk/history/|publisher=Royal Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, club rules ensured that crews consisted of amateurs, while "no professional or paid hand is allowed to touch the tiller or in any way assist in steering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabe|first=Julius|title=Yachting: Historical Sketches of the Sport|date=1902|publisher=Lippincott|pages=110–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=corinthian&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the RCYC website derives the name ''Corinthian'' from the [[Isthmian Games]] of [[ancient Corinth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalcorinthian.co.uk/article/4000001/the-formation-of-the-club|title=The formation of the Corinthian Yacht Club|publisher=Royal Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] derives the noun ''Corinthian'' from "the proverbial [[Classical Corinth|wealth, luxury, and licentiousness]] of ancient Corinth", with senses developing from "a wealthy man" (attested in 1577) through "a licentious man" (1697) and "a man of fashion about town" (1819)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egan|first=Pierce|title=Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|date=1823|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2xJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT92}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "a wealthy amateur of sport who rides his own horses, steers his own yacht, etc" (1823). [[Dixon Kemp]] wrote in ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'' published in 1900, "The term Corinthian half a century ago was commonly applied to the aristocratic [[patron]]s of sports, some of which, such as [[Boxing|pugilism]], are not now the fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|title=A Maual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1900|publisher=H. Cox|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Corinthian ideal" of the [[gentleman]] amateur developed alongside [[muscular Christianity]] in late Victorian Britain, and has been analysed as a historical social phenomenon since the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=D. J.|title=On The Corinthian Spirit: The Decline of Amateurism in Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8aoY8Foyy0C&amp;pg=PT1|accessdate=15 September 2017|date=2010-08-31|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781409020684 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] founded in 1882 was the paragon of this. In the United States, "Corinthian" came to be applied in particular to amateur yachtsman, and remains current as such and in [[Corinthian Yacht Club (disambiguation)|the name of many yacht clubs]]; including [[Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club]] (founded 1874, added "Corinthian" to name in 1881)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History By past Commodore P. James Roosevelt|url=http://www.seawanhaka.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=225433&amp;ssid=73261&amp;vnf=1|publisher=Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale Corinthian Yacht Club]] (likewise 1881 and 1893).

==Present day==&lt;!-- [[Shamateurism]] links here --&gt;
By the early 21st century the [[Olympic Games]] and all the major team sports accepted professional competitors. However, there are still some sports which maintain a distinction between amateur and professional status with separate competitive leagues. The most prominent of these are [[golf]] and [[boxing]]. In particular, only amateur boxers could compete at the Olympics up to 2016.

Problems can arise for amateur sportsmen when sponsors offer to help with an amateur's playing expenses in the hope of striking lucrative endorsement deals with them in case they become professionals at a later date. This practice, dubbed "'''shamateurism'''", was present as early as in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="GardinerBoyes2012"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Simon |last1=Gardiner|first2=Simon |last2=Boyes|first3=Urvasi |last3=Naidoo|first4=John |last4=O'Leary |first5=Roger |last5=Welch|title=Sports Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-zGBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT284|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-58812-9|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial and political stakes in high-level were becoming higher, shamateurism became all the more widespread, reaching its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, when the International Olympic Committee started moving towards acceptance of professional athletes. The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

==North American collegiate athletics==
{{Main|College athletics}}

All North American university sports are conducted by amateurs.  Even the very most commercialized college sports, such as [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college football|football]] and [[college basketball|basketball]], do not financially compensate competitors, although coaches and trainers generally are paid. College football coaches in Texas and other states are often the highest paid state employees, with some drawing salaries of over five million US dollars annually. [[Athletic scholarship]] programs, unlike academic scholarship programs, cannot cover more than the cost of food, housing, tuition, and other university-related expenses. 

In order to ensure that the rules are not circumvented, stringent rules restrict gift-giving during the recruitment process as well as during and even after a collegiate athlete's career; college athletes also cannot endorse products, which some{{who|date=May 2017}} may consider a violation of free speech rights.

Some{{who|date=May 2017}} have criticised this system as exploitative; prominent university athletics programs are major commercial endeavors, and can easily rake in millions of dollars in profit during a successful season. College athletes spend a great deal of time "working" for the university, and earn nothing from it at the time aside from scholarships sometimes worth tens of thousands of dollars; basketball and football coaches, meanwhile, earn salaries that can compare with those of professional teams' coaches.

Supporters of the system say that college athletes can always make use of the education they earn as students if their athletic career doesn't pan out, and that allowing universities to pay college athletes would rapidly lead to deterioration of the already-marginal academic focus of college athletics programs. They also point out that athletic scholarships allow many young men and women who would otherwise be unable to afford to go to college, or would not be accepted, to get a quality education. Also, most sports other than football and men's basketball do not generate significant revenue for any school (and such teams are often essentially funded by football, basketball, and donations), so it may not be possible to pay athletes in all sports. Allowing pay in some sports but not others could result in the violation of U.S. laws such as [[Title IX]].

==Olympics==
{{main|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}
Through most of the 20th century the Olympics allowed only amateur athletes to participate and this amateur code was strictly enforced - [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of [[track and field]] medals for having taken expense money for playing baseball in 1912.

Later on, the nations of the [[Communist bloc]] entered teams of Olympians who were all nominally [[student]]s, [[soldier]]s, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.

Near the end of the 1960s, the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team's full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). [[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players&lt;ref name="Num17"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html Story #17–Protesting amateur rules, Canada leaves international hockey].&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1970 World Championships in [[Montreal]] and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-40.html Story #40–Finally, Canada to host the World Championship].&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey's status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt; In response, Canada withdrew from all international ice hockey competitions and officials stated that they would not return until "open competition" was instituted.&lt;ref name="Num17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Summit Series '72 Summary |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130920/http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummarySUM1972.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Günther Sabetzki]] became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow "open competition" between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics, because of the unwillingness of the NHL to take a break mid-season and the IOC's amateur-only policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|Szemberg|2008}}, [http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-6.html Story #6–First Canada Cup opens up the hockey world].&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, a dispute formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted a rule that made any player who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, as long as they had not played in any NHL games.&lt;ref name="Pod1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|1997|pp=147–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the [[World Hockey Association]]—were allowed to play.&lt;ref name="Pod1984"/&gt; Canadian hockey official [[Alan Eagleson]] stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eagleson upset over hockey dispute|work=The New York Times|author=Litsky, Frank|date=1984-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Costello]] of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Canada considers hockey withdrawal|work=The New York Times|date=1984-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Players in NHL are now eligible in the Olympics|work=Toronto Star|author=Monsebraaten, Laurie|date=1986-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr01.htm|title=Amateurism|date=1999-07-12|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1972 retirement of [[IOC]] President [[Avery Brundage]], the Olympic amateurism rules were steadily relaxed, amounting only to technicalities and lip service, until being completely abandoned in the 1990s (In the [[United States]], the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] prohibits national governing bodies from having more stringent standards of amateur status than required by international governing bodies of respective sports.  The act caused the breakup of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] as a wholesale sports governing body at the Olympic level).

Olympic regulations regarding amateur status of athletes were eventually abandoned in the 1990s with the exception of wrestling, where the amateur fight rules are used due to the fact that professional wrestling is largely staged with pre-determined outcomes. Starting from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], professionals were allowed to compete in boxing, though amateur fight rules are still used for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/sports/olympics/olympics-is-opening-its-rings-to-professional-boxers.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==

===England===
English [[first-class cricket]] distinguished between [[History of English amateur cricket|amateur and professional cricketers]] until 1963. Teams below [[Test cricket]] level in England were normally, except in emergencies such as injuries, captained by amateurs. Notwithstanding this, sometimes there were ways found to give high performing "amateurs", for example [[W.G.Grace]], financial and other compensation such as employment.

On English overseas tours, some of which in the 19th century were arranged and led by professional cricketer-promoters such as [[James Lillywhite]], [[Alfred Shaw]] and [[Arthur Shrewsbury]], a more pragmatic approach generally prevailed.

In England the division was reflected in, and for a long time reinforced by, the series of [[Gentlemen v Players]] matches between amateurs and professionals. Few cricketers changed their status, but there were some notable exceptions such as [[Wally Hammond]] who became (or was allowed to become) an amateur in 1938 so that he could captain England.

Professionals were often expected to address amateurs, at least to their faces, as "Mister" or "Sir" whereas the amateurs often referred to professionals by their surnames. Newspaper reports often prefaced amateurs' names with "Mr" while professionals were referred to by surname, or sometimes surname and initials. At some grounds amateurs and professionals had separate dressing rooms and entered the playing arena through separate gates.

After the Second World War the division was increasingly questioned. When [[Len Hutton]] was appointed as [[English national cricket captain]] in 1952 he remained a professional. In 1962 the division was removed, and all cricket players became known as "cricketers".

===Other countries===

In Australia the amateur-professional division was rarely noticed in the years before [[World Series Cricket]], as many top level players expected to receive something for their efforts on the field: before World War 1 profit-sharing of tour proceeds was common. Australian cricketers touring England were considered amateurs and given the title "Mr" in newspaper reports.

Before the [[Partition of India]] some professionalism developed, but talented cricketers were often employed by wealthy princely or corporate patrons and thus retained a notional amateur status.

[[Women's cricket]] is, and always has been, almost entirely amateur.

==Association football==
[[File:Orchard Park playing fields, Hull - geograph.org.uk - 662038.jpg|thumb|right|Public football pitches are common in residential areas, such as this pitch on the [[Orchard Park Estate]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[England]].]]
'''[[Boot money]]''' has been a phenomenon in amateur sport for centuries. The term "boot money" became popularised in the 1880s when it was not unusual for players to find half a crown (corresponding to 12½ pence after [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]]) in their boots after a game.

[[The Football Association]] prohibited paying players until 1885, and this is referred to as the "legalisation" of professionalism because it was an amendment of the "Laws of the Game". However, a maximum salary cap of twelve pounds a week for a player with outside employment and fifteen pounds a week for a player with no outside employment lingered until the 1960s even as transfer fees reached over a hundred thousand pounds; again, "boot money" was seen as a way of topping up pay.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Today the most prominent English football clubs that are not professional are semi-professional (paying part-time players more than the old maximum for top professionals; this includes all the major existing [[women's football (soccer)|women's clubs]], in which full professionalism has not taken root yet) and the most prominent true amateur men's club is probably [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], the oldest football club in Scotland, founded in 1867 and with a home ground ([[Hampden Park]]) which is one of UEFA's five-star stadia. They have also won the Scottish Cup more times than any club outside the [[Old Firm]]. Amateur football in both genders is now found mainly in small village and Sunday clubs and the [[Amateur Football Alliance]].

{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
[[Sailing]] has taken the opposite course. Around the turn of the 20th century, much of sailing was professionals paid by interested idle rich. Today, sailing, especially [[dinghy]] sailing, is an example of a sport which is still largely populated by amateurs. For example, in the recent Team Racing Worlds, and certainly the American Team Racing Nationals, most of the sailors competing in the event were amateurs. While many competitive sailors are employed in businesses related to sailing (primarily sailmaking, naval architecture, boatbuilding and coaching), most are not compensated for their own competitions. In large keelboat racing, such as the Volvo Around the World Race and the America's Cup, this amateur spirit has given way in recent years to large corporate sponsorships and paid crews.

==Figure skating==
Like other Olympic sports, [[figure skating]] used to have very strict amateur status rules.  Over the years, these rules were relaxed to allow competitive skaters to receive token payments for performances in exhibitions (amid persistent rumors that they were receiving more money "under the table"), then to accept money for professional activities such as endorsements provided that the payments were made to trust funds rather than to the skaters themselves.

In 1992, trust funds were abolished, and the [[International Skating Union]] voted both to remove most restrictions on amateurism, and to allow skaters who had previously lost their amateur status to apply for reinstatement of their eligibility.  A number of skaters, including [[Brian Boitano]], [[Katarina Witt]], [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], and [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]] and [[Sergei Grinkov]], took advantage of the reinstatement rule to compete at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].  However, when all of these skaters promptly returned to the pro circuit again, the ISU decided the reinstatement policy was a failure and it was discontinued in 1995.

Prize money at ISU competitions was introduced in 1995, paid by the sale of the [[television]] rights to those events.  In addition to prize money, Olympic-eligible skaters may also earn money through appearance fees at shows and competitions, endorsements, movie and television contracts, coaching, and other "professional" activities, provided that their activities are approved by their national federations.  The only activity that is strictly forbidden by the ISU is participating in unsanctioned "pro" competitions, which the ISU uses to maintain their monopoly status as the governing body in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frogsonice.com/skateweb/faq/rules.shtml#Q6 |title=Competitive Figure Skating FAQ:Rules and Regulations |publisher=Frogsonice.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the skating world still use "turning pro" as jargon to mean retiring from competitive skating, even though most top competitive skaters are already full-time professionals, and many skaters who retire from competition to concentrate on show skating or coaching do not actually lose their competition eligibility in the process.

==Rugby football==

===Background===
Rugby has provided one of the most visible and lasting examples of the tension between amateurism and professionalism during the development of nationally organised sports in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the late-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandrugby.com/twickenham/world-rugby-museum/rugby-history/the-amateur-era/#|title=The Amateur Era|last=|first=|date=|website=England Rugby|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split in rugby in 1895 between what became [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] arose as a direct result of a dispute over the pretence of a strict enforcement of its amateur status - clubs in [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]] were fined after compensating players for missing work, whilst at the same time the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid.{{citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=The 1888 British Isles tour to Australia was a private undertaken and they did not have the blessing of the RFU}}

Rugby football, despite its origins in the privileged English [[Independent school (UK)|public schools]], was a popular game throughout [[England]] by around 1880, including in the large working-class areas of the industrial north. However, as the then-amateur sport became increasingly popular and competitive, attracting large paying crowds, teams in such areas found it difficult to attract and retain good players. This was because physically fit local men needed to both work to earn a wage - limiting the time that they could devote to unpaid sport - and to avoid injuries that might prevent them working in the future. Certain teams faced with these circumstances wanted to pay so-called 'broken time' money to their players to compensate them for missing paid work due to their playing commitments, but this contravened the amateur policy of the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU).

===Organization===
Following a lengthy dispute on this point during the early 1890s, representatives of more than 20 prominent northern rugby clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] in August 1895 to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU), a breakaway administrative body which would permit payments to be made to players. The NRFU initially adopted established RFU rules for the game itself, but soon introduced a number of changes, most obviously a switch from 15 to 13 players per side. It became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922, by which time the key differences in the two codes were well established, with the 13-a-side variant becoming known as rugby league.

The RFU took strong action against the clubs involved in the formation of the NRFU, all of whom were deemed to have forfeited their amateur status and therefore to have left the RFU. A similar interpretation was applied to all players who played either for or against such clubs, whether or not they themselves received any compensation. Such players were effectively barred ''sine die'' from any involvement in organised rugby union. These comprehensive and enduring sanctions, combined with the very localised nature of most rugby competition, meant that most northern clubs had little practical alternative but to affiliate with the NRFU in the first few years of its existence.

Rugby football in Britain therefore became subject to a de facto schism along regional - and to some extent class - lines, reflecting the historical origins of the split. Rugby league - in which professionalism was permitted - was predominant in northern England, particularly in industrial areas, and was viewed as a working class game. Rugby union - which remained amateur - was predominant in the rest of England, as well as in [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Rugby union also had a more affluent reputation, although there are areas - notably in [[South Wales]] and in certain English cities such as [[Gloucester]] - with a strong working-class rugby union tradition.

===Discrimination===
Discrimination against rugby league players could verge on the petty - former Welsh international [[Fred Perrett]] was once excluded in lists of players who died in the First World War due to his 'defection' to the league code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/warstories/pages/rugbyinternationals.shtml Rugby Heroes who went to War] [[BBC Online]] Matthew Ferris, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One [[British House of Commons|Member of Parliament]], [[David Hinchliffe]], described it as "one of the longest (and daftest) grievances in history" with anyone over the age of 18 associated with rugby league being banned forever from rugby union.&lt;ref name="hinch"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/do-i-not-like-that-----hypocrisy-has-to-end-david-hinchliffe-mp-explains-why-he-has-introduced-a-bill-to-stop-rugby-union-discriminating-against-the-league-code-1425064.html|publisher= The Independent|title= Do I not like that . . . / Hypocrisy has to end: David Hinchliffe MP explains why he has introduced a Bill to stop rugby union discriminating against the league code|author=David Hinchliffe|date=1994-06-26|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland and Wales===
The [[Scottish Rugby Union]] was a particular bastion of amateurism and extreme care was taken to avoid the 'taint' of professionalism: a player rejoining the national team after the end of the Second World War applied to be issued with a new shirt and was reminded that he had been ''supplied with a shirt prior to the outbreak of hostilities''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In Wales the position was more equivocal with clubs attempting to stem the tide of players ''going north'' with ''boot money'', a reference to the practice of putting cash payments into player's footwear whilst they were cleaning up after a game. Sometimes payments were substantial. [[Barry John]] was once asked why he hadn't turned professional and responded, "I couldn't afford to."{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Open union===
Rugby union was declared "open" in August 1995 - almost exactly 100 years after the original split occurred - meaning that professionalism has been permitted in both rugby codes since that date. However, while the professional-amateur divide remained in force, there was originally very limited crossover between the two codes, the most obvious occasions being when top-class rugby union players 'switched codes' to rugby league in order to play professionally. Welsh international [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] was a high-profile example of this switch. Since professionalism has been allowed in rugby union the switches have started to come the opposite way. Union has swiftly grown to embrace the professional game with many league players joining union to take a slice of the larger amounts of money available in the sport.

Nowadays, while rugby union no longer makes the professional-amateur distinction, the professional-amateur split still exists within rugby league with the [[British Amateur Rugby League Association]] (BARLA) strictly amateur, though it allows some ex-professionals to play provided they are no longer under contract. The most recent club to get a ban for fielding a contracted professional was Brighouse Rangers who were expelled from the [[National Conference League]] during 2007-2008 season, and the player handed a sine die ban (though in part for gouging &lt;ref&gt;[http://brighouserangers.org.uk/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=108&amp;Itemid=48 ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although the club itself has since been admitted to the Pennine League.

Also, some rugby unions have amateur rules, most notably the [[Argentine Rugby Union]], where all member clubs are amateur. The [[Campeonato Argentino]], the national championship for provincial teams, does not include players contracted to the country's [[Super Rugby]] side, the [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Jaguares]].

Alternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://www.amazon.com/Countercultural-Sports-America-History-Ultimate/dp/3838311957|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What started with a few players, in the sixties, like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a [[Frisbee]], later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized disc sports, in the 1970s,  began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two sports, the team sport of  [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]], and the Freestyle Players Association, are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

[[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] is a [[team sport]] played with a [[flying disc]]. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to members of your own team, on a rectangular field, 120 yards (110m) by 40 yards (37m), until you have successfully completed a pass to a team member in the opposing teams end zone. There are currently over five million people that play some form of organized ultimate in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultimate Frisbee Participation [SFIA]|url=http://sludgeonline.blogspot.com/2013/10/ultimate-frisbee-participation-sfia.html|publisher=Sludge Output|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimate has started to be played semi-professionally with two newly formed leagues, the [[American Ultimate Disc League]] (AUDL) and [[Major League Ultimate]] (MLU).

The game of [[Guts (game)|guts]] was invented by the Healy Brothers in the 1950s and developed at the International Frisbee Tournament (IFT) in [[Marquette, Michigan]]. The game of [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], the most widely played disc game, began in the late 1960s with [[Joel Silver]] and Jared Kass. In the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the [[Ultimate Players Association]] with Dan Roddick, Tom Kennedy and Irv Kalb. [[Double disc court]] was invented and introduced in the early 1970s by Jim Palmeri. In 1974, [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]] competition was created and introduced by [[Ken Westerfield]] and [[Discraft]]s Jim Kenner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Development of Frisbee in Canada|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#appendix1|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the game of [[disc golf]] was standardized with targets called "pole holes" invented and developed by [[Wham-O]]'s Ed Headrick.

==High school sports==

Sports teams commonly exist at the [[high school]] level; students who participate, commonly referred to as [[student athlete]]s, do so during their course of study. Occasionally, sports success in high school sports may lead to a professional career in the field.

The benefit of sports in high school is debated; some believe that they promote discipline and teamwork,&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Fejgin. "Participation in High School Competitive Sports: A Subversion of School Mission or Contribution to Academic Goals?", ''Contemporary Issues in Sociology of Sport''&lt;/ref&gt; while others find that they can cause injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/3/465 |title=Injuries in High School Sports - Garrick and Requa 61 (3): 465 - Pediatrics |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One study on the relationship between high school athletic and academic successes finds that, for the most part, higher participation and success rates in sports is positively related school-wide student successes on academic outcomes such as standardized test scores and educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowen|first=Daniel H.|author2=Greene, Jay P.|title=Does Athletic Success Come at the Expense of Academic Success?|journal=Journal of Research in Education|year=2012|volume=22|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Educational Statistics]] reports that student athletes have a 20% higher chance of completing a college degree, and are more likely to be employed and in better health than non-athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Reports Participation in Varsity Intercollegiate Sports at 4-Year Colleges?|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs/web/97911.asp|publisher=Nation Center for Education Statistic|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of high school athletes in 2006 showed that high school athletes are more likely to cheat inside of the classroom than non-athletes, especially boys participating in football, baseball, and basketball and girls participating in softball and basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey of high school athletes: 2006|url=http://josephsoninstitute.org/sports/programs/survey/|publisher=Josephson Institute Center for Sports Ethics|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey does not indicate to what extent cheating contributes to the greater academic outcomes of high school athletes.

In the world of middle school and high school sports, several fees have risen over the last few years making sports more expensive. The term “Pay-to-Play” means that students and their parents must pay a flat fee to participate, and that fee often leaves out the costs of uniforms, transportation, and other team fees. This affects low-income families (those who earn less than $60,000 per year) and their ability to participate in the sports. The average cost is $381 per child per sport (Pay-to-Play Sports). Physical and mental health can improve with the right amount of physical fitness incorporated into everyday life. It allows for the child to have a healthy developing body, and a BMI within the normal range. Physical activity has been proven to improve mood and decrease both stress and anxiety. Studies have shown that the more physical activity one participates in as a child, the happier and more stable that person will be as an adult. Thus, the more students who participate in school sports, the more students who will find themselves balanced and successful adults later in life.&lt;ref&gt;"Pay-to-play Sports Keeping Lower-income Kids out of the Game." Pay-to-play Sports Keeping Lower-income Kids out of the Game. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golf==
[[Golf]] still has amateur championships, most notably the [[U.S. Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur Championship]], [[British Amateur Championship]], [[U.S. Women's Amateur]], [[British Ladies Amateur]], [[Walker Cup]], [[Eisenhower Trophy]], [[Curtis Cup]] and [[Espirito Santo Trophy]]. However, amateur golfers are far less known than players of professional golf tours such as the [[PGA Tour]] and [[European Tour]]. Still, a few amateurs are invited to compete in open events, such as the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and [[British Open]] or non-open event, such as the [[Masters Tournament]].

==Motorsport==
In motorsports, there are various forms of amateur drivers. When they compete at professional events, they are often referred to as "pay drivers". They have been a presence in [[Formula One]] for many years - drivers such as [[Felipe Nasr]], [[Esteban Gutiérrez]] and [[Rio Haryanto]] bring sponsorship to the tune of $30 million for a seat, even in backmarker teams. In sports car racing, drivers are often seeded into certain categories, including Amateur and Pro-Am classes. The vast majority of these "gentlemen drivers" however tend to participate at club level, often racing historic or classic cars, which are aimed primarily at amateurs.

==Other sports==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
In Ireland, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], or GAA, protects the amateur status of the country's national sports, including [[Gaelic football]], [[Hurling]] and [[Camogie]]. Major [[tennis]] championships prohibited professionals until 1968 but the subsequent admission of professionals virtually eliminated amateurs from public visibility. Paying players was considered disreputable in [[baseball]] until 1869.

== History ==
AVIVA Method was developed by the Hungarian origin Israeli AVIVA Gabriella Steiner after 28 years of research and experiment. She’s brought up by parents, whom, active in sport, taught her to rely on the curing effect of physical movements in case of any health problems. She always believed that as we can control bowel movement and release of urine, it is possible to control the [[Menstruation (mammal)|female periodic cycle]]. She learnt everything about movements as a student of [[Gertrud Kraus]], the world-famous Israeli ballet dancer, then as a ballerina in the Opera House of [[Tel Aviv]], later as a physiotherapist at the Medical University and in the [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah University Clinic]]. Finally, between 1966 and 69 when teaching gymnastic and health restoring exercises for women of 40plus, she could successfully find the key for her exercise system. The discovery happened when her exercises resulted in [[menstruation]] for even those in the group who thought to pass [[menopause]]. Gabriella Steiner then crystallized her technique until she, together with the practicing person, could achieve these results consistently, and she built a series of exercises consisting out of 18 dance looking like steps. [[Toma Sik|Toma Ŝik]],&lt;ref name="Toma Sik"&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Nathaniel|title=Portrait of Toma Sik|url=https://archive.org/details/Toma_Sik|work=Nathaniel Katz|publisher=Aelia Media|accessdate=Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Israeli pacifist, brought the method out from Israel around 1997. Later on, one of Aviva Gabriella Steiner’s students, a Hungarian yoga instructor and PE teacher, Livia Toth combined the method with diet and reached good results with several feminine health problems.
Based on the Aviva Method Adelheid Ohlig developed Luna [[Yoga]].

==Distribution==

=== Indonesia &amp; Philippines ===

==== Current channels ====
'''beIN Sports 1 HD''' will focus on year-round live football with the [[Premier League]] being prominent as well as content from Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs club channels in [[streaming media]]. Other live coverage will come from the [[Serie A]], [[Ligue 1]], [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), the Brazilian national leagues (Paulistao &amp; Brasileirão) (2013-2015), as well as major cup tournaments such as the [[FA Cup]] (2013-2016), [[Coppa Italia]] (2013-2015), and the [[Coupe de la Ligue]].

From 2016, this channel also broadcast not only football but other sporting events, such as : Tennis, Motor-racing, Handball, and many more.

'''beIN Sports 2 HD''' will also feature live football, but will have another sports remit.

'''beIN Sports 3 HD''' same as the beIN Sports 2 HD. This channel has been launched since August 2016, replacing the Premier League channel.

==== Former channel ====
'''Premier League HD''' will be a 24-hour Premier League-dedicated channel in Indonesia broadcasting nearly 1,600 hours of live programming from 2013-14 to 2015-16 season. This includes all 380 Premier League matches per season, weekly magazine show Premier League World, as well as pre-match coverage and post-game analysis in addition to weekly preview and review shows and highlights in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/asia/12761-beIN-sport-debuts-with-three-channels-in-indonesia beIN Sport debuts with three channels in Indonesia] ''Inside World Football'' 2013-06-21. Retrieved 4 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Despite most of its North American broadcast rights contracts covering both the United States and Canada, beIN Sports initially was not authorized to broadcast in the country nor had it sub-licensed any of its programmings to local broadcasters. The channel had a difficult time finding a broadcaster willing to partner up with it to launch its services. In October 2013, beIN Sports launched an online streaming service in Canada through their website [http://www.beINsportsplay.ca www.beINsportsplay.ca]. The live service was available at no charge for registered users until 1 February 2014; since then, users can access the streams for CAD$19.99 per month. On-demand coverage is not available through beIN Sports Play Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beINsportsplay.ca|title=beIN SPORTS US Connect|work=beinsportsplay.ca|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2013, beIN Sports announced they had reached a deal with Ethnic Channels Group, a local ethnic broadcaster, to launch their services in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=beIN Sport partners with Ethnic Channels Group for distribution in Canada|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1282211/beIN-sport-partners-with-ethnic-channels-group-for-distribution-in-canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The channel was officially launched on 31 January 2014 via [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]] and [[NEXTV]].

beIN Sports HD is available on Shaw Cable on channel 234,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnicchannels.com/shaw-cable-and-shaw-bluesky-add-bein-sports-added-to-channel-line-shaw-cable-channel-line-up/|title=Shaw Cable and Shaw BlueSky add beIN SPORTS  added to Channel Line Shaw Cable channel line-up  Ethnic Channels Group|website=www.ethnicchannels.com|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers Cable on channel 391,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/beINSPORTSUSA/status/441697088968351745|title=beIN SPORTS USA on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Bell Satellite &amp; Fibe on channel 1412,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/beINSPORTSUSA/status/441655428657971200|title=beIN SPORTS USA on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Videotron]] on channel 797 and through OTT broadcaster [[DAZN]].

==Controversies==
beIN Sports' market positions in some regions have led to concerns over the network's dominance. In 2016, French authorities blocked a deal by beIN Sports France to sub-license its sports properties to [[Canal+ Sport (France)|Canal+ Sport]], as it would have given the partnership control of 80% of French sports media rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/french-anti-trust-authorities-set-to-reject-canal-plus-bein-sports-rights-partnership-1201769696/|title=French Anti-Trust Authorities Reject Canal Plus-beIN Sports Rights Partnership|last=Jaafar|first=Ali|date=2016-06-09|newspaper=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/global/canal-plus-bein-sports-deal-struck-down-1201792091/|title=Canal Plus Deal with BeIN Sports Struck Down by French Anti-Trust Board|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|date=2016-06-09|work=Variety|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2017 World Men's Handball Championship]], whose international media rights were owned by beIN Sports, French radio stations declined to air the tournament as beIN Sports wanted them to pay administrative fees about five times higher than the real technical cost, in violation of French law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aipsmedia.com/2017/01/11/20129/handball-aips-radio-media-rights-petition-to-the-eu|title=Unacceptable: Majority of radios denied LIVE coverage of 2017 World Handball Championships in France|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]] were also left without domestic television coverage in four MENA region countries participating in the tournament — Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia — due to exorbitant sublicensing fees being demanded from free-to-air broadcasters by beIN as the region's rightsholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aipsmedia.com/2017/01/13/20141/2017-africa-cup-nation-football-gabon-tv|title=No Africa Cup of Nations for Maghreb-based TV stations|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Premier League]] restricted beIN Sports in the MENA region to airing one match per-week with a 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. UK time kickoff on television only. As these matches [[Blackout (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|may not be broadcast within the United Kingdom due to domestic rights restrictions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/real-madrid-vs-barcelona-why-will-the-first-15-minutes-of-el-clasico-not-be-shown-on-british-tv-9813800.html|title=Real Madrid vs Barcelona: Why will the first 15 minutes of El Clasico not be shown on British TV?|date=2014-10-23|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=19817.html|title=Blocked broadcasting hours defined|date=2016-06-25|work=UEFA.com|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Premier League showed concerns that beIN was not taking adequate steps to prevent its streaming broadcasts from being used for unauthorized retransmissions, especially into the United Kingdom. In November 2014, the Premier League reinstated beIN's full access to 3 p.m. fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportcal.com/News/FeaturedNews/9816|title=BeIN Sports to resume full English Premier League broadcasts after league lifts restrictions |website=Sportcal|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=EPL fans let down by beIN Sports coverage as piracy woes continue|url=http://sport360.com/article/football/24945/epl-fans-let-down-bein-sports-coverage-piracy-woes-continue/|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dr James Hay as Bear Leader, 1704-1729.png|thumb|right|A caricature of a bear-leader]]
A '''bear-leader''' was formerly a man who led [[bear]]s about the country. In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Tudor period]], these animals were chiefly used in the [[blood sport]] of [[bear-baiting]] and were led from village to village. Performing bears were also common; their keepers were generally [[French people|Frenchmen]] or [[Italian people|Italians]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bear-Leader|volume=3|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the phrase "bear-leader" came colloquially to mean a [[tutor]] or [[Legal guardian|guardian]], who escorted any young man of rank or wealth on his travels.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In sport, a '''debenture''' is defined as a certificate of agreement of loans which is given under the company's stamp and carries an undertaking that the debenture holder will get a fixed return (fixed on the basis of [[interest rate]]s) and the principal amount whenever the debenture matures. The terms may also include ancillary benefits such as an option to buy tickets at a favourable price, as well as or instead of interest.  The term stems from the financial concept of a [[debenture]].

A large number of sporting organisations have issued debentures to raise money, to allow their fans to gain a financial stake in the club, to foster a sense of community, and in some cases to fund new construction.

== Royal Albert Hall ==

An early example of debenture holders having rights to seats at venues was the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where about 1,200 of the hall's 5,500 seats were provided on 999-year leases when it opened in 1871 to help finance its construction costs, allowing access to most of its music, sporting and other events, subject to an annual service charge.  The debentures can be passed on or sold, and the tickets to individual events can be resold if the debenture holder does not wish to attend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1023841/For-sale-The-Albert-Hall-box-1-2m-view.html For sale: The Albert Hall box with a £1.2m view] Daily Mail, 3 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tennis ==

The organisers of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Tennis Championships]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|The All England Club]], issue their debenture holders a ticket for each day of the tournament. Furthermore, only debenture holders are permitted to sell their tickets to third parties, either privately or through vendors such as WimbledonDebentureHolders.com.

== Rugby ==

A [[rugby football|rugby]] debenture is somewhat different as, in the most part, no money in the form of [[interest]] is returned to the [[lender]] but the rights to obtain tickets for a seat in that ground. The exact terms of the debentures vary from [[issue (legal)|issue]] to issue but will be covered in the main here. [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] also used this financial method to aid their move back to [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]].

=== Welsh Rugby Union ===

These debentures carry no interest on the amount invested and the advantage of holding said debenture is the right to obtain tickets at the [[Millennium Stadium]], the home of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] where [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] play in the [[Six Nations Championship]].

The serial numbers on the debentures denominate the expiry date (although some are renewable and / or renewed earlier), starting with:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Certificate starts with:

|-
| 05

The WRU has changed some of the numbers during the term of the debenture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debentureshop.com |title=Rugby Debenture shop and other debentures bought and sold |publisher=Debentureshop.com |date= |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rugby Football Union ===

These are issued by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] and permit the holder to 10 years rights to the [[ticket (admission)|ticket]] issue; they are transferable and the principal sum invested is returned 75 years from date of issue.

An [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] debenture confers on the debenture holder the right to purchase, at face value, one ticket for Rugby Union events at [[Twickenham Stadium]] for a given period, currently 10 years (with the exception of a small number of business debentures in the South Stand which confer ticket rights for 15 years). A debenture is fully repayable, currently after 75 years, but bears no interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfu.com/Tickets/Debentures Twickenham Debentures]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is the current debenture issue:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Date of issue

|-

== Other sports organisations ==

Other sports organisations which issue debentures in a similar fashion include:

* [[Arsenal Football Club]]
* [[Donington Park]]
* [[Hampden Park]]&lt;ref name = "tickets"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hibs and Hearts handed 20,000 ticket allocations for Hampden |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/hearts/304217-hibs-and-hearts-handed-20000-allocations-for-hampden/ |work=STV |publisher=STV Group |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 | archiveurl= | archivedate= | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club]]
* [[Twickenham Stadium]]
* [[Wembley Stadium]]

Not all sporting debentures provide an entitlement to free tickets. Some organisations, such as the Millennium Stadium, merely give holders the right to purchase a ticket for events.

Sometimes the terms 'dynamic' and 'static' are used.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the [[diastole|diastolic]] blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow.

Physical exercise is important for maintaining [[physical fitness]] and can contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating digestive health, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system. Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gremeaux|first1=V|last2=Gayda|first2=M|last3=Lepers|first3=R|last4=Sosner|first4=P|last5=Juneau|first5=M|last6=Nigam|first6=A|title=Exercise and longevity.|journal=Maturitas|date=December 2012|volume=73|issue=4|pages=312–7|pmid=23063021|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are not physically active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Physical Activity and Health|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZZPc1FmL7QC&amp;pg=PA3|journal=United States Department of Health|isbn=9781428927940|author1=Department Of Health And Human Services|first1=United States|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Wilund|first2=Kenneth R.|last3=Martin|first3=Stephen A.|last4=Kistler|first4=Brandon M.|date=29 October 2011|title=Exercise, Inflammation and Aging|journal=[[Aging and Disease]]|volume=3|issue=1|pages=130–140|pmc=3320801|pmid=22500274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the benefits from exercise are achieved with around 3500 [[metabolic equivalent]] (MET) minutes per week.&lt;ref name=BMJ2016/&gt; For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, and walking or bicycling for transportation 25 minutes on a daily basis would ''together'' achieve about 3000 MET minutes a week.&lt;ref name=BMJ2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyu|first1=Hmwe H|last2=Bachman|first2=Victoria F|last3=Alexander|first3=Lily T|last4=Mumford|first4=John Everett|last5=Afshin|first5=Ashkan|last6=Estep|first6=Kara|last7=Veerman|first7=J Lennert|last8=Delwiche|first8=Kristen|last9=Iannarone|first9=Marissa L|last10=Moyer|first10=Madeline L|last11=Cercy|first11=Kelly|last12=Vos|first12=Theo|last13=Murray|first13=Christopher J L|last14=Forouzanfar|first14=Mohammad H|title=Physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke events: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=BMJ|date=9 August 2016|pages=i3857|doi=10.1136/bmj.i3857|pmid=27510511|pmc=4979358|volume=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of physical activity causes approximately 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer and 10% of colon cancer worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=I-Min|last2=Shiroma|first2=Eric J|last3=Lobelo|first3=Felipe|last4=Puska|first4=Pekka|last5=Blair|first5=Steven N|last6=Katzmarzyk|first6=Peter T|date=21 July 2012|title=Impact of Physical Inactivity on the World’s Major Non-Communicable Diseases|journal=Lancet|volume=380|issue=9838|pages=219–229|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61031-9|pmc=3645500|pmid=22818936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Early motor skills and development have also shown to be related to physical activity and performance later in life. Children who have more proficient motor skills early on are more inclined to being physically active, and thus tend to perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor proficiency has a positive correlation to childhood physical activity and fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a tendency to partake in a more sedentary lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0742 |pmid=17142498 |title=The Relationship Between Motor Proficiency and Physical Activity in Children |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=e1758 |year=2006 |last1=Wrotniak |first1=B.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
{{Main|Cardiovascular fitness}}
The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well documented. There is a direct correlation between physical inactivity and cardiovascular mortality, and physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Low levels of physical exercise increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mortality.&lt;ref name="aha2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp#.Wu3boogvxnJ|title=American Heart Association Recommendations for Physical Activity in Adults|publisher=American Heart Association|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who participate in physical exercise experience greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lumeng | first1 = Julie C | year = 2006 | title = Small-group physical education classes result in important health benefits | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 148 | issue = 3| pages = 418–419 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.02.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular physical exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahaneku|first=Joseph E.|last2=Nwosu|first2=Cosmas M.|last3=Ahaneku|first3=Gladys I.|date=2000|title=Academic Stress and Cardiovascular Health|journal=Academic Medicine|doi=10.1097/00001888-200006000-00002|volume=75|issue=6|pages=567–568}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dose-response relation between the amount of exercise performed from approximately {{nowrap|700–2000}}&amp;nbsp;[[kcal]] of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly populations. The greatest potential for reduced mortality is in the sedentary who become moderately active. Studies have shown that since heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, regular exercise in aging women leads to healthier cardiovascular profiles. Most beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through moderate-intensity activity (40–60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on age). Persons who modify their behavior after myocardial infarction to include regular exercise have improved rates of survival. Persons who remain sedentary have the highest risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.94.4.857 |pmid=8772712 |title=Statement on Exercise: Benefits and Recommendations for Physical Activity Programs for All Americans: A Statement for Health Professionals by the Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=857–62 |year=1996 |last1=Fletcher |first1=G.

S |last9=Froelicher |first9=V. F |last10=Pina |first10=I. L |last11=Pollock |first11=M. L }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Heart Association, exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

=== Immune system ===
Although there have been hundreds of studies on physical exercise and the [[immune system]], there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness.&lt;ref name="Gleeson2007" /&gt; [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human [[immune system]]; an effect which is modeled in a [[J curve]]. Moderate exercise has been associated with a 29% decreased incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence.&lt;ref name="Gleeson2007" /&gt; However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections. Studies have shown that strenuous stress for long durations, such as training for a marathon, can suppress the immune system by decreasing the concentration of lymphocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=C. C.|last2=Kapasi|first2=Z. F.|date=2002|title=The effect of exercise on the immune system|journal=Rehabilitation Oncology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immune systems of athletes and nonathletes are generally similar. Athletes may have slightly elevated [[natural killer cell]] count and cytolytic action, but these are unlikely to be clinically significant.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gleeson M | title = Immune function in sport and exercise | journal = J. Appl. Physiol. | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 693–9 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17303714 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00008.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin C supplementation has been associated with lower incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s in marathon runners.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007/&gt;

[[Biomarker]]s of [[inflammation]] such as [[C-reactive protein]], which are associated with chronic diseases, are reduced in active individuals relative to sedentary individuals, and the positive effects of exercise may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In individuals with heart disease, exercise interventions lower blood levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, an important cardiovascular risk marker.&lt;ref name=Swardfager2012&gt;{{cite journal | author = Swardfager W | title = Exercise intervention and inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis. | journal = Am. Heart J. | volume = 163 | issue = 4 | pages = 666–76 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22520533 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2011.12.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression in the immune system following acute bouts of exercise may be one of the mechanisms for this anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007/&gt;

=== Cancer ===

A systematic review evaluated 45 studies that examined the relationship between physical activity and cancer survival rates. According to the review, "[there] was consistent evidence from 27 observational studies that physical activity is associated with reduced all-cause, breast cancer–specific, and colon cancer–specific mortality. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the association between physical activity and mortality for survivors of other cancers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ballard-Barbash R, Friedenreich CM, Courneya KS, Siddiqi SM, McTiernan A, Alfano CM | year = 2012 | title = Physical Activity, Biomarkers, and Disease Outcomes in Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review | journal = JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 104 | issue = 11| pages = 815–840 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djs207 | pmid=22570317 | pmc=3465697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is only limited scientific evidence on the subject, people with [[cancer cachexia]] are encouraged to engage in physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid26401466"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults: Executive summary of a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–11 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26401466 | pmc = 4575551 | doi = 10.1002/jcsm.12055 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to various factors, some individuals with cancer cachexia have a limited capacity for physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid29891116"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadeghi M, Keshavarz-Fathi M, Baracos V, Arends J, Mahmoudi M, Rezaei N | title = Cancer cachexia: Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment | journal = Crit.

=== Excessive exercise ===
Too much exercise can be harmful. Without proper rest, the chance of [[stroke]] or other [[Circulatory system|circulation]] problems increases,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. 1998. Cutting weight, losing life. ''News &amp; Observer, February'' 8: 1998, A.1. Retrieved 5 October 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; and muscle tissue may develop slowly. Extremely intense, long-term cardiovascular exercise, as can be seen in athletes who train for multiple marathons, has been associated with scarring of the heart and heart rhythm abnormalities.&lt;ref name="pmid18426850"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möhlenkamp S, Lehmann N, Breuckmann F, Bröcker-Preuss M, Nassenstein K, Halle M, Budde T, Mann K, Barkhausen J, Heusch G, Jöckel KH, Erbel R | title = Running: the risk of coronary events : Prevalence and prognostic relevance of coronary atherosclerosis in marathon runners | journal = Eur.

These changes further result in myocardial cell damage in the lining of the heart, leading to scar tissue and thickened walls.

Inappropriate exercise can do more harm than good, with the definition of “inappropriate” varying according to the individual. For many activities, especially [[running]] and [[cycling]], there are significant injuries that occur with poorly regimented exercise schedules. Injuries from accidents also remain a major concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aertsens J, de Geus B, Vandenbulcke G, Degraeuwe B, Broekx S, De Nocker L, Liekens I, Mayeres I, Meeusen R, Thomas I, Torfs R, Willems H, Int Panis L | title = Commuting by bike in Belgium, the costs of minor accidents | journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 2149–2157 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20728675 | doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2010.07.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the effects of increased exposure to air pollution seem only a minor concern.&lt;ref name="Int Panis"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Int Panis | first = L | title = Exposure to particulate matter in traffic: A comparison of cyclists and car passengers | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 44 | issue = 19 | pages = 2263–2270 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.04.028 | last2 = De Geus | first2 = Bas | last3 = Vandenbulcke | first3 = GréGory | last4 = Willems | first4 = Hanny | last5 = Degraeuwe | first5 = Bart | last6 = Bleux | first6 = Nico | last7 = Mishra | first7 = Vinit | last8 = Thomas | first8 = Isabelle | last9 = Meeusen | first9 = Romain | bibcode = 2010AtmEn..44.2263I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobs L, Nawrot TS, de Geus B, Meeusen R, Degraeuwe B, Bernard A, Sughis M, Nemery B, Panis LI | title = Subclinical responses in healthy cyclists briefly exposed to traffic-related air pollution | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 9 | issue = 64 | pages = 64 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20973949 | pmc = 2984475 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-9-64 | url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9/1/64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In extreme instances, over-exercising induces serious performance loss. Unaccustomed overexertion of muscles leads to [[rhabdomyolysis]] (damage to muscle) most often seen in new army recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jimenez C. |author2=Pacheco E. |author3=Moreno A. |author4=Carpenter A. | year = 1996 | title = A Soldier's Neck and Shoulder Pain | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 81–82 | doi=10.3810/psm.1996.06.1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another danger is [[overtraining]], in which the intensity or volume of training exceeds the body's capacity to recover between bouts. One result of detrimental overtraining is suppressed immune function, with an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). An increased incidence of URTIs is also associated with high volume/intensity training, as well as with excessive exercise (EE), such as in a marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Overtraining, excessive exercise, and altered immunity, 2003.|last = Smith L.L.|date = 2003|journal = Sports Medicine| volume = 33| issue = 5| pp= 347–364|doi = 10.2165/00007256-200333050-00002 |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marathon training requires the runner to build their intensity week to week which makes them more susceptible to injury the more they increase their mileage. A study shows that in the last 10–15 years up to 90% of marathon runners have suffered a physical injury from their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fredericson M, Misra AK | year = 2007 | title = Epidemiology and aetiology of marathon running injuries | url = | journal = Sports Med. | volume = 37 | issue = 4–5| pages = 437–439 | doi=10.2165/00007256-200737040-00043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopping excessive exercise suddenly may create a change in mood. Exercise should be controlled by each body's inherent limitations. While one set of joints and muscles may have the tolerance to withstand multiple [[marathons]], another body may be damaged by 20 minutes of light jogging. This must be determined for each individual.

Too much exercise may cause a woman to cease menstruation, a symptom known as [[amenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717390_5|title = The Female Athlete Triad|website = Medscape.com|last = Furia|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of effects==

===Skeletal muscle===
Resistance training and subsequent consumption of a protein-rich meal promotes [[muscle hypertrophy]] and gains in [[muscle strength]] by stimulating [[myofibrillar]] muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and inhibiting muscle protein breakdown (MPB).&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muscle hypertrophy review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = A brief review of critical processes in exercise-induced muscular hypertrophy | journal = Sports Med. | volume = 44 Suppl 1 | pages = S71–S77 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24791918 | pmc = 4008813 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-014-0152-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulation of muscle protein synthesis by resistance training occurs via [[phosphorylation]] of the [[mechanistic target of rapamycin]] (mTOR) and subsequent activation of [[mTORC1]], which leads to [[protein biosynthesis]] in cellular [[ribosome]]s via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (the [[p70S6 kinase]] and the [[protein translation|translation]] repressor protein [[4EBP1]]).&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Molecular Aspects of Medicine 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brioche T, Pagano AF, Py G, Chopard A | title = Muscle wasting and aging: Experimental models, fatty infiltrations, and prevention | journal = Molecular Aspects of Medicine | volume = 50| pages = 56–87 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27106402 | doi = 10.1016/j.mam.2016.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of muscle protein breakdown following food consumption occurs primarily via increases in [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[insulin]].&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMB in vivo human pharmacodynamics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of HMB-CA in humans in vivo" /&gt; Similarly, increased muscle protein synthesis (via activation of mTORC1) and suppressed muscle protein breakdown (via insulin-independent mechanisms) has also been shown to occur following ingestion of [[β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid]].&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMB in vivo human pharmacodynamics"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = J.

It may seem difficult for one to reconcile that acute provision of CaHMB, in the absence of exogenous nutrition (i.e. EAA's) and following an overnight fast, is still able to elicit a robust, perhaps near maximal stimulation of MPS, i.e. raising the question as to where the additional AA's substrates required for supporting this MPS response are coming from. It would appear that the AA's to support this response are derived from endogenous intracellular/plasma pools and/or protein breakdown (which will increase in fasted periods).&amp;nbsp;... To conclude, a large single oral dose (~3&amp;nbsp;g) of Ca-HMB robustly (near maximally) stimulates skeletal muscle anabolism, in the absence of additional nutrient intake; the anabolic effects of Ca-HMB are equivalent to FA-HMB, despite purported differences in bioavailability (Fig. 4).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Adv.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and multiple anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=BK|title=Muscle as a secretory organ|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|date=July 2013|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1337–62|pmid=23897689|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|isbn=9780470650714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise reduces levels of [[cortisol]], which causes many health problems, both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohen S, Williamson GM | title = Stress and infectious disease in humans | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2006229 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.109.1.5 | last2 = Williamson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endurance exercise before meals lowers blood glucose more than the same exercise after meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borer KT, Wuorinen EC, Lukos JR, Denver JW, Porges SW, Burant CF | title = Two bouts of exercise before meals but not after meals, lower fasting blood glucose | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1606–14 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19568199 | doi = 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31819dfe14 | last2 = Wuorinen | last3 = Lukos | last4 = Denver | last5 = Porges | last6 = Burant }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that vigorous exercise (90–95% of [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]]) induces a greater degree of physiological [[cardiac hypertrophy]] than moderate exercise (40 to 70% of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max), but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wisløff U, Ellingsen Ø, Kemi OJ | title = High=Intensity Interval Training to Maximize Cardiac Benefit of Exercise Taining? | journal = Exercise and Sports Sciences Reviews | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–146 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19550205 | doi = 10.1097/JES.0b013e3181aa65fc | last3 = Kemi | last2 = Ellingsen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training).

===Central nervous system===
{{Further|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Neuroplasticity}}
The effects of physical exercise on the [[central nervous system]] are mediated in part by specific [[neurotrophic factor]] [[myokine|hormones that are released into the blood stream by muscles]], including [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]], [[insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], and [[vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]].&lt;ref name="Exercise - neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BDNF meta analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VEGF aging brain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouchard J, Villeda SA | title = Aging and brain rejuvenation as systemic events | journal = J.

In addition, other growth factors—insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor—have been shown to play an important role in BDNF-induced effects on neuroplasticity [33,172,190,192], as well as exerting neuroprotective effects of their own [33,214,215], thereby contributing to the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comprehensive review - repeat citation"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomez-Pinilla F, Hillman C | title = The influence of exercise on cognitive abilities | journal = Compr.

In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain. Although the action of exercise on brain angiogenesis has been known for many years (10), it is not until recently that neurovascular adaptations in the hippocampus have been associated with cognitive function (29). Exercise enhances the proliferation of brain endothelial cells throughout the brain (113), hippocampal IGF gene expression (47), and serum levels of both IGF (178) and VEGF (63). IGF-1 and VEGF, apparently produced in the periphery, support exercise induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis, as corroborated by blocking the effects of exercise using antibodies against IGF-1 (47) or VEGF (63).| isbn = 9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerebral hemodynamics and AD"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarumi T, Zhang R | title = Cerebral hemodynamics of the aging brain: risk of Alzheimer disease and benefit of aerobic exercise | journal = Front Physiol | volume = 5 | pages = 6 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24478719 | pmc = 3896879 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00006 | quote = Exercise-related improvements in brain function and structure may be conferred by the concurrent adaptations in vascular function and structure. Aerobic exercise increases the peripheral levels of growth factors (e.g., BDNF, IFG-1, and VEGF) which cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and stimulate neurogenesis and angiogenesis (Trejo et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Fabel et al., 2003; Lopez-Lopez et al., 2004). Consistent with this, exercise-related enlargement of hippocampus was accompanied by increases in cerebral blood volume and capillary densities (Pereira et al., 2007). Enhanced cerebral perfusion may not only facilitate the delivery of energy substrates, but also lower the risk of vascular-related brain damages, including WMH and silent infarct (Tseng et al., 2013). Furthermore, regular aerobic exercise is associated with lower levels of Aβ deposition in individuals with APOE4 positive (Head et al., 2012), which may also reduce the risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds (Poels et al., 2010).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise trends ==
[[File:Woman running barefoot on beach.jpg|thumb|[[Running]] has become a popular form of exercise.]]
{{Main|Exercise trends}}
Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work.&lt;ref name=WHO2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ |title=WHO: Obesity and overweight |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218104805/http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor saving technology in the home, and fewer active [[recreational pursuits]].&lt;ref name=WHO2009/&gt; [[Exercise trends#Solutions to address the lack of exercise|Personal lifestyle changes]] however can correct the lack of physical exercise.

Research in 2015 indicates integrating [[mindfulness]] to physical exercise interventions increases exercise adherence, self-efficacy and also has positive effects both psychologically and physiologically.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy AB, Resnick PB |

===Social and cultural variation===
Exercising looks different in every country, as do the motivations behind exercising.&lt;ref name="Fitness for Foreigners"/&gt; In some countries, people exercise primarily indoors, and in others, people primarily [[Outdoor fitness|exercise outdoors]]. People may exercise for personal enjoyment, health and well-being, social interactions, competition or training, etc. These differences could potentially be attributed to geographic location, social tendencies, or otherwise.

In Colombia, citizens value and celebrate the outdoor environments of their country. In many instances, they utilize outdoor activities as social gatherings to enjoy nature and their communities. In Bogotá, Colombia, a 70-mile stretch of road known as the Ciclovía is shut down each Sunday for bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders and other exercisers to work out and enjoy their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Javier|title=Car-Free Streets, a Colombian Export, Inspire Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24streets.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Ciclov%C3%ADa&amp;st=cse|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Colombia, citizens of Cambodia tend to exercise socially outside. In this country, public gyms have become quite popular. People will congregate at these outdoor gyms not only to utilize the public facilities, but also to organize aerobics and dance sessions, which are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Nicky|title=Gyms|url=https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/cambodia/phnom_penh_and_surrounds/phnom_penh/phnom_penh/2235|website=Travel Fish|publisher=Travel Fish|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has also begun developing outdoor gyms, called ''utegym''. These gyms are free to the public and are often placed in beautiful, picturesque environments. People will swim in rivers, use boats, and run through forests to stay healthy and enjoy the natural world around them. This is especially possible in Sweden due to its geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatlow|first1=Anita|title=When in Sweden...making the most of the great outdoors!|url=http://www.stockholmonashoestring.com/when-in-sweden-making-the-most-of-the-great-outdoors/|website=Stockholm on a Shoestring|publisher=Stockholm on a Shoestring|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese exercise, particularly in the retired community, seems to be socially grounded. In the mornings, dances are held in public parks; these gatherings may include Latin dancing, ballroom dancing, tango, or even the jitterbug. Dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact, allowing for both health benefits and social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langfitt|first1=Frank|title=Beijing's Other Games: Dancing In The Park|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93503524|website=National Public Radio|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sociocultural variations in physical exercise show how people in different geographic locations and social climates have varying motivations and methods of exercising. Physical exercise can improve health and well-being, as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty.&lt;ref name="Fitness for Foreigners"/&gt;

== Nutrition and recovery ==
Proper [[nutrition]] is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of [[Macronutrient (nutrition)|macronutrients]] while providing ample [[micronutrient]]s, in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kimber N. |author2=Heigenhauser G. |author3=Spriet L. |author4=Dyck D. | year = 2003 | title = Skeletal muscle fat and carbohydrate metabolism during recovery from glycogen-depleting exercise in humans | journal = American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine | volume = 548 | issue = 3| pages = 919–927 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2002.031179|pmc=2342904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active recovery is recommended after participating in physical exercise because it removes [[lactic acid|lactate]] from the blood more quickly than inactive recovery. Removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature, which can also benefit the immune system, as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid16195010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reilly T, Ekblom B | title = The use of recovery methods post-exercise | journal = J.

== History ==
{{See also|Aerobic exercise#History|Fitness culture}}
The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was [[Cicero|Marcus Cicero]], Roman politician and lawyer, who stated: "It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspirational-quotes-and-quotations.com/quotes-about-exercise.html |title=Quotes About Exercise Top 10 List }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise was also seen to be valued later in history during the [[Early Middle Ages]] as a means of survival by the [[Germanic peoples]] of Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/history.html|title=History of Fitness|website=www.unm.edu|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century. After 1860, Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford and instituted a training regimen for 12 military officials at the university. This regimen was later assimilated into the training of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physical-culture#toc249304|title=physical culture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well. The first and most significant of these in the UK was the Women's League of Health and Beauty, founded in 1930 by [[Mary Bagot Stack]], that had 166,000 members in 1937.&lt;ref name=FitnessLeague&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fitness League History |url=http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |website=The Fitness League |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729135514/http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |archivedate=29 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was further established in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by [[Jerry Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The man who invented exercise|newspaper=Financial Times|date=11 September 2009|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e6ff90ea-9da2-11de-9f4a-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris1953"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris JN, Heady JA, Raffle PA, Roberts CG, Parks JW | title = Coronary heart-disease and physical activity of work | journal = Lancet | volume = 265 | issue = 6795 | pages = 1053–7 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13110049 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(53)90665-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease.&lt;ref name="Morris1953"/&gt;

The '''final''' of a [[Competition#Sports|competition]] is the match or round in which the winner of the entire event is decided.

In [[sport]]s competitions following a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] system, where only two individuals or teams compete in each match, the final is usually played between the winners of two [[semi-final]]s. However, if more than two entrants are required for each match, then qualification for the final may be through some other process such as winning ''heats''.

The final is usually, but not always, the last match in a tournament to be played, and the winner of this match is declared the winner of the whole tournament. In many contests, the winner(s) and runner(s)-up receive [[Gold medal|gold]] and [[Silver medal|silver]] medals respectively. Another game, or competition, between the two players who lost in the semi-finals is done to determine who receives the [[bronze medal]]. Unusually, many teams (32 in recent years) qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals. These teams then play each other in various formats until the ultimate two 'finalists' play off for the gold and silver medals.

If the final round is contested in a "best-of" format (like "best-of-7"), the term is sometimes called "finals," ([[playoffs]]) to denote that there is more than one game (like "the [[NBA Finals]]")  The [[Stanley Cup]] Final has been referred to in the singular since the 2005-06 season.  However, it refers to its semi-final round as the Conference Finals, because there are two separate ones being contested.

{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}
In American sports, the '''final four''' is the last four teams remaining in a [[playoff]] [[tournament]]. Usually the final four compete in the two games of a [[single-elimination]] tournament's [[semi-final]] (penultimate) round.  Of these teams, the two who win in the semi-final round play another single-elimination game whose winner is the tournament champion. In some tournaments, the two teams that lose in the semi-final round compete for third place in a [[consolation game]].

The term "final four" is most often used in the United States and in sports heavily influenced by that country; elsewhere, only the term "semi-finals" is in common use. "Final four" first appeared in print in a 1975 article for the ''Official Collegiate Basketball Guide'', whose author Ed Chay was a sportswriter for the ''[[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland Plain Dealer]]''. Chay stated that the [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]] basketball team "was one of the final four" during [[1974 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|the previous season's tournament]]. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) pioneered the term and later trademarked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koerner|first=Brendan|title=Why Is It Called "March Madness"?|url=http://iscroll-primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2004/03/why_is_it_called_march_madness.html|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|website=Slate.com|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lubinger|first=Bill|title=Interested in making some profit from the Final Four? That's just March Madness (for your lawyers)|url=http://www.cleveland.com/marchmadness/index.ssf/2011/03/interested_in_making_some_prof.html|publisher=''[[The Plain Dealer]]''|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2016|quote=Was a mere passing reference by Ed Chay, the late Plain Dealer sportswriter, in a story he wrote on page 5 of the 1975 Official Collegiate Basketball Guide. 'Outspoken Al McGuire of Marquette, whose team was one of the final four in Greensboro, was among several coaches who said it was good for college basketball that UCLA was finally beaten,' Chay wrote. 'Final Four' was first capitalized in the NCAA's 1978 basketball guide.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and most common use of the term is in reference to the final four teams in the annual [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. Each Final Four team is the regional champion from the East, South, Midwest, or West regions of the tournament. (Other region names have been used, such as "Mideast" replacing South, or "Southeast" and "Southwest" replacing South and Midwest.) The teams travel from the four separate sites of their regional rounds to a common venue for the Final Four. In the men's basketball tournament, a team must win either four or five consecutive rounds (games) to qualify for the Final Four. The four teams are matched against each other on the last Saturday of the tournament.  The two winners emerge to play in the national championship game two nights later, traditionally on Monday evening. The same concept is used for the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament]] (which has a Friday/Sunday semifinal/final scheduling to not conflict with the men's tourney). Because most teams in the men's, and all teams in the women's tournament begin play from a field of 64, each  team must win four games to qualify for the Final Four.

The NCAA also uses "Final Four" for other sports besides basketball, such as the [[NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship|Men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|Women's Volleyball Championship]]. For [[College ice hockey|ice hockey]] tournaments, the NCAA uses a variation of the term: the "[[Frozen Four]]".

Because the term is now a [[registered trademark]] of the NCAA in the U.S., no other organizations in that country can use the phrase to refer to their tournaments. Organizations in other countries may officially do so. Many basketball organizations outside the U.S. use the term for the semifinal and final rounds of their tournaments such as the [[FIBA Americas League]] ([[FIBA Americas League Final 4]]), the [[EuroLeague]] ([[EuroLeague Final Four]]), the [[Basketball Champions League|Champions League]] ([[Basketball Champions League Final Four|Champions League Final Four]]), the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League|Israeli Premier League]], and the [[UAAP Final Four|University Athletic Association of the Philippines]]. The [[CEV Champions League]] in volleyball also uses "Final Four" for its final rounds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53972">The 1992 match between former World Chess Champions [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] was billed as a [[World Chess Championship]], but was unofficial.  It was a rematch of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship]] match. The match started in [[Sveti Stefan]] near [[Budva]], an island off the coast of [[Montenegro]]. The match rules required a player to win ten games (draws not counting), with no {{chessgloss|adjournment|adjournments}}. After a player had won five games, the match would take a 10-day recess and continue in [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]].  Both places were at the time part of the same country, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was under heavy UN economic sanctions because of the country′s involvement in the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|wars]] in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Fischer won the match 10–5.

==Background==
After defeating Spassky to win the title of World Champion in the [[World Chess Championship 1972]], Fischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against the winner of the [[World Chess Championship 1975#1974 Candidates tournament|1974 FIDE Candidates Tournament]], [[Anatoly Karpov]]. Fischer, however, was unhappy with the format of the World Championship. At the time the format was a 24-game match, with the winner being the first player to score 12½ points; if the match was drawn 12–12, then the match would be stopped, the prize money split, and the Champion retained his title. Fischer disliked this format because the player who was leading could play to draw games instead of win, and with each drawn game coast closer to the title. In his match against Spassky in 1972, games 14 to 20 were all draws. This style of chess offended Fischer. Instead, Fischer demanded the format be changed to that used in the very [[World Chess Championship 1886|first World Championship]], between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]], where the winner was the first player to score 10 wins with draws not counting. In case of a 9–9 score, the champion would retain title, and the prize fund split equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Brilliancies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasparov |first=Garry |date= |title=My Great Predecessors, Volume IV |url= |location= |publisher=Gloucester Publishers |page= |isbn=1-85744-395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the [[Nice, France|Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]]. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected the 9–9 clause as well as the possibility of an unlimited match.&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, pp. 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fischer refused to defend his title, and Karpov was declared World Champion by forfeit.

Seventeen years later, Fischer entered negotiations with sponsors willing to fund a match under his proposed format, settling on a bid from Yugoslav millionaire [[Jezdimir Vasiljević]]. Fischer insisted that since he had not been defeated in a match, he was still the true World Champion. He further claimed that all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov and his challengers [[Viktor Korchnoi|Korchnoi]] and [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], had prearranged outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weeks|first=Mark |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/92fs$$.htm |title=1992 Fischer – Spassky Rematch Highlights |publisher=Printer |date=1997–2008 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played a rematch of the 1972 World Chess Championship against Spassky (tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list at the time).

==Aftermath==
After Fischer's victory, he proclaimed himself as the "Undefeated Champion of the World". His status as a World Champion in 1992 is not widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{Citation |last=Burgess |first=Graham |authorlink=Graham Burgess |title=The Mammoth Book of Chess |year=2010 |edition= |publisher=Running Press |id= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the FIDE world champion was [[Garry Kasparov]]. Kasparov was also world number one in the current (July 1992) rating list with a 2790 rating, a 70-point lead over second ranked [[Vassily Ivanchuk]]. Fischer's score of 17½ out of 30 (counting draws) against Spassky, rated 2545 at the time, gave him a performance rating of 2645,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/calculator_rp.phtml FIDE Chess Rating Calculator] using Rc=2545, W=17.5, N=30. Accessed 31-Aug-2017&lt;/ref&gt; which would have put him at No. 12 in the world on the July 1992 list. [[Yasser Seirawan]] believed that the match proved that Fischer's playing strength was "somewhere in the top ten in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Seirawan &amp; Stefanovic 1992, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov himself was dismissive of Fischer, stating that "Bobby is playing OK, nothing more. Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waitzkin |first=Fred |authorlink=Fred Waitzkin |title=Mortal Games: The Turbulent Genius of Garry Kasparov |year=1993 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-13827-7 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer never played competitively again after this match, and died in 2008.

As for Spassky, this match proved to be his last major challenge. He continued to play occasional events, but never participated in a world championship cycle again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1206">'''Grinding''' is a sliding stunt performed in many [[extreme sports]]. Stances in which slides are performed are known as '''grinds'''.

Grinding is performed by sliding across the top of an obstacle, and can be accomplished in a number of ways. A range of equipment can be used to grind an object or obstacle and each sport lends the performer different options of obstacles and subsequent grind positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">The '''Indian dribble''' is a [[field hockey]] technique, first appearing at the [[Field hockey at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]]. It consists of pushing the ball rapidly from right to left and then from left to right repeatedly by turning the hockey stick. Once mastered, it is a very good way to beat your opponent, as a player using Indian dribble is hard to defend against. It was named after the superb dribbling skills of the Indian and Pakistani teams.

==History==
It was introduced by the [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian]] and the [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistani]] teams. This new technique was one of the key points that helped these countries lead the field hockey world at that time. Until the mid-1950s playing the ball on the right hand side was dominant but this changed following a tour by the [[Germany|German]] National team to Pakistan. In 1954 players studied the Pakistan methods for four weeks, analysing their individual skills at controlling the ball in front of the body. As a result, the “Indian Dribble“ and the shorter Asian blade of sticks were introduced to the German game. Due to the changed position of the ball, and with the help of new blades, players’ behaviour was less predictable. They had a greater variety of passing and deception options.

A new skill in 1950s, it is now a basic technique in field hockey.

In the 1980s astro-turf was introduced and it was used for hockey. It was then easier for other nationalities to master the techniques. It is used in many ways when playing hockey matches.

==Remarkable Players==
'''Major Dhyan Chand''', who to some people is the best field hockey player in history, is well remembered and known for his ability at executing the dribbling. Back in the day, his wooden stick was cut in half just to check that there were no magnets or illegal enhancements that were allowing him to play like that.

'''Shahbaz Ahmed''' is one of the best dribblers in history. His skills were so fast that he is still remembered because of that. His generation was able to achieve many victories for Pakistan.

'''Luciana Aymar''', probably the best female player in history. She was selected 8 times as the FIH Player of the Year. She was able to execute the basic and most fundamental field hockey skills and tricks at a speed like no other.

==Skill==

A '''jersey''' is an item of [[knit]]ted [[clothing]], traditionally in [[wool]] or [[cotton]], with [[sleeve]]s, worn as a [[Sweater|pullover]], as it does not open at the front, unlike a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]. It is acommonly worn by sports teams as part of the team uniform, in team colors, often with a required number and optionally the player's name on the back. It is usually close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a [[guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] that is more often hand knit with a thicker [[yarn]]. The word is usually used interchangeably with [[sweater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0040517507078023|title=Studies on the Influence of Knit Structure and Stitch Length on Ring and Compact Yarn Single Jersey Fabric Properties|first1=C.D.|last1=Kane|first2=U.J.|last2=Patil|first3=P.|last3=Sudhakar|date=1 August 2007|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=77|issue=8|pages=572–582|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0040517507078023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a jersey as used in [[sport]] is a [[shirt]] worn by a member of a team, typically depicting the [[sportsperson|athlete]]'s name and team number as well as the [[logotype]] of the team or corporate sponsor. [[Cycling jersey]]s of specific color or pattern represent certain statuses in [[cycling]], such as the yellow jersey of the leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France]], or the [[rainbow jersey]] for the world champion.  Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic [[microfiber]] material to aid in wicking sweat away from the skin to allow it to [[evaporate]].  The main garment of an [[ice hockey]] uniform, which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a [[hockey jersey]]. This garment, along with [[basketball]] jerseys which are usually [[sleeveless]] and [[baseball]] jerseys which are usually button up, have become fashion accessories. A related term is "[[Bib (garment)|bib]]", which may refer to a shirt (jersey, esp. in Britain{{citation needed|reason=Lived here all my life, never once heard anyone use bib to mean shirt/jersey|date=February 2018}}). In [[Australian rules football]], the player's shirt is known as a "[[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051755502500314|title=An Engineering Approach to Jersey Fabric Construction|first=W.E.|last=Shinn|date=1 March 1955|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=25|issue=3|pages=270–277|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/004051755502500314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemdvoorhem.nl/|title=Hemdvoorhem.nl - Gratis verzending en 100 dagen gratis retour|website=www.hemdvoorhem.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sports, such as [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and various [[football]] codes, a player's jersey may be "[[retired number#See also|retired]]".  When a jersey is retired that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honor of that player's accomplishment.  Generally, when a jersey is retired, the [[Number (sports)|number]] on the player's jersey is made unavailable for future players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jaCjAgAAQBAJ|title=Textiles in Sport|first=Roshan|last=Shishoo|date=29 August 2005|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Running ==
{{Main|Running}}
[[File:100m women Golden League 2007 in Zurich.jpg|thumb|The finish of a women's 100&amp;nbsp;m race]]
Running is defined in [[sport]]ing terms as a [[gait]] in which at some point all feet are off the ground at the same time. This is in contrast to [[walking]], where one foot is always in contact with the ground. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from [[jogging]] to [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]]. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.  The [[Ancient_Olympic_Games#Origins|origins of the Olympics]] are shrouded in myth, though the first recorded game took place in 776 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkzWTugSj0C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=first+recorded+victor+of+the+stade-race+in+776&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1MYlTNDBDJCNOO3WrPAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20recorded%20victor%20of%20the%20stade-race%20in%20776&amp;f=false |title=The Ancient Olympics - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gaelic Ireland]] the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], which featured footraces, are attested from the 6th century CE; medieval chroniclers gave founding dates as early as 1829 BCE.

{{For|other people named Mike Rossi|Mike Rossi (disambiguation){{!}}Mike Rossi}}

Mike Rossi (born May 1967) is a [[disc jockey]] and former [[Television presenter|television host]] who gained national notoriety in 2015 after qualifying for the [[Boston Marathon]] with a time that later came under heavy scrutiny, resulting in widespread accusations that he had cheated in his qualifying race.

==Early career==
Rossi was one of the dancers on the 1980s television show [[Dancin' On Air]]. In 1986, one of the hosts quit, and 36 hours later, Rossi became one of the co-hosts of the show at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="citypaper" /&gt; The show was canceled in 1987.&lt;ref name="philly1" /&gt;

==Viral fame and cheating accusations==
In 2015, Rossi ran in the Boston Marathon, and brought his wife and 9-year-old twins on the trip from their hometown of [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington, Pennsylvania]]. He subsequently received a form letter from his children's principal informing him that a family vacation was not an excusable reason for absence, and that the school days his children missed would be marked as unexcused. Rossi then wrote a response to the principal, which he never mailed, but did post on [[Facebook]]; the post went viral, and was shared by over 28,700 people within a week.&lt;ref name="NBC10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philly2" /&gt;

After appearances on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] show and [[Fox &amp; Friends]], controversy erupted over how Rossi qualified for the Boston Marathon. Rossi had submitted a qualifying time of 3:11  that he had supposedly run in the Lehigh Valley Health Network Via Marathon. The organizers of that marathon asked USA Track &amp; Field for help in investigating cheating allegations, raised mostly by other runners who, in exploring Rossi's race history, noticed that a 3:11 marathon was inconsistent with all of Rossi’s other publicly available race results.&lt;ref name ="post" /&gt; In addition, there were no photos of Rossi anywhere on the Lehigh marathon race course except for at the finish line, while most other runners were seen in 10 or more pictures taken along the way by a company hired to take photographs of the runners.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; 

The editors of LetsRun.com, one of the top five running-centric websites in the world, called the evidence "overwhelming" that "Rossi did not run the entire 2014 Lehigh Valley Marathon."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt; The organizers of the Via Marathon sent LetsRun a statement explaining why they could not disqualify Rossi's time, stating it was "simply because they received no reports of wrongdoing as the race took place." They also stated that "there is data from Rossi’s participation in other racing events indicating that Rossi’s time may not be accurate."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt;

===Aftermath===
The founders of LetsRun.com publicly offered Rossi $100,000 if he could repeat his 3:11 performance within one year of the offer.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; Meanwhile, the organizers of the Via Marathon announced that they had taken several steps to verify runner participation and timing accuracy after the Rossi incident. Previously, the only timing mats at the Via marathon were at the start and finish line. The marathon committee added four on-course timing mats and video surveillance at several locations that Via would archive.&lt;ref name="mcall" /&gt;

==Arrest at Kenny Chesney concert==
On June 25, 2016, Rossi was [[Tailgate party|tailgating]] prior to a Kenny Chesney concert at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia in Lot K, which had opened up to tailgaters at 10 am. At around 5 pm, when he was asked to "move along" several times by venue security, he refused, and when police arrived on the scene and made the same request, Rossi refused again, and was arrested for criminal trespass.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; At his court appearance two weeks later, a ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine reporter approached Rossi, who told reporters that he was not Mike Rossi. Rossi's identity was immediately confirmed by a court official on the scene.&lt;ref name="philly3" /&gt;

==Arrest at a McGraw/Hill concert==
On August 19, 2017, Rossi was arrested outside the Wells Fargo center after a [[Tim McGraw]]/[[Faith Hill]] concert for allegedly punching a 47-year-old woman. Rossi later posted to his Facebook page admitting he had "a hellish past 2 1/2 years," and "most of it I brought on myself and I take full responsibility."&lt;ref name="philly4" /&gt;

'''Nordic combined''' is a [[winter sport]] in which athletes compete in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[ski jumping]]. [[Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics]] and the [[FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]] are ongoing.

== History ==
The first major competition was held in 1892 in [[Oslo]] at the first [[Holmenkollen ski jump]]. [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V of Norway]] was an able jumper and competed in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival in the 1920s. It was in the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] and has been on the program ever since. Until the 1950s, the cross-country race was held first, followed by the ski jumping. This was reversed as the difference in the cross-country race tended to be too big to overcome in ski jumping. The sport has been dominated by the Norwegians, supported by the Finns. It was not until 1960 that the Nordic grip on this discipline was broken when [[West Germany|West German]] [[Georg Thoma]] won the gold medal at the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=fis&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined Equipment and History|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined-equipment-and-history|publisher=FIS|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided in early-November 2016 that women's competitions were to be established on FIS-level starting during the second half of the 2010s with inclusion at world championships starting in 2021 and at the Olympic Winter Games in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/news-multimedia/news/article=decisions-the-autumn-2016-fis-council-meeting-oberhofen-sui.html|title=Decisions of the Autumn 2016 FIS Council Meeting|publisher=International Ski Federation|language=English|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Olympic debut for women in 2022 was cancelled by IOC in July 2018 who was asking more development time for this discipline and then likely been added in 2026. In May of 2018 the FIS Congress made several decisions regarding the inclusion of women in the sport of Nordic Combined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2018-19/article=fis-congress-historic-milestones-for-ladies-nordic-combined|title=FIS Congress: Historic steps for Nordic Combined Ladies|website=www.fis-ski.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  As of 2019, women will be officially included in FIS Junior World Championships. It was confirmed that 2021 will mark the start of the FIS World Championship program for women (senior level).  2018 marks the second year of the Continental Cup program for women, which will include a total of 12 events.  

== Competition ==

Formats and variations currently used in the World Cup are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/extra/faq.html|title=Nordic Combined World Cup|publisher=FIS|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Individual [[Gundersen method|Gundersen]]: competition starts with one competition jump from a normal or large hill. Later on the same day, the {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race takes place. The winner starts at 00:00:00 and all other athletes start with time disadvantages according to their jumping score. The first to cross the finish line is the winner. A variation of this is the Final Individual Gundersen, consisting of two jumps and {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} of cross-country skiing in free technique.
*  Nordic Combined Triple: introduced in the [[2013–14 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup]], it features three different events on three days and one overall winner who is awarded extra World Cup points and prize money:
** Day 1: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Prologue
** Day 2: 1 jump &amp; {{convert|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Individual Gundersen (Top 50 from Day 1's competition)
** Day 3: 2 jumps &amp; {{convert|20|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} Final Individual Gundersen (Top 30 from Day 2's competition)
* Team Event: introduced in the 1980s, one team consists of four athletes who have one competition jump each. The total score of all four athletes determines the time disadvantages for the start of the ensuing {{convert|5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race. The first team to cross the finish line wins.
* Team Sprint: teams consist of two athletes each. In the ski jumping part, every athlete makes one competition jump like in the Individual Gundersen or Team Event formats and the time behind for the start of the successive cross-country race. The team to arrive first at the finish line wins the competition.

Included in the rules but currently not used in World Cup:
* Penalty Race: instead adding a time disadvantage, distance is added to the cross-country part.
* Mass Start: the only format in which the cross-country part takes place before the ski jumping. All competitors start into a {{convert|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} cross-country race in free technique at the same time. The final cross-country times are then converted into points for the ski jumping part. The winner is determined in a points-based system.

Events in the Olympics are: the sprint K120 individual, ski jumping K90 (70m), and Team/4x5km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Combined|url=http://www.olympic.org/nordic-combined|publisher=IOC|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
* [[Ski bindings]]: secure only the toe of the boot to the ski. In cross-country, it must be placed so that not more than 57% of the entire ski length is used as the front part. In jumping, a cord or aluminum post attaches the heel of the boot to the ski to prevent tips from dropping and/or wobbling of skis during flight.
* [[Ski boot]]
** For jumping, a high-backed, flexible yet firm boots with a low cut at the front, designed to allow the skier to lean forward during flight.
** For cross-country a skating boot is used.
* [[Ski suit]] and [[ski helmet|helmet]]
* [[Skis]]: jumping skis may have a length of a maximum 145% of the total body height of the competitor. Cross-country skis may be up to 2 meters long.
* [[Ski poles]] 
* [[Ski wax]]: glide wax for speed is used in both types, and kick wax is used in cross-country.&lt;ref name=fis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Oropolitics''' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' meaning [[mountain]] and ''politikos'' meaning [[citizen]]. In modern usage it denotes the use and abuse of [[mountaineering]] for political purposes.

==Origin of term==
The term "oropolitics" was coined by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in the early 1980s to describe the surreptitious efforts, first by [[Pakistan]] from the 1950s, and then by [[India]] from the late 1970s, to demonstrate control and ownership of the [[Siachen Glacier]] by allowing or organising mountaineering [[expeditions]] to the high peaks such as [[Saltoro Kangri]] and [[Teram Kangri]] flanking the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%2074-49%20Sircar%20Oropolitics.pdf  Joydeep Sircar, "Oropolitics: A dissertation on the political overtones of mountaineering in the East-Central Karakoram, 1975-82", Alpine Journal (1984), p. 74-79. Reprinted from Himalaya Sameeksha.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siachen War]] of 1984 was the direct outcome of these 'oropolitical' activities. Another example is the [[China|Chinese]] publication ''Raising the Five Star Flag on Mount Tomur'', an account of the successful Chinese expedition of 1977 to the [[Tien Shan]] peak better known by its Russian name as [[Pik Pobedy]] (nowadays renamed yet again by Kyrgyzstan as [[Jengish Chokusu]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151896/peak-pobeda-mnt-tomur.html SummitPost - Pik Pobeda/Tomur Feng - Climbing, Hiking &amp; Mountaineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese volume seems to imply a first ascent and completely ignores multiple Russian ascents.

==Other examples==
The strangest oropolitical events must surely be the unpublicised ascents of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Nanda Kot]] by joint Indo-US expeditions in the 1960s to plant devices to monitor Chinese [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Kohli and K. Conboy, "Spies in the Himalayas", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The media disclosure in 1978 that an Indo-American covert expedition had planted a nuclear-fuelled monitoring device atop Nanda Kot in the 1960s, and that subsequently the device had disappeared, led to fears of radioactive contamination of the river [[Ganges]], and a political [[brouhaha]].

Recent examples of oropolitics, again from India, were the claimed ascent of '''Nyegyi Kangsang''' (7047 m) and the attempt on the nearby peak '''Kangto''' (7090 metres) by Indian teams in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Articles in ''The Himalayan Journal'', 1996, Mumbai.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are remote [[Arunachal Pradesh]] peaks difficult of access, located on or very close to the India-China border. These were as much sporting activities as visible demonstrations of de facto control of India over terrain claimed by China. It has been suggested that the actual summit of Nyegyi Kangsang was not even reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pakpotpourri.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/the-myth-of-siachien-an-extreme-case-of-oro-politics/   Jawad Raza Khan, "The Myth of Siachien :An extreme case of Oro-politics", Pakpotpourri.  On line.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simmering dispute between [[China]] and [[Bhutan]] over [[Kula Kangri]] (7554? metres), which is possibly located wholly in Chinese territory, but is claimed by Bhutan to lie on the Bhutan-China border and be the highest peak of Bhutan, has clear oropolitical overtones. A Japanese team attempting nearby [[Gangkhar Puensum]] (7570? metres) on the Bhutan-China border in 1999 from the Chinese side stopped short of the true peak due to the [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]] having prohibited ascent of the unclimbed main summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html Kangkar Punsum and Kula Kangri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311064618/http://www.sol.co.uk/v/viewfinder/kula.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pepassemblyatschool.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A group of students cheering and clapping at their high school pep assembly.]]
A '''pep rally''' or '''pep assembly''' is a gathering of people, typically students of [[middle school]], [[high school]], and [[university|college]] age, before a [[sports]] event. The purpose of such a gathering is to encourage [[school spirit]] and to support members of the [[team]]. It is generally seen as an [[United States|American]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/daniel-m-cooke/uk-vs-usa-school-pride_b_2696346.html|title=UK vs. USA - School Pride|date=2013-02-19|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a pep rally, cheerleaders lead in boisterous chants and dance moves intended to get the student body excited. Games between competing classes with small prizes may be held. The school's [[School band|band]] often play upbeat music in between demonstrations, and the [[drumline]] may play. The school's choir may sing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" to the crowd. In the case of a [[homecoming]] game, the Homecoming "court" may be chosen and announced.

This is also a time for the team captains to let the school know how their team are doing this season. Most schools have pep rallies to honor future and past events.

[[College basketball]] teams celebrate the opening of the season with [[Midnight Madness (basketball)|Midnight Madness]], an event similar to a pep rally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">A '''scratch team''' is a team, usually in sport, brought together on a temporary basis, composed of players who normally play for different sides. A game played between two scratch teams may be called a '''scratch match'''.

The earliest instance of the term "scratch team" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;ref&gt;"scratch, adj.". OED Online. November 2010. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/173358?rskey=APOmdQ&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false (accessed February 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; is a restaurant guide in 1851 (''London at table'', by an anonymous author, referring to "'a scratch team' of servants"&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=London at table; or, How, when, and where to dine and order a dinner|year=1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dg8HAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The ''OED'' also records the term "scratch match" - defined as an impromptu game played by scratch teams - being used in the same year in Rev. [[James Pycroft]]'s ''The Cricket Field'' - one of the earliest books about cricket - "...that is the time that some sure, judicious batsman, whose eminence is little seen amidst the loose hitting of a scratch match, comes calmly and composedly to the wicket and makes a stand;..."&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The cricket-field. By J. Pycroft|author=Pycroft, J.|year=1862|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMgBAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early and notable use of the term is from 1874, when [[Wanderers F.C.|The Wanderers]], who had just lost an [[FA Cup]] match for the first time, were due to play a match against [[Upton Park F.C.|Upton Park]].&lt;ref name="Wand"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wanderers - Five Times F.A. Cup Winners|author=Cavallini, R.|year=2005|publisher=Dog N Duck|isbn=9780955049606|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmQL_fnLcsQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the contemporary report, "unfortunately the Wanderers failed to put in an appearance. In order, therefore not to disappoint a large number of people who had assembled to witness the play, a scratch team was chosen to represent the missing team."&lt;ref name="Wand"/&gt; The match was lost 11-0, with each of the opposing team scoring a goal.."&lt;ref name="Wand"/&gt;

The term is listed in the 1913 Nelson's Encyclopedia, among slang terms.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nelson's Encyclopaedia: Everybody's Book of Reference ...|author1=Colby, F.M.|author2=Sandeman, G.|year=1913|publisher=Thomas Nelson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAJCAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street workout''' is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It originated in Ancient Greece, but became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the [[United States]], especially in [[New York City]], Baltimore's urban neighborhoods and Myanmar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[calisthenics]], and [[sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CALISTHENICS - Street Workout Academy|url = http://streetworkoutacademy.com/calisthenics/#|website = Street Workout Academy|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks. Street workout teams and organized competitions exist.

== Overview ==
A typical street workout routine often consists of [[physical exercises]] such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats. Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isometric exercises - Street Workouts|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/tag/isometric-exercises/|website = Street Workouts|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

Street workout is divided in two main branches, the first one being strength training and the second dynamics. Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc. Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others. Dynamics includes movements like 360s and its variations, switchblades, and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets.

Some of the main benefits of street workout activities are:

* It promotes healthy living, and a desirable physique can be attained with it;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effect of Calisthenics Exercises at Various Intensity on Girl Students' Figure and Cardiorespiratory Functions--《Journal of Guangzhou Physical Education Institute》2003年06期|url = http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GZTX200306018.htm|website = en.cnki.com.cn|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is a social event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, [[bodyweight exercise|classic exercises]] were modified and combined with elements from other sports. The starting point of the whole was New York. Through the sports parks there, people could do their workout without fitness studios. Sport or workout parks consist mostly of different pull-up bars, bars and hammocks, so that training is mainly with one's own body weight.

Different groups developed their own style by combining classical calisthenics with exercises from gymnastics, break dance, hip hop and freerunning, or to develop new movements themselves. These groups presented videos of the novel form of calisthenics on the internet and thus triggered a regular boom, especially in Eastern Europe.

In 2011 the first World Championship for Calisthenics / Street Workout in Riga was held. The WSWCF is the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation. Since then, a world championship has been held every year.

Among the best-known representatives of the modern calisthenics are the groups Barentaz, Baristi, Barstarzz, Bar-Barians and Street Workout Ukraine, and individuals such as Hannibal for King and Frank Medrano.

==Basics of street workout==
A typical street workout routine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/street-workout-programs/|title = Street Workout Programs|date = |access-date = 2016-01-16|website = Street Workouts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of:
* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] exercising – a system of exercises with various levels of exertion provided for health strengthening, development of strength and stamina, as well as for shaping an athletic constitution. Athletics exercising is used to increase strength level, develop physical shape and for rehabilitation.
* [[Isometric exercise]]s – a type of strength training whereby you hold a static position.
* [[Calisthenics]] (Kalestenos) – is a complex of many simple exercises which are performed using purely body weight. The aim of these exercises is to train muscular strength and to evolve comprehensive fitness.
* [[Calisthenics|Urban calisthenics]] – a form of body weight exercise performed with no or little apparatus. Individuals and/or groups train and exercise in urban areas and spaces. Advanced urban calisthenics skills include muscle ups, typewriter pull-ups and both front and back levers.
Street workouts are usually performed outdoor or in specifically designed street workout parks. A typical street workout park looks like a playground with a soft underground and consists of several bars, poles and other objects used for body weight exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://imgarcade.com/1/street-workout-park/|title = IMG Arcade - Street Workout Parks|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = IMG Arcade|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Street workout Slovenija 3.JPG|thumb|Street workout in [[Slovenia]]]]
In street workout, people often create teams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Submaximal performance testing''' is a way of estimating either VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max or "aerobic fitness" in [[sports medicine]]. The test protocols do not reach the maximum of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Submaximal tests are used because maximal tests can be dangerous in individuals who are not considered normal healthy subjects and for elite athletes maximal tests would disrupt training load balance.&lt;ref name="LSCT"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First submaximal cycle test was developed by [[Per-Olof Åstrand|Åstrand]] and Ryhming in 1954, and is called [[Åstrand test]].&lt;ref name="LSCT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calculatorpro.com/calculator/astrand-test/&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known submaximal cycle test is known as Physical Work Capacity (PWC 170) test.&lt;ref name="LSCT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brianmac.co.uk/pwc170.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first submaximal running test is well-known [[Cooper test]] developed by [[Kenneth H. Cooper]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=aerobics&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cooper |first1= Kenneth H. |authorlink1= Kenneth H.

Some tests are developed targeting especially tests subjects without exercise background, such as [[Rockport Fitness Walk]] and [[UKK walk test]].&lt;ref name="LSCT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://walking.about.com/library/cal/ucrockport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukkinstituutti.fi/en/products/ukk_walk_test&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">In [[team sport]], '''team of the century''' and '''team of the decade''' are hypothetical best teams over a given time period.  For the century team, it can be either 100 years, or for a century (always the 20th).  Similarly the team of the decade can be for 10 years or a decade (for example the 1980s).

Teams of the decade and century are selected for both leagues and clubs and sometimes selected for other reasons, such as to honour the contribution of a particular ethnic group.

Teams of the 20th century in particular have been controversial due to their loose criteria and the [[systemic bias]] toward current players, given that the performance of players before the advent of [[broadcasting]] of matches cannot be reviewed and relies on hearsay and archival records.

The Team of the Century concept used extensively in the sport of [[Australian rules football]], where, since the mid-1990s, leagues (such as the [[VFL/AFL]] or [[SANFL]]), as well as [[football club]]s, have named their best team (see [[Football (Australian rules) positions]]).  Teams of the decades followed.

One of the most famous examples of the team of the century concept was in 1996, when the [[Australian Football League#Team of the Century|AFL Team of the Century]] was named on 2 September 1996, during the League's centenary season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Footystats/TOTC.html|title=Teams of the Century|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507043415/http://footystats.freeservers.com/Footystats/TOTC.html|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example from [[Ireland]] was when in 1984 the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] selected their [[GAA Football Team of the Century|Football Team of the Century]]&lt;ref&gt;Corry, Eoghan (2005). ''The GAA Book of Lists''. Hodder Headline Ireland. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GAA Hurling Team of the Century|Hurling Team of the Century]] to celebrate the first 100 years of the GAA.  The term was used again in 2011 when the Team of Century from the [[Sigerson Cup]] was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/2/0802111530-ulster-bank-sigerson-team-of-the-century/|title=Ulster Bank Sigerson Cup Team of the Century|date=February 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226014400/http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/2/0802111530-ulster-bank-sigerson-team-of-the-century/|archivedate=February 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Ashes urn in 1921 when it was still owned by Lord Darnley (Ivo Bligh).]]

'''The Ashes urn''' is a small [[urn]] made of [[terracotta]] and standing 11&amp;nbsp;cm high, believed to contain the ashes of a burnt [[bail (cricket)|cricket bail]]. It was presented to [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]], the captain of the [[England cricket team]], as a personal gift after a friendly match hosted at [[Rupertswood]] mansion in [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882–83|1882–83 tour in Australia]]. After his death the urn was presented to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], which has it on display at [[Lord's]] cricket ground in London. The urn has come to be strongly associated with '[[The Ashes]]', the prize for which England and [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] are said to compete in [[Test cricket|Test series]] between the two countries.

==The origin of the urn==
[[File:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|thumb|The death notice that appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'']]
[[File:English cricket team 1883.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An etching of the English cricket team that toured Australia in 1882-83 in the Australasian newspaper of 1882.]]
[[File:The Ashes English Team 1883.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The English Cricket Team that toured Australia in 1882-83. They were captained by Ivo Bligh. Standing: William Barnes, Frederick Morley, Charles Thomas Studd, George Frederick Vernon, Charles Frederick Henry Leslie. Centre Row: George Browne Studd, Edward Ferdinando Sutton Tylecote, Ivo Bligh (captain), Allan Gibson Steel, Walter William Read. Front Row: Richard Gorton Barlow, Willie Bates.]]
On 29 August 1882 Australia defeated England in a cricket match played at [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]], [[London]]. There was a great deal of dismay felt by the English about this loss and a few days later a mock obituary notice written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]] appeared in the [[The Sporting Times|Sporting Times]] which read:

"In affectionate remembrance of English Cricket which died at the Oval on 29 August 1882. Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. RIP. NB. The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia."&lt;ref&gt;The Sporting Times, 31 August 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time the term 'the ashes' had been mentioned.

It had previously been arranged that a cricket team captained by [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] would tour Australia in 1882-83 and this team became the English hope of victory. Before leaving England for Australia, Bligh pledged to bring back "The Ashes of English cricket".&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main Test matches were played. The first was in [[Melbourne]] and was won by [[Australia]]. The second was also in Melbourne and won by the English. The third match was in [[Sydney]] and was again won by the English. After this it was generally acknowledged that the English were the victors. 

After the conclusion of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1415649 The International Cricket Match. England v. United Australia] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 February 1883, p. 10, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. pages 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' made it very clear that this game was not part of the international "rubber" which had in fact been won by England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13529090 Cricket. The International Matches] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 February 1883, p. 11, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour.

The urn was made during the 1882-83 tour. It is a very small red terracotta artefact which some believe could be a perfume bottle. Two labels are pasted on it: the top label says "The Ashes"; the lower label is a verse cut out from ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' magazine of 1 February 1883 which reads:

:''"When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;''
:''[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A. G. Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;''
:''The welkin will ring loud,''
:''The great crowd will feel proud,''
:''Seeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;''
:''And the rest coming home with the urn.''"

These names are some of the men in the English team. Many of them are shown in the pictures above.

There is also an associated red velvet bag with a Victor’s Olive Crown embroidered on it in yellow silk cotton with the emblem “1883” in the middle of it. This bag was made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, wife of the [[John Walter Fletcher|manager]] of the NSW team, in early 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The presentation of the urn==

[[File:Ivo Bligh circa 1890.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Ivo Bligh (later Lord Darnley) who was the recipient of the Ashes urn.]]
Reports have established that the estate of [[Rupertswood]] in [[Sunbury, Victoria]] is the birthplace of the Ashes urn legend. According to a 1908 newspaper report in the ''Hobart Mercury'', an unnamed writer from the ''Westminster Gazette'' recalled that a group of Melbourne ladies which included [[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]], and [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], presented "a tiny silver urn, containing what they termed 'the ashes of Australian (''sic'') cricket.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12673335 Cricket] ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]'', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|The Hon. Ivo Bligh]], captain of the English touring team after one of the three Tests in 1882-83.
 
Rupertswood was the home of [[Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet|Sir William Clarke]] and [[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]]. Sir William was president of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]]. At Christmas 1882 and again at Easter 1883, the members of the English cricket team were his guests.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A divergent story about the presentation of the urn is that on Christmas Eve, prior to the start of the three-test series, and after a friendly match between the English cricketers and a combination of staff and guests held at Rupertswood, the urn was presented by Lady Clarke to Bligh in a joking fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Also present on this occasion was the Clarkes' music teacher, Florence Morphy, who was later to marry Ivo Bligh.

There has been some disagreement with this version of events mainly because of three issues. Firstly the verse on the urn was not published in Punch until 1 February 1883 which is five weeks after the Christmas event. Secondly there are statements by both Lord Darnley and Lady Darnley that the presentation happened sometime after the Third Test.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Darnley’s statement is in Cricket Field, 30 June 1894. Lady Darnley’s statement was given to Lady Mildred Allsop and quoted in Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Test finished in Sydney on 30 January 1883. Thirdly the accompanying red velvet bag made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, was not made until early 1883.

Joy Munns has taken these problems into account and has concluded that there were two quite separate presentations of the same urn. It was presented firstly at Rupertswood at Christmas and was merely the perpetuation of a joke. The second and most documented event was at Easter (which was around 25 March 1883) at Rupertswood after all the formal matches had finished. On this occasion Joy Munns says the verse was pasted on the urn, it was placed in the red velvet bag and given to Bligh.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Clarke and Florence Morphy were both present on this occasion. This version of the presentation being in late March is supported by a statement made by Lord Darnley who said in 1921 that he was presented with the urn by "some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm="cobham hall" urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192 International Cricket: The Ashes] ''[[Geraldton Guardian]]'', 15 February 1921, page 1, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; England in fact won the series 2-1.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154318.html |title=England in Australia, 1882–83|publisher=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bligh's 'final defeat' refers to a non-Test game in Melbourne on 12 March 1883 when they were defeated by the Victorian cricket team in the last formal match of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Easter many of the English team were guests at Rupertswood and did not embark on the return voyage to England until 29 March. Ivo Bligh stayed for another five weeks during which time it is believed he became engaged to Florence Morphy. He sailed for England on 5 May but returned to Australia in February 1884. Four days after his arrival, on 9 February,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63185850 Summary of Events] ''[[The Illustrated Australian News]]'', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; he married Florence at St Mary's Church in Sunbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93148475 Marriage of the Hon.

[[File:The Ashes Urn Replica (2016).jpg|150px|thumb|right|A modern-day replica of the Ashes Urn]]
After their honeymoon in [[Australia]] the couple went to [[England]] in August 1884 where they stayed at [[Cobham Hall]] in [[Kent]]. The English papers reported that Florence was warmly welcomed by the Bligh family on her arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Traralgon Record and Morwell, Mirboo, Toongabbie, Heyfield, Tyers and Callignee Advertiser (Traralgon, Victoria), 29 August 1884 p. 4.  http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71545607?searchTerm=ivo bligh &amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|||l-year=1884&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in England for the next 18 months and then returned to Melbourne in January 1886. It was reported at this time that they intended to stay in [[Australia]] for about one year because of Ivo Bligh’s health.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Star (Lismore, NSW ) 17 March 1886, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Melbourne]] they lived in a house called Hazelwell in Powlett St East Melbourne and in November 1886 Florence had her first child.&lt;ref&gt;The Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil (Melbourne), 4 November 1886.    http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63225550?searchTerm=hazelwell melbourne&amp;searchLimits=&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1887 the couple returned to England&lt;ref&gt;The Mercury (Hobart)  11 June 1887. Online reference   http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9134921?searchTerm=ivo bligh&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|||l-year=1887&lt;/ref&gt; and for some time lived at Cobham Hall.&lt;ref&gt;England Census 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Bligh had a position in the wine merchant firm of Morgan Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Town and Country Journal (NSW)  18 January 1890  p 38. http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71106705?searchTerm="ivo bligh"&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 after the death of his brother Bligh became the Earl of Darnley and inherited [[Cobham Hall]]. The Ashes urn remained at the Hall until Bligh’s death in 1927.

Lord Darnley had an interview in 1921 with Montague Grover, a well-known Australian journalist, at his home in Cobham Hall. Grover says that the urn was kept in Darnley’s den where all his other treasured cricket memorabilia were placed. He had numerous photos of the other team players on the wall as well as a leather-bound copy of the original account of the 1882-83 cricket tour of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1. Online reference http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm="cobham hall" urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bligh’s death Florence presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1929. It was placed in the [[Long Room]] at the Lord’s Pavilion until 1953, when it was transferred to the Cricket Museum next to the Pavilion. A photo of the urn in the Long Room in 1929 is shown at the left.

After the urn was first displayed at Lord's it produced a gradual change in the public perception of 'The Ashes'. In 1933 it was displayed in the National Sporting Trophies Exhibition in London with some of the world’s great sporting memorabilia. To the public the urn was becoming the image and symbol of 'The Ashes'.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until after about 1950 that the cricket books and paraphernalia almost exclusively used representation of the urn to depict 'The Ashes'. From about 1989 images of the Australian Test cricketers with replicas of the urn appeared in the media.

Since 1929 the urn has returned to [[Australia]] only twice – once when it was brought to Sydney for the Bicentenary Test Match in 1988 and secondly in 2006 for the tour of the Ashes Exhibition to each state capital of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|right|thumb|King [[Philip II of Spain]], wearing the Spanish ''Tocado'', late 1500s. Painting by [[Sofonisba Anguissola]].]]
A '''toque''' ({{IPAc-en|t|oʊ|k}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/toque|title=the definition of toque|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|t|ɒ|k}}) is a type of [[hat]] with a narrow [[Brim (hat)|brim]] or no brim at all.&lt;ref name="merriam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toque | title=Definition of Toque | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toques were popular from the 13th to the 16th century in Europe, especially France. The mode was revived in the 1930s. Now it is primarily known as the traditional headgear for professional [[cook (profession)|cooks]], except in Canada where the term is primarily used for [[knit cap]]s.&lt;ref name="merriam" /&gt;
[[File:Woman's Toque LACMA M.64.85.6.jpg|thumb|Woman's toque from England, c. 1860 at the collection of [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]

== Etymology ==
The word has been known in English since 1505. It came through the [[Medieval]] [[French language|French]] toque (15th century), presumably by the way of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''toca'' "woman's headdress", from Arabic *''taqa'' 'طاقة' for "opening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=toque | title=toque (n.) | publisher=Etymonline.com | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "طاقية" "taqia"  for "hat" originally for something "round" that has an opening. 

The word toque is [[Breton language|Breton]] for "hat".  The spelling with the "que" is Middle Breton, and Modern Breton is spelled tok.  Old Breton spells the word toc.  The word was borrowed into the French language both for the chef's uniform and the knit cap.

==Usage==

A '''''toque blanche''''' ([[French language|French]] for "white hat"), often shortened to toque, is a tall, round, pleated, starched white hat worn by [[chef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogmybrain.com/scrabble-word-finder/word/toque.htm | title=Definitions for: Toque | accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toque most likely originated as the result of the gradual evolution of head coverings worn by cooks throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUdYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=toque+head+coverings | title=So, You Want to Be a Chef?: How to Get Started in the World of Culinary Arts | publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | author= Bedell, Jane | year=2013 | page=69 | isbn=1582704368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their roots are sometimes traced to the ''casque à meche'' (stocking cap) worn by 18th-century French chefs. The colour of the ''casque à meche'' denoted the rank of the wearer. Boucher, the personal chef of the French statesman [[Talleyrand]], was the first to insist on white toques for sanitary reasons.

The modern toque is popularly believed to have originated with the French chef [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] (1784&amp;ndash;1833), who stiffened  the ''casque à meche'' with cardboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/magazine/who-made-that-chefs-toque.html|title=Who Made That Chef’s Toque?|first=Daniel|last=Engber|date=28 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- and [[Auguste Escoffier]] (1846&amp;ndash;1935) --&gt;.

===Judicial===
* A toque, or sometimes touge, was the traditional headgear of various French [[magistrate]]s.
* A low type in black velvet, called ''[[mortar board|mortier]]'' (also rendered in English as [[mortarboard]]), was used by the ''[[président à mortier]]'', president of a ''[[parlement]]'' (the royal highest court in a French province), and of the members of two of the highest central courts, ''[[Court of Cassation (France)|cour de cassation]]'' and ''[[Cour des Comptes|cour des comptes]]''.
* A red toque is sometimes worn by German judges, primarily by justices on the [[Federal Constitutional Court]].

===Academic===
The pleated, low, round hat worn in French universities{{spaced ndash}} the equivalent of the [[mortarboard]] or [[tam (cap)|tam]] at British and American universities{{spaced ndash}} is also called a toque.

===Heraldic===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In the [[Napoleonic era]], the French first empire replaced the [[coronet]]s of traditional ("royal") [[heraldry]] with a rigorously standardized system (as other respects of "Napoleonic" [[coats of arms]]) of toques, reflecting the rank of the bearer. Thus a Napoleonic [[duke]] used a toque with seven [[ostrich]] feathers and three [[lambrequin]]s, a [[count]] a toque with five feathers and two lambrequins, a [[baron]] three feathers and one lambrequin, a [[knight]] only one ostrich feather (see [[Nobility of the First French Empire]]).

In [[Canadian English|Canada]], ''[[tuque]]'' {{IPAc-en|t|uː|k}} is the common name for a knitted winter hat, or [[watch cap]] (sometimes called a beanie in other parts of the world); the spelling "touque", although not recognized by the [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]], is also sometimes seen in written English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/thousands-vote-on-correct-spelling-of-canadian-knit-cap-1.2457737, CBC News: Thousands vote on correct spelling of Canadian knit cap, Retrieved Dec. 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian English|Canadian-English]] term was assimilated from [[Canadian French language|Canadian-French]] ''[[wikt:tuque#French|tuque]]''. ''Toque'' first appeared in writing around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"toque" and "tuque" in Katherine Barber, ed. (2004), ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' (2nd ed.), Don Mills, Ontario: [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-541816-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tuque tuque]" at Dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toque toque]" and "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuque tuque]" at Merriam–Webster Online.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fashion is said to have originated with the ''[[coureurs de bois]]'', French and [[Métis]] fur traders, who kept their woollen nightcaps on for warmth during cold winter days. Such hats are known in other English-speaking countries by a variety of names, including ''beanie'', ''watch cap'' or ''stocking cap''; the terms ''tuque'' and ''toque'' are unique to Canada and northern areas of the United States close to the [[Canada–United States border]].

[[File:Lukova building.jpg|thumb|300px|Ski resort [[Jasná]] in Central [[Slovakia]]]]
A '''winter sport''' or '''winter activity''' is a recreational activity or [[sport]] which is played on snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=winter+sports&amp;title=21st|title=winter sports, noun|work=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most such sports are variations of [[skiing]], [[ice skating]] and [[sledding]]. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during [[winter]], but [[artificial snow]] and [[artificial ice]] allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide [[ice rink]]s for [[ice skating]], [[ice hockey]] and [[bandy]] in a milder climate.

Common individual sports include [[cross-country skiing]], [[Alpine skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ski jumping]], [[speed skating]], [[figure skating]], [[luge]], [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]], [[bobsleigh]] and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. Common team sports include [[ice hockey]], [[curling]] and [[bandy]]. Based on the number of participants, ice hockey is by far the world's most popular winter sport, followed by bandy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Winter sports often have their own multi-sport tournaments, such as the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

==History==
Snow and ice during the wintertime has led to other means of transportation, such as sledges, skis and skates. This also led to different pastimes and sports being developed in the winter season as compared to other times of the year. Naturally, winter sports are more popular in countries with longer winter seasons.

While most winter sports are played outside, ice hockey, speed skating and to some extent bandy have moved indoors starting in the mid-20th century. Indoor [[ice rink]]s with [[artificial ice]] allow [[ice skating]] and [[hockey]] to be played in hot climates.

==List of winter sports==
'''''Note''''': the Olympic rings next to a sport indicates that this particular sport is included in the [[Winter Olympic Games]], as of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The Paralympic logo indicates the same for a sport not in the Olympics but in the [[Winter Paralympic Games]].

The '''World Poker Tour bracelet''' is the [[World Poker Tour]]'s (WPT) answer to the [[World Series of Poker]] (WSOP) [[World Series of Poker bracelet|bracelet]].  Beginning in 1976, the WSOP started awarding bracelets to winners of WSOP events.  The WSOP bracelet has become synonymous with greatness.  "It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously," stated World Series of Poker Commissioner [[Jeffrey Pollack]] during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. "It is the equivalent of winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[ice hockey|hockey]] or the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Lombardi Trophy]] in [[American football|football]]."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Earl. [http://www.pokernews.com/news/2006/6/world-series-poker-bracelet.htm 2006 World Series of Poker Bracelet Unveiled]. June 7, 2006. ''Pokernews.com'' Accessed July 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Since their introduction, a poker player's success has been measured by the number of bracelets they had won.  With introduction of the WPT bracelet, the WPT hopes to capitalize on the prestige of winning poker bracelets.  WPT Founder, President and CEO, Steve Lipscomb said, "The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that [[Benny Binion]] [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS132757+08-Apr-2008+BW20080408|title=Six Seasons of Champions to Receive WPT Championship Bracelet|date=2008-04-08|work=Reuters|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the event champions during the first six seasons did not initially receive bracelets, the WPT presented them with bracelets at a special event at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] on April 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internet-poker.co.uk/Poker-News/General-Poker-News/World-Poker-Tour-Giving-96-Winners-Bracelets~2391.html|title=World Poker Tour Giving 96 Winners Bracelets|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bracelets are made from [[titanium]] and [[diamond]] by [[Tiffany and Company]].  The HendonMob, a respected online poker site, describes the bracelet, "A diamond bracelet commissioned by Tiffany might sound nice in principle but the first pictures of them released by the WPT have not been especially well received. In fact they look a bit like a [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] accessory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehendonmob.com/poker_news/2008/11th_of_april|title=Poker News Round-up: Week #15|date = 2008-04-11|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
