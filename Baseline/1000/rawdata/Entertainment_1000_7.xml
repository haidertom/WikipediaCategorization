The '''opening ceremony for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]''' was held at [[Celtic Park]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, between 21:00 and 23:40 BST, on 23 July 2014.

==Parade of Nations==
The ceremony was directed by [[David Zolkwer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/24/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-glasgow-review |title=Commonwealth Games opening ceremony review – no lack of heart but a lack of oomph |last=Gardner |first=Lyn|authorlink=Lyn Gardner|date=24 July 2014|website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the [[2014 Commonwealth Games Parade of Nations]] where 71 athletes, bearing the flags of their respective nations and territories, led their national delegations as they paraded into the stadium. The games were formally opened by [[Her Majesty (style)|Her Majesty]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. She referred to the Commonwealth's "shared ideals and ambitions" and the "bonds that unite" its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncanson|first=Hilary|date= 23 July 2014|title=Queen tells of 'shared ideals' at Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/queen-tells-of-shared-ideals-at-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-30455671.html|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|agency=[[Press Association]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==

The programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured [[Karen Dunbar]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Susan Boyle]], [[Nicola Benedetti]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Pumeza Matshikiza]], [[Eric Whitacre]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]], as well as a message from the [[International Space Station]]. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]], explaining the partnership between the Games and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014-opening-ceremony-ewan-mcgregor-launches-unicef-charity-fundraiser-during-performance-9624536.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrival of the Queen there was a [[flypast]] by the [[Red Arrows]] display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Withnall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014--on-your-marks-glasgow-ready-for-opening-ceremony-as-scotland-promises-to-show-what-were-made-of-9623129.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2014 – on your marks: Glasgow ready for opening ceremony as Scotland promises to show ‘what we’re made of’ – Commonwealth Games – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=19 March 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplied by Sports Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/media-centre/press-releases/sports-technology-showcase-all-bigscreen-action-glasgow-2014 |title=Sports Technology to showcase all the big-screen action of Glasgow 2014 &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's then First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] disaster.

The final part of the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to [[Chris Hoy|Sir Chris Hoy]], who delivered  it to President of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] HRH [[Tunku Muda Serting Imran|Prince Imran]] and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed "to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/about-us/our-sponsors/unicef |title=Unicef &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

An '''aristeia''' or '''aristia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ᵻ|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc|ἀριστεία}} {{IPA-el|aristěːaː|}}, ''"excellence"'') is a scene in the dramatic conventions of epic poetry as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', where a [[hero]] in battle has his finest moments (''aristos'' = "best"). An aristeia can result in the death of the hero at the aristeia's end.

==Examples==
One of the most prototypical examples of ''aristeia'' is in ''Book 21'' of the Iliad when [[Achilles]] almost single-handedly routs the [[Troy|Trojan]] army. This  includes his chase of [[Hector]] around [[Troy]]; Achilles eventually succeeds in killing him and dragging his corpse around the city.&lt;ref name=Iliad&gt;{{cite book|last=Homer|title=The Iliad|year=800 BC|page=Book XXI|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.21.xxi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of this phenomenon in the ''Iliad'' are found in [[Diomedes]]' performance in battle while empowered by [[Athena]] (''Book V''), [[Hector]]'s leading of the Trojan assault on the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaian]] camp in ''Book VIII'' (with the help of [[Zeus]]), [[Agamemnon]]'s aristeia in Book XI where he's on such a rampage that Zeus himself has to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as [[Patroclus]]' aristeia in ''Book XVI'', which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of [[Hector]]. In ''Book XXII'' of the [[Odyssey]], Greek hero [[Odysseus]] slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence.
It is also seen, to some extent, in the [[Aeneid]], when [[Nisus and Euryalus]] leave the Trojan defenses to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep. It also features in ''Book X'', when [[Mezentius]] takes the place of [[Turnus]] and strikes down all in his path: it draws upon homeric models, using a [[simile]].

'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

The '''Avenue of Stars''' was a version of the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="usa-today04"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-08-23-page-walk-of-fame_x.htm|title=Page gets first star on British Walk of Fame|first=Carl|last=De Souza|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=23 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 2005 with one hundred names, and was a temporary installation to accompany a TV show to celebrate ITV's 50th birthday. The Avenue of Stars was a walkway through [[Covent Garden]] passing [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's Church]], commonly known as the "Actors' Church". It honoured individuals or groups from the entertainment industry with notable achievements. As on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the individual or group was represented by a five-pointed star containing the name set into the walkway. To qualify for a star, the individual or group had to have been from the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The first inductee onto the Avenue of Stars was [[Jimmy Page]], guitarist with [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref name="usa-today04"/&gt; In 2006, all of the stars were removed, {{Why|date=January 2017}} and only the old flagstones are visible in the courtyard. American singer/songwriter Is'real Benton formed a U.S.-based eponymous foundation to restore the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Sights_and_Attractions/Avenue_of_the_Stars/9702|title=Avenue of the Stars Covent Garden London|publisher=londontown.com|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CSI''''' is a [[media franchise]] of American [[television program]]s created by [[Anthony E. Zuiker]]. The first three ''CSI'' series follow the work of forensic scientists as they unveil the circumstances behind mysterious deaths, while the fourth series, ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'', emphasizes behavioral psychology and how it can be applied to cyber forensics.  

''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]],'' began on October 6, 2000, and ran for fifteen full seasons. Starring [[William Petersen]], [[Ted Danson]], [[Marg Helgenberger]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]], the series concluded its run with a two-hour finale entitled ''[[Immortality (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation)|Immortality]]'' on September 27, 2015. The series original lead characters, [[Gil Grissom]] and [[Catherine Willows]], were based upon LVMPD Crime Scene Analysts Daniel Holstein and Yolanda McClary.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (December 5, 2000).

In 2004, ''CSI: Miami'' spun off ''[[CSI: NY]]'', the third series in the franchise and the only indirect spin-off of ''CSI''. It was canceled after nine seasons on May 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Lesley (May 10, 2013).

''Cyber'' premiered in 2015, and starred [[Patricia Arquette]] and franchise alum Ted Danson – the only actor to appear as a series regular in more than one ''CSI'' series. The lead character, [[Avery Ryan]], was inspired by cyber-psychologist Mary Aiken who was attached to the series as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;Hibberd, James (March 5, 2014).

The CSI franchise is available in 200 territories with an audience of two billion people.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;Gilbert, Gerard (December 19, 2006). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/csi-the-cop-show-that-conquered-the-world-429262.html "''CSI'': The cop show that conquered the world"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] have been developed to cater for the market including novels, comic books, and computer games.

The franchise has had a large cultural impact. It has spawned what has been called the "[[CSI effect|''CSI'' effect]]," in which juries often have unreasonable expectations of real-life forensics because of what they have seen on ''CSI''. Equally, the new-found popularity of forensics dramas on television has led to an increase in applications for courses dealing with [[forensic science]] or [[archaeological science]]—in the United Kingdom applications are up by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Paul (March 28, 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2044244,00.html "Want a career in forensics? Here's some hard evidence"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise is so influential that fellow CBS show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' advertised itself as "not a Crime Scene Investigation show".&lt;ref&gt;CBS (August 20, 2007). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjJCdwTauLs "''How I Met Your Mother'' -- CSI: Style"]. [[YouTube]]. Retrieved February 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways the franchise may also fill a cultural need:
{{quote|"We started in 2000 and it was a success, but our ratings really shot up after the September 11 attacks," Zuiker says in a documentary about the ''CSI'' phenomenon to be aired at Christmas [2007]. "People were rushing to us for their comfort food. There was a sense of justice in ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' – it helped to know that there were people like our characters out there helping to solve crimes. And, of course, 9/11 was the world's largest crime scene."&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;}}
However, the "''CSI'' effect" also has a negative side, as criminals are frequently covering up evidence that could be used to trace them using techniques learned by watching CSI and other shows in the same genre.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Ted (February 15, 2006). [http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/02/15/btsc.rowlands/index.html "'CSI effect' cuts both ways: Experts say crime shows help law enforcement and criminals"]. [[CNN]]. Retrieved April 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series===

=== Las Vegas ===
'''Methods'''&lt;br&gt;
The Las Vegas team are scientists foremost and follow the evidence.

'''Crimes'''&lt;br&gt;
The crimes the Las Vegas CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include casino robberies, bodies buried in the Nevada desert, and murders during different conventions at casinos.

'''Crime lab'''&lt;br&gt;
The [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] Crime Lab is a modern crime lab and shares a lot (but not a building) with the Las Vegas Police Department. It reports to the sheriff's office. In early episodes of season one the lab is frequently referred to as the number-two crime lab in the United States, solving cases believed unsolvable. The lab consists of specialist laboratories, a Supervisor's office, an Assistant Supervisor's office, a locker room, a break-room, and stairs leading to a second floor, believed to house the offices of the Day-shift and Swing-shift supervisors. 

* Laboratory Directors: D.B. Russell &lt;small&gt;(12.01–16.02)&lt;/small&gt;, Sara Sidle &lt;small&gt;(16.02)&lt;/small&gt;
* Night Shift Supervisors: Jim Brass &lt;small&gt;(1.01)&lt;/small&gt;, Gil Grissom &lt;small&gt;(1.02–9.10)&lt;/small&gt;,  Catherine Willows &lt;small&gt;(9.11–11.22)&lt;/small&gt;, D.B. Russell &lt;small&gt;(12.01–16.02)&lt;/small&gt;

=== Miami ===
'''Methods'''&lt;br&gt;
The Miami team are detectives foremost and mainly use theories to solve crimes.

'''Crimes'''&lt;br&gt;
The crimes the Miami CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include drug running, murdered refugees from Cuba, bodies found washed up on the beach and dumped in the everglades, and crimes involving the rich and famous who have secrets to hide in their mansions and beach front properties.

'''Crime lab'''&lt;br&gt;
First stationed out of a broom-closet next to the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|MDPD's]] bull-pen in the backdoor pilot, the Miami CSI's were eventually given their own building prior to the start of the first season. Originally dark and technical the building housed Horatio's office, Megan's office, specialist labs, and a locker room. During the fourth season a government grant meant that slanted glass walls, multiple modern labs, an interrogation room, and a new locker room were all constructed. Horatio's office has not been seen since the lab's reconstruction although a state-of-the-art ballistics suite was added, acting as Calleigh's office. The lab has reinforced windows and shutters to protect against hurricanes and tsunamis.  

* Laboratory Director &amp; Day Shift Supervisor: Horatio Caine &lt;small&gt;(Backdoor pilot–10.19)&lt;/small&gt;
* Assistant Day Shift Supervisors: Megan Donner &lt;small&gt;(1.01–1.10)&lt;/small&gt;, Calleigh Duquesne &lt;small&gt;(1.11–10.19)&lt;/small&gt;

=== New York ===
'''Methods'''&lt;br&gt;
The New York team are equally scientists and detectives and frequently use criminal profiling (as well as evidence and theories) to solve cases.

'''Crimes'''&lt;br&gt;
The crimes the New York CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include organised crime activity involving the Italian Mafia, street-gang violence, and ethnic, cultural, and ability differences.

'''Crime lab'''&lt;br&gt;
During the first season the  [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] CSI lab was in an old underground building with rustic brick walls. The lab housed Mac's office, a locker room, the autopsy suite, and specialist forensic laboratories. As of the second season the lab is on the 35th floor of a high-rise building in Manhattan. Equipped with glass walls and state-of-the-art equipment this lab consists of Mac's office, specialist laboratories, an observation walkway, a break-room and kitchen, a locker room, an office belonging to the Assistant Supervisor and Lindsay, and an office belonging to Danny and Hawkes. Part of this second lab was blown up in the season three finale, "Snow Day", but was restored by the beginning of season four. 

* Laboratory Director &amp; Day Shift Supervisor: Mac Taylor &lt;small&gt;(Backdoor pilot–9.17)&lt;/small&gt;
* Assistant Day Shift Supervisors: Stella Bonasera &lt;small&gt;(Backdoor pilot–6.23)&lt;/small&gt;, Jo Danville &lt;small&gt;(7.01–9.17)&lt;/small&gt;

=== Washington, D.C. ===
'''Methods'''&lt;br&gt;
The Cyber team focuses on the technical aspect of crimes, with NextGen forensics providing it with a real-world crime scene investigative counterpart. 

'''Crimes'''&lt;br&gt;
The FBI Cyber Crime Division investigates cyber-based terrorism, internet-related murders, espionage, computer intrusions, major cyber-fraud, cyber-theft, hacking, sex offenses, blackmail, and any other crime deemed to be cyber-related within the FBI's jurisdiction.

'''Divisions'''&lt;br&gt;
'''— Cyber Crime Division'''&lt;br&gt;The [[FBI Cyber Division|FBI Cyber Crime Division]] operates out of Washington, D.C. and is housed in the Cyber Threat Operations Center. The CTOC consists of Ryan's office, Russell's office, a communications bullpen housing the desks of Krumitz, Nelson, and Ramirez, a cyber lab, a glass walkway, and a 'tear-down room'. Due to their nomadic nature the team are often seen interviewing suspects at various FBI field offices and police departments.
* FBI Directors: FBI Director Marcus Silver, FBI Assistant Deputy Director Simon Sifter &lt;small&gt;(1.01–1.13)&lt;/small&gt;, FBI Deputy Director Colin Vickner &lt;small&gt;(1.01–2.04)&lt;/small&gt;, FBI Deputy Director Avery Ryan &lt;small&gt;(2.06–2.18)&lt;/small&gt;
* Special Agent in Charge: Avery Ryan &lt;small&gt;(Backdoor pilot–2.05)&lt;/small&gt;

'''— Next Generation Cyber Forensics Division'''&lt;br&gt;The Next Generation Cyber Forensics Division is a lab-based facility within the Cyber Crime Division used for the processing of evidence in cyber-related cases.

==Crossovers==
[[Fictional crossover|Crossover]]s are possible between ''CSI'' series as well as with other programs within the same creative stable. Between the series the baton is passed to the new ''CSI'' series via a crossover/[[Television pilot|pilot]] where cases are overlapped and personnel are shared. Many actors have appeared in two of the series. Four actors have appeared in three: David Caruso, Laurence Fishburne, and Gary Sinise all appeared in ''CSI'', ''CSI: Miami'', and ''CSI: NY'', while [[Ted Danson]] appeared as a guest star on ''CSI: NY'' and a series regular on both ''CSI'' and ''CSI: Cyber'', making him the first actor to be a main character in more than one ''CSI'' series. Crossovers have also, on occasion, taken place between a ''CSI'' series and a series outside the franchise.

===Toys===
A range of toys have been developed. These include:
* "''CSI'': Forensics Lab"
* "''CSI'': DNA Laboratory"
* "''CSI'': Forensic Facial"
However, they have been the source of some controversy. The [[Parents Television Council]], who have complained about ''CSI'' in general, in 2004 released a statement specifically aimed at the toys.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jimmy (November 17, 2004).

Retrieved October 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The PTC e-mailed letters to their supporters, telling them the content of the games were entirely inappropriate for children to be exposed to "because the ''CSI'' franchise often displays graphic images, including close-ups of corpses with gunshot wounds and other bloody injuries." The letter went on to say "The PTC doesn't think the recreation of blood, guts and gore should be under a child's Christmas tree this year," PTC concluded. "This so-called 'toy' is a blatant attempt to market ''CSI'' and its adult-oriented content directly to children."

In urging members to file a complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]], PTC said CBS parent company Viacom needed to hear from parents who are concerned about the "graphic scenes of blood, violence, and sex" in their product.

==Documentaries==
Because of the popularity of the ''CSI'' franchise in the United Kingdom, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] created two [[Documentary film|documentaries]] about CSI. The first one called ''The Real CSI'' follows real crime scene investigators as they work on crime scene. The second documentary, ''True CSI'', features true tales of how forensic science has helped solve some of the world's best known crimes. ''True CSI'' had actors re-enacting the crime as well as interviews with people involved in the solving of the crimes themselves. Cases featured included the [[Sam Sheppard]] case.

In early 2007, British channel [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]] broadcast a special of its flagship documentary ''[[Tonight (TV programme)|Tonight with Trevor McDonald]]'' discussing the ramifications of the "[[CSI effect|''CSI'' effect]]", highlighting the effect not only of the franchise but of several other British and American TV police procedurals.

The popularity of the series has also spawned forensic based [[reality television]]/[[Documentary film|documentary]] programs, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[The First 48]]'' and [[truTV]]'s ''[[North Mission Road]].''

In April 2012, [[PBS]]' ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' aired a documentary called "The Real CSI" investigating the limitations of the CSI techniques in forensic science.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/real-csi/ "The Real CSI"].

'''Charles William Ingram''' (born 1963) is an English former [[British Army]] [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] who became known for cheating on the television [[game show]] ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' in 2001, after winning the maximum prize of a million pounds. Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, he was convicted on a single count of [[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]. In 2003, he was convicted of an unrelated insurance fraud, and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the [[Army Board]].

Ingram is married to Diana Ingram, and has since participated in other television shows, including ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|The Weakest Link]]'', ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'', ''[[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', and on ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]''.

==Education and career==
In 1986, he trained for the [[British Army|Army]] at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and was commissioned as an [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Royal Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50733 |date=1 December 1986 |page=15537 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the rank of [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52131 |date=8 May 1990 |page=8819 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and major in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54173 |date=2 October 1995 |pages=13315–13316  |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999, he served in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] for six months on [[NATO]] [[peacekeeping]] duties.
He was forced to resign from the Army in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57069 |date=30 September 2003 |page=12055 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News–Army"&gt;{{cite news|title=Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=24 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: ''The Network'', published on 27 April 2006, and ''Deep Siege'', published on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/i/charles-ingram/deep-siege.htm |title=Deep Siege by Charles Ingram |accessdate=17 December 2012 |date=8 October 2007 | work=Fantastic Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 and 10 September 2001, Ingram was a contestant on the television game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. His wife Diana Ingram and her brother Adrian Pollock had previously been contestants on the show, both winning £32,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2823407.stm |title=Major Charles Ingram has been found guilty of cheating his way to the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=7 April 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Martin Bashir]] |year=2003 |title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Major Fraud |medium=Television |publisher=ITV |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, presented by [[Chris Tarrant]], was one of the highest-rated in the United Kingdom at its peak in 1999; one edition was watched by 19 million viewers, a third of the British population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vdqdw9/15-years-of-the-coughing-major-who-wants-to-be-a-millionare|title=That Time a Guy Won 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' by Cheating Terribly|date=2016-09-09|work=Vice|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time recording ended on the first day, Ingram had reached £4,000 and used two of his three "lifelines". The production team doubted he would proceed much further when recording resumed, but he went on to win the top prize of £1 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ingram flipped between answers erratically, appearing to settle on one answer before suddenly moving to another. For example, when asked who recorded the 2000 [[Craig David]] album ''[[Born to Do It]]'', Ingram said he had "never heard of" David and appeared to go for a different option before moving to the correct answer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The show's production company [[Celador]] suspended the £1 million payout after they suspected Ingram had cheated. Production staff accused Ingram and his wife of defrauding the show by having an accomplice in the audience, lecturer Tecwen Whittock, cough when Ingram read out a correct answer.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Tarrant, who drank champagne with the Ingrams in their dressing room, said he was convinced that Ingram was genuine when he signed the £1 million cheque: "If I thought there was anything wrong, I certainly would not have signed it." When asked whether the atmosphere in the dressing room was tense after the show, Tarrant replied: "No, not at all. They seemed as normal as people who have just won a million pounds would be in the situation." However, he said that on his way to the dressing room, "I had been told there had been quite an unpleasant exchange."&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; A member of the crew, Eve Winstanley, testified in court that Ingram seemed "very unhappy" for someone who had just won a million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2836937.stm|title=Millionaire winner 'unhappy'|date=10 March 2003|accessdate=13 May 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celador employees produced and reviewed various compilation tapes before and after contacting the police. Celador and their editing company, Editworks, retained all the tapes during the case and reproduced all tapes for the court.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In court, Paul Smith of Celador Productions confirmed that his company had previously produced a television programme involving witnesses in the case, for broadcast on ITV after the trial. The program, ''Tonight With Trevor McDonald – Major Fraud'', was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] a month after the trial, and credited with over 17 million viewers. Two weeks later, the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US, the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.

=== Trial ===
Following [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), which ended soon after a jury member was evicted for discussing the case in public, Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of "[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months), each fined £15,000, and each ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram £40,000 and Diana Ingram £25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay £115,000.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

On 19 August 2003, the [[Army Board]] ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major, after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2004, the [[Court of Appeal]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3728929.stm |title=TV quiz cheat loses his appeal |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 May 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2004, the House of Lords denied Ingram his leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. On 20 October 2004, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana Ingram's defence costs order to £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3762688.stm |title=Quiz cheat has defence costs cut |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=21 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, journalist [[Jon Ronson]], who covered the case at the time for the ''Guardian'', wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson had observed that when the word "cough" was mentioned during the trial, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. James Plaskett, who had won £250,000 on ''Millionaire'' and had been in the audience three times, argued that this was an example of coughs being caused by unconscious triggers; Tecwen had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Plaskett argued that Tecwen had audibly said "no" in response to an incorrect option in the same way that many audience members whisper "no" to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'' by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

Charles Ingram's fine and court costs, totalling £25,000, were later reduced to £5,000 on appeal.

''[[Quiz (play)|Quiz]]'', a play written by [[James_Graham_(playwright)|James Graham]] that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the [[Minerva_Theatre,_Chichester|Minerva Theatre]], [[Chichester]], on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/quiz |title=Quiz |accessdate=18 November 2017 |publisher=Chichester Festival Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play transferred to the West End—playing at the [[Noël Coward Theatre]] from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412123518/http://quiztheplay.com/|title=Quiz the Play by James Graham {{!}} Official West End Website|date=2018-04-12|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recorded evidence====
In court, Ingram claimed the video tape was "unrepresentative of what I heard", and he continues to assert that it was "unfairly manipulated". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and for the "benefit of the jury" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither "listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were "significant". The prosecution asserted that these "significant" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time after the correct answer had been spoken. [[Chris Tarrant]] also denied hearing any coughing in court, claiming he was too busy to notice.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/quizshowscam/Quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-1m.2410121.jp |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear £1m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====
Larry Whitehurst, another contestant who has appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.&lt;ref name="BBC News–Coughs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Contestant 'spotted Millionaire coughs'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2839587.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=11 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testimony of Tecwen Whittock====
Whittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,938649,00.html |title=So I phoned a friend – part two |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 April 2003 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answer.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager" /&gt; During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager" /&gt; Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2888791.stm |title=Cheating 'silly' says Millionaire accused |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=26 March 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to question number 12, regarding the artist who painted ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'', in a hand-written general knowledge book at his home.&lt;ref name="scotsman_pager"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Pager-plot-too-risky-for.2408136.jp |title=Pager plot too risky for TV quiz |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=7 March 2003 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=John |last=Innes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022105328/http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/pager-plot-too-risky-for-tv-quiz-1-548871|archivedate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies, the floor manager, said that, as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording, he decided to find out who was responsible. "The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three", he said. "He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough." Whittock remarked during the trial that "you do not cough into someone's face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portia.org/chapter14/major.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020172443/http://www.portia.org/chapter14/major.html |archivedate=20 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a "serial quiz show loser" because he had been eliminated in round one of ''[[Fifteen to One|15 to 1]]'' and had only won an atlas on his appearance on ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman_whittock"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=788&amp;id=360802003 |title=Lecturer a serial quiz show failure, court is told |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=26 March 2003 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman|last=Innes|first=John|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418205015/http://www.news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?id=360802003&amp;tid=788|archivedate=18 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance fraud==
In late 2003, the Ingrams were again in court, charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Charles Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth [[Crown Court]] of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell [[Direct Line]] Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. The court was told that Ingram had been a "habitual claimant" with [[Norwich Union]] after suffering "unfortunate" losses of private possessions.&lt;ref name=woolcock&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woolcock |first1=Nicola |title='Millionaire' quiz cheat guilty of insurance fraud |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445354/Millionaire-quiz-cheat-guilty-of-insurance-fraud.html |accessdate=2018-09-12 |work=Daily Telegraph (UK) |date=2003-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Parker]], prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to [[Zurich Insurance Group|Zurich]] in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. "He has been ineluctably dishonest," Mr Parker said. "He went to Direct Line and didn't make a disclosure about his claims history because he knew he wouldn't have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000." Staff at Direct Line were already "suspicious" about Ingram's £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on the game show.&lt;ref name=woolcock/&gt;

Ingram was given a [[conditional discharge]] on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance. The judge told Ingram he took into account "the punishment you have brought upon yourself and your dire financial state", and he rejected an alternative option of a [[community service]] order after Ingram told a [[probation officer]] he feared other criminals would bully him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Savill |first1=Richard |title=Cheating major walks free over insurance fraud |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1447382/Cheating-major-walks-free-over-insurance-fraud.html |accessdate=2018-09-12 |work=Daily Telegraph (UK) |date=2003-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Child's Play''''' (also called '''''Chucky''''') is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] centered on a series of seven films created by [[Don Mancini]]. The films mainly focus on [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]), a notorious [[serial killer]] known as the "Lakeshore Strangler" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to [[Hell]]. The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.

The film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child’s Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since ''Bride of Chucky'', titles have no longer been released under the ''Child's Play'' brand name and now use ''Chucky'' and will continue to do so with future films.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/24/new-childs-play-sequel-curse-of-chucky-coming-to-dvd|title=New Child's Play sequel, Curse of Chucky, Coming to DVD|publisher=IGN|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' program as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taunting wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] who was a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] at the time and promoting ''Bride of Chucky''.

The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. As time goes on Chucky has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus has to possess the first person he told his secret to - Andy.

Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now dead Tiffany and attacks a detective.

Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own.

===''Curse of Chucky'' (2013)===
{{Main|Curse of Chucky}}

Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's body which will be explained in Cult of Chucky, as he does the soul ritual the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying.

Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of ''[[Polaroid (film)|Polaroid]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' fame, respectively). David Katzenberg and [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] will serve as producers.

==Future==
====Potential sequels====
In October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from ''Cult of Chucky''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailydead.com/interview-don-mancini-talks-cult-of-chucky-and-the-enduring-controversy-of-seed-of-chucky/|title=Interview: Don Mancini Talks CULT OF CHUCKY and the Enduring Controversy of SEED OF CHUCKY - Daily Dead|date=October 5, 2017|website=Dailydead.com|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, it was announced that a ''Child's Play'' television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/921339-childs-play-tv-series-coming-from-don-mancini-david-kirschner/amp|title=Child's Play TV series coming - Coming Soon|date=February 9, 2018|website=Coming soon.net|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' Mancini discussed the potential of a ''Child's Play'' film set on a train&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as ''Chucky on the Orient Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], tentatively referred to as ''Child’s Play on Elm Street''.&lt;ref name=bloody-disgusting.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3319172/childs-play-train-freddy-vs-chucky-don-mancini-dreams/|author=Brad Miska|title=‘Child’s Play’ On a Train? Freddy Vs. Chucky? Don Mancini Dreams…|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act," he explains. "I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up?&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as "cool and doable", confirming that the film would be titled ''Child’s Play on Elm Street'' and that he was currently in discussion with [[New Line Cinema]] about the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1693069/child-plays-writer-has-the-best-idea-for-a-chucky-crossover-with-freddy-krueger|title=Child Play's Writer Has The Best Idea For A Chucky Crossover With Freddy Krueger|date=17 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'', in which [[Freddy Krueger]]'s [[Freddy Krueger#Bladed Glove|bladed glove]] had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-chucky|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Chucky|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|date=26 October 2017|website=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV Series===
In February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled ''Child's Play: The TV Series'', is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"/&gt; By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray.&lt;ref name="TVSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3505915/don-mancini-teases-childs-play-tv-series-coming-soon|title=Don Mancini Teases "Child’s Play: The TV Series," Coming Soon!|first=John|last=Squires|date=22 June 2018|website=Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky / Charles Lee Ray]]''' (played by [[Brad Dourif]])&lt;br&gt;The primary character in the fourth and fifth films and antagonist of the series. A merciless, wisecracking murderer whose soul gets stuck in a doll. He usually kills 'anyone' who gets in his way with a knife or any other weapon he finds and frames the hero of each film for them. Although being a deranged killer, he has a twisted sense of humor and often spouts comically vulgar insults. He is the only character to appear in all of the films in the franchise and appears in his human body in the first and, in the sixth movie, by flashbacks.
* '''[[Andy Barclay|Andrew William "Andy" Barclay]]''' (played by [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] and [[Justin Whalin]]) &lt;br&gt; The original protagonist. Pursued by Chucky so he could transfer his soul into the boy's body, but Andy always prevents Chucky from taking over his body, as well as successfully framing him for the murders. He appears in all three installments of the Child's Play trilogy and the sixth and seventh Chucky films. He is indirectly mentioned in ''Bride'' and ''Seed''.
*'''Karen Barclay''' (played by [[Catherine Hicks]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's mother, and later Mike's wife. She buys him a Good Guy doll for his birthday, unaware that the one she picked was possessed by a serial killer. Initially, she refuses to believe that Chucky was alive, but she soon finds out when he comes alive and tries to kill her. In ''Child's Play 2'', she is written out of the story when she was taken away to an insane asylum when no one believes her about the murderous doll. She appears only in the first film and is mentioned in the second, third and sixth films. In the sixth film, Karen talks to Andy over the phone, which reveals that she is now free from the asylum and plans to cook dinner for Andy's upcoming birthday. It is also strongly hinted that she has married Mike.
*'''Detective Mike Norris''' (played by [[Chris Sarandon]])&lt;br&gt;A detective investigating the murder of Andy's babysitter. He is also responsible for Chucky's death prompting him to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll. He initially refuses to believe the Barclays, but when Chucky tries to kill him, he becomes an ally to the family. In ''Child’s Play 2'', however, it is mildly implied that both Mike and Jack denied the ordeal to protect the reputation of the Chicago police department. Appears only in the first film, and is indirectly mentioned in the second and fourth films. He appears via archive footage in ''Curse of Chucky'' (namely, pictures on the internet). He was originally set to appear in ''Seed of Chucky'' but didn’t return due to scheduling conflicts.
*'''Kyle''' (played by [[Christine Elise]]) &lt;br&gt; Andy's teenage foster sister whom he ends up staying with. At first, she finds Andy to be a pain on her side but starts to back up his story about Chucky when she witnesses him trying to take his soul and later finds their foster mother murdered by Chucky. She then goes to find Andy and ends up saving his life in the Play Pals factory, as well as helping him destroy Chucky after he tries to kill him after the voodoo soul transfer spell goes awry. She appears in the second film and was written out of the series and was never seen again but was briefly mentioned in the third film when Andy re-encounters Chucky again. She was also briefly mentioned to have kept in contact with Andy in ''Curse'' as he kept a photo of her. Kyle later returned in ''Cult'' in the post-credits scene where actress [[Christine Elise]] reprised her role.
*'''Mr. Sullivan''' (played by [[Peter Haskell]])&lt;br&gt;The greedy and arrogant CEO of Good Guy Toys Inc., First appears in ''Child's Play 2'' upon learning of Andy's Good Guy Doll supposedly becoming possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, and tries to protect the company's reputation from angry stockholders. He also appears in ''Child’s Play 3'' when he moves Good Guy Toys forward with producing more dolls, however, he is killed by Chucky when he accesses Sullivan's office computer to find Andy in Military School. 
*'''Ronald Tyler''' (played by Jeremy Sylvers)&lt;br&gt;A young private boy who befriends Andy at the military school he is sent to after failing to cope with living at several foster homes. When he finds Chucky (who mailed himself to the same military school to go after Andy again), he decides to go after Tyler instead. At first, Tyler finds Chucky to be a nice guy but realizes the true colours of the doll's evil murderous ways once he attempts to transfer his soul into his body much like he attempted to do with Andy in the first two films. Appears in the third film, only to be written out of the series but was originally going to be killed off alongside Andy in the original draft to ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Kristen De Silva''' (played by [[Perrey Reeves]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's girlfriend at the military school he attends, ends up sticking up for him when Shelton and the other guys take a liking in bullying him. Appears only in the third film.
*'''Jack Santos''' (played by Tommy Swerdlow)&lt;br&gt;Mike's partner who was also investigating Andy's babysitter's death. In the beginning of the first film, he was mostly the cop who drove Mike's car to chase Eddie Caputo in his van. He was also one of the police officers that believed Andy was the killer. During the end, he tried to show Mike that Chucky wasn't alive, but was nearly killed by him and then he believed that the Barclays and Mike were telling the truth. He only appeared in the first film.
*'''[[Tiffany Valentine]]''' (played by [[Jennifer Tilly]])&lt;br&gt;Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend (and later wife/partner) who later gets her soul stuck in a doll like Chucky. She ultimately transfers her soul into actress Jennifer Tilly (her doppelganger and portrayer) in ''Seed'' after being fed up with her husband's intent to remain a doll. In ''Curse'', she is shown to be living a double life as both her regular self and Tilly. Appears in ''Bride'', ''Seed'', ''Curse'' and ''Cult''. 
*'''[[Jennifer Tilly]]''' (played by herself)&lt;br&gt;An exaggerated version of Tilly, herself, and Tiffany's idol. She first appears in ''Bride'' under her role as Tiffany. Appears in ''Seed'' as herself and the voice of Tiffany. Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Tilly's body. Also appears in Curse and Cult.
*'''[[Glen]]''' (played by [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and human form portrayed by Beans Balawi)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's original child and Glenda's twin brother. He was an orphan for the first five or six years of his life until he saw his parents on television. Glen is a good person, and he doesn't like violence and definitely does not like murder unlike his parents. Though Tiffany promised him that they will refrain from killing, Chucky tries to get Glen involved in the family business. He fears but still loves his dad due to the fact he killed him in a misunderstanding. He is the only living doll character not to be voiced by an [[Academy Award]] nominee. Appears in ''Bride'' (at the end as an infant) and ''Seed''. He does not appear in ''Curse'', nor is there any mention of him. 
*'''Glenda Ray''' (human form played by Kristina Hewitt)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's second child and the twin sister of Glen. She was originally Glen's alter ego for a brief moment, but was reborn as a human. Unlike Glen, she is violent, sadistic, and cruel. She is even more ruthless than her father, implying she possibly will take on the family business. Appears in ''Seed''.
*'''Jesse Miller''' (played by [[Nick Stabile]])&lt;br&gt;The former friend of Tiffany Ray and boyfriend of Jade. He was greatly disliked by Jade's uncle and believed to be responsible for his death until Chucky and Tiffany reveal themselves. In the end, Jade kills Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. He also appears in a ''Chucky'' comic continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Jade Kincaid''' (played by [[Katherine Heigl]])&lt;br&gt;The girlfriend of Jesse. Her uncle Warren is killed by Chucky and Tiffany early in the film. In the end, Jade shoots Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. She also appears with Jesse in another struggle with Chucky in a comic book continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.

==Controversies==

The following crimes have been associated with the ''Child’s Play'' films:

In December 1992 four people who [[Murder of Suzanne Capper#Torture|tortured and killed]] 16-year-old  Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the ''Child's Play'' movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (''Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)'' by 150 Volts, featuring [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from the movie ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadistic Killers: Profiles of pathological predators|first=Carol Anne|last=Davis|year=2007|publisher=Summersdale Publishing|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1-84024-581-3|authorlink=Carol Anne Davis|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] were said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]''. The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor [[James Ferman]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2605543.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Film censor Ferman dies|date=December 25, 2002|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including ''Chucky'' films, from the age of about six or seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/8235661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Boys' mother 'fed them cannabis'|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cleaners (serial killers)|Elena Lobacheva]], a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film ''Bride of Chucky'', which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-serial-killer-elena-lobacheva-bride-chucky-sexual-pleasure-killing-jailed-a8022326.html|title = ''Bride of Chucky'' serial killer who derived sexual pleasure from killing jailed|last = McIntyre|first = Niamh|publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''|date = 26 October 2017|website = independent.co.uk|accessdate = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==

===Innovation Publishing===
Beginning in 1992, [[Innovation Publishing]] released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 2''. It was later collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled ''Child’s Play: The Series'', ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 3''.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
In 2007, [[Devil's Due Publishing]] obtained the license to publish ''Child's Play'' comics and released a one-shot crossover with [[Hack/Slash]] titled ''Hack/Slash vs. Chucky'' which takes place after the events of the ''Seed of Chucky'' film. This was followed by a four-issue series called ''Chucky''. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.

==Video game==
{{main|Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash}}
Slimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''. The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet ''Child’s Play'' video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.

In the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child’s Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app was released on November 1, 2013.

==Halloween Horror Nights==
Since 1992, [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.

In 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''. ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.

In 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains [[Leatherface]], [[Freddy Krueger]], and [[Jason Voorhees]].

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==
[[File:Circassian woman.jpg|thumb|Circassian woman, date unknown]]
[[File:Bella Kukan.jpg|thumb|Bella Kukan, "Miss Circassia," 2013]]
An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989. [http://johncolarusso.net/pdf/Prometheus_among_the_Circassians.pdf  "Prometheus among the Circassians"]. In ''The World &amp; I''. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colarusso |first=John |date=March 1989 |title=Prometheus among the Circassians: A modern oral tale from a little known people of the Caucasus shows striking parallels with myths from Ancient Greece, Ancient India and the pagan Germanic world |magazine=[[World and I]] |publisher=[[The Washington Times|Washington Times Publishing Corporation]] |volume= |issue= |pages=644–651 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There are not any people, on the old continent, perfectly fair, except those who live in high latitudes, where the westerly winds come from the sea, at no great distance, so tempered as not to be very sharp nor very dry. This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others|sign=Voltaire|source=On Inoculation}}

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

{{further information|Circus clown}}

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===

The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

The '''comedy of manners''' is a form of [[comedy]] that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through [[stock characters]] such as the ''[[miles gloriosus]]'' ("boastful soldier") in [[ancient Greek comedy]] or the [[fop]] and [[rake (character)|rake]] of English [[Restoration comedy]], which is sometimes used as a synonym for "comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), which satirized the [[Victorian morality]] of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.

The comedy of manners was first developed in the [[New Comedy]] period of [[ancient Greek comedy]] and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright [[Menander]]. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|ancient Roman playwrights]], such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the [[Renaissance]]. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright [[Molière]], who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' in plays such as ''[[L'École des femmes]]'' ([''The School for Wives''], 1662), ''[[Tartuffe]]'' ([''The Imposter''], 1664), and ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' ([''The Misanthrope''], 1666).

== Early examples ==
The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. [[Horace]]'s [[Satires (Horace)|Satire 1.9]] is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' might be considered the first comedy of manners In [[England]], but the genre really flourished during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. [[Restoration comedy]], which was influenced by [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[comedy of humours]], made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time.  The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of [[William Wycherley]] (''[[The Country Wife]]'', 1675) and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] (''[[The Way of the World]]'', 1700). In the late 18th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', 1773) and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (''[[The Rivals]]'', 1775; ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', 1777) revived the form.

The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists [[Noël Coward]] (''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', 1925) and [[Somerset Maugham]] and the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], as well as various [[British sitcom]]s.  The ''[[Carry On film]]s'' are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners 
style.

== Twentieth-century examples ==

The term ''[[comedy of menace]]'', which British drama critic [[Irving Wardle]] based on the subtitle of ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'' (1958), by [[David Campton]], is a jocular play-on-words derived from the "comedy of manners" (''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent).&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Susan Hollis Merritt, ''Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter'' (Durham &amp; London, 1990: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinter's play ''[[The Homecoming]]'' has been described as a mid-twentieth-century "comedy of manners".&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' (1999), [[David Mamet]] chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme).  Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class.  Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.

Other contemporary examples include [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Room with a View]]'', [[Barbara Pym]]'s ''[[Excellent Women]]'', [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s ''[[As Bees in Honey Drown]]'', ''[[The Country Club (play)|The Country Club]]'', ''[[The Little Dog Laughed (play)|The Little Dog Laughed]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'' by [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and [[Jimmy Perry]], and the [[Jeeves|Jeeves and Wooster]] series by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. The television program ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.

[[Image:Crusty Demons.jpg|thumb|300px|Crusty Demons Regional Australia Tour in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], [[Australia]]]]
The '''Crusty Demons''' are a group of [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] freestyle motorcyclists from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. They originated in 1994 with the filming of ''Crusty Demons of Dirt'' by Fleshwound Films. Since then, they have been the subject of about 20 videos, and in 2007 the video game ''Crusty Demons'' was released to the public. Together the members of Crusty Demons have set 11 world records in their careers.

== Background ==
The origins of the group can be traced to 1994, when filmmakers Jon Freeman and Dana Nicholson had been accumulating footage to showcase a behind the scenes expose of the lifestyle of an American pro motocross rider in action, featuring 145&amp;nbsp;ft plus jumps, 45&amp;nbsp;ft high in the air soaring over sand dunes, mountains, houses, buses and anything else secure and steep enough to hold the weight of bike and rider. The end result was Fleshwound Films and the first video "Crusty Demons of Dirt".

Following the success of the first film, Crusty 2 premiered 18 months later. Sales exceeded expectations and tripled from the first video as the Crusty phenomenon began spreading worldwide. What was somewhat a stagnant sport had received a positive injection of interest and proved its worthiness of being showcased Internationally. People began buying the clothing worn by their heroes (Fleshgear) and thousands around the world were getting bikes and heading for the racetrack, mountains, sand dunes and the sky. With a unique production style the Crusty Demons filmed created a whole new genre of Action Sports Films. With cutting-edge editing by Director of Photography Scotty Avalos, they quickly gained a following and the hardcore fans were born.

With the release of Crusty 3 in 1997 and the videos and sport rising in popularity, freestyle motocross pioneer Lofty (a.k.a. Brian Jordan) went to Fleshwound Films with the idea of staging a freestyle motocross competition. Four months later the first competition was held in Las Vegas. This new side of the sport was looked down upon by the industry and many people said it would go nowhere, but the excitement amongst the fans indicated otherwise.

Fleshwound Films undoubtedly played a crucial part in the evolution of the sport, they are still shooting Crusty Films today and recently released the 10th installment titled "Crusty X – A Decade of Dirt". Apart from videos, Fleshwound also made a great success out of Fleshwound Film merchandise, which inspired their creation of the official Crusty clothing brand, Flesh gear (a freestyle ride gear and lifestyle clothing).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

The {{Nihongo|'''''Dotch Cooking Show'''''|どっちの料理ショー|Dotchi no Ryōri Shō|lead=yes}} (April 17, 1997 – March 17, 2005) was a [[Japan]]ese [[cooking show]] produced by the [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation]] and known for its use of the highest quality and most expensive food ingredients available from both domestic and international sources. In the show two chefs prepare two competing dishes, each using a special premium ingredient, but the dish that is ultimately served at the end of the show is determined by majority vote of the panelists, and then served only to those who voted for that dish. The show is continued by the {{Nihongo|[[#The New Dotch Cooking Show|'''''New Dotch Cooking Show''''']]|新どっちの料理ショー|Shin Dotchi no Ryōri Shō}} from April 14, 2005.

==Format==
Each of the two hosts, [[Hiroshi Sekiguchi]] (関口宏) and [[Yuji Miyake]] (三宅裕司), chooses a particular dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef.  For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi was in charge of the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen.  In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw.  The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical "battle" would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen.  Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus fruit tart, and even tacos versus spring rolls.

The seven guests would be asked to choose which meal they would most like to eat.  Unlike [[Iron Chef]], where the judges would get to eat the food prepared by both chefs, only the guests who chose the winning dish were allowed to eat.  There were three periods when the guests would vote; the first was when the dishes were announced, the second was after the "tasting time," and the third was after both dishes had been completed.  Though Sekiguchi and Miyake would be allowed to taste the dishes in progress and describe what they had eaten (often in dramatic fashion), the guests were allowed only one "tasting time," where they got a sample of each kitchen's special ingredient, usually prepared in a manner similar to how it would be for the finished product.  In the later episodes of the show, the tasting time was eliminated for all but one of the guests. The lucky guest, who was randomly chosen, would be allowed the samples as previously described, and would then have to describe what they tasted to the other guests.  As a result, they would be the only one asked to choose the dish they wanted during the second voting.  This was done to increase the suspense for the TV audience and put the guests on the same level as the audience.

While the chefs were preparing their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests to vote for their respective dishes.  The special ingredients could be anything from the focus of the recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component.  Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland.  In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone-cooked [[bibimbap]], or a special cast iron press used to make [[taiyaki]].  Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced.

At the end of the show, the two hosts would declare in unison: "{{Nihongo|''Kon'ya no gochūmon wa dotch?''|今夜の御注文はどっち？||Which dish will you order for tonight?}}" The word "{{Nihongo|''Dotch''|どっち|Dotchi}}", which appears in the show's graphics, is a transliteration of the Japanese word meaning "which one". The guests would press a button (corresponding to which dish they chose) and the side with the most votes was declared the winner.  The winning host would then ask the loser to withdraw (''tesshū'', 撤收).  The losing host and his chef would then take away their losing dish, and the winning guests and host would then dine on their selection.  The hungry losers would watch the winners eat.  This would often be followed by a scene of the winning host and guests leaving the show set satisfied after their meal, a scene of the losing host and guests griping about not getting to eat as they left the studio, or sometimes both.   At the very end of the show, the losing chef would typically be shown eating his dish alone, wondering why he did not win.

Since each side had to prepare food for eight people (seven guests and the winning host, in the event of a complete 7-0 victory (later 9 portions for seven guests, the winning host, and the assistant for the winning kitchen) and typically fewer than that number would actually get to eat, any food left over after the winners had eaten was usually consumed by the show's crew.  Since each show usually took hours to film, the hunger expressed by the losing guests at the end was genuine.

The assistants reported, newscaster-style, on the obtaining of special ingredients.  The chefs were hired from a pool of highly skilled cooks.

==The New Dotch Cooking Show==
The format of the show is basically the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress).  The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called "Hara-Helicopters," drawn from a pool.  Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, "idols," "young men who have not eaten for 48 hours," or restaurateurs.  During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage.  In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they could smell it.  The series went on hiatus on September 14, 2006
and returned on January 4, 2007 for a one-time only TV special.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how '''sexual content in the media''' influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape.  Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itfacts.biz/?id=p7960|website=IT Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.

==Types of Sexual Content==

Scholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or [[humiliation]]. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=205|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Sexual Content in the Media==

===[[Arousal]]===

One crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, "the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=307|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mallamuth|first1=Nell|title=Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil_Malamuth/publication/227585245_Sexually_Explicit_Media_Gender_Differences_and_Evolutionary_Theory/links/00b7d5217c318d0d1d000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to "normal" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than "normal" men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lohr|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Adams|first2=Henry E.|last3=Davis|first3=J. Mark|title=Sexual arousal to erotic and aggressive stimuli in sexually coercive and noncoercive men.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1997|volume=106|issue=2|pages=230–242|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.106.2.230|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=1997-03909-007&amp;S=L&amp;D=pdh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLe80SeprA4y9fwOLCmr0%2BeqK9Sr6i4SraWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGqs1Gyr7NJuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carnes|first1=Patrick J.|title=Cybersex, Courtship, and Escalating Arousal: Factors in Addictive Sexual Desire|journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity|date=13 October 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=45–78|doi=10.1080/10720160127560|url=https://www.iitap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ARTICLECybersex-Courtship-Escalating-Arousal_PCarnes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.

=== Attitudinal Effects ===

One of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utility, Probability, and Human Decision Making Selected Proceedings of an Interdisciplinary Research Conference, Rome, 3-6 September, 1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=9789401018364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ZILLMANN|first1=DOLF|last2=BRYANT|first2=JENNINGS|title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography on Family Values|journal=Journal of Family Issues|date=December 1988|volume=9|issue=4|pages=518–544|doi=10.1177/019251388009004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zillmann|first1=Dolf|last2=Bryant|first2=Jennings|title=Pornography's Impact on Sexual Satisfaction1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=April 1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=438–453|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00027.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|last2=Smith|title=Daytime talk shows: Up close and in your face. Sexual teens, sexual media|pages=79–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual Differences ===

Different people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettleman|title=XXX=$$$|journal=Manhattan Mercury|date=1999|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=Charlene Y.|last2=Desmarais|first2=Serge|title=Impact of Interaction With a Partner or Friend on the Exposure Effects of Pornography and Erotica|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 December 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=645–658|doi=10.1891/vivi.19.6.645.66347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Debra M.|last2=Strassberg|first2=Donald S.|last3=Turner|first3=Charles W.|title=Gender effects of romantic themes in erotica|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=February 1995|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–35|doi=10.1007/BF01541986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosher|first1=Donald L.|last2=MacIan|first2=Paula|title=College men and women respond to X‐rated videos intended for male or female audiences: Gender and sexual scripts|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=January 1994|volume=31|issue=2|pages=99–113|doi=10.1080/00224499409551736}}&lt;/ref&gt; while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it.  Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.

Personality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushman|first1=Brad J.|last2=Bonacci|first2=Angelica M.|last3=van Dijk|first3=Mirjam|last4=Baumeister|first4=Roy F.|title=Narcissism, sexual refusal, and aggression: Testing a narcissistic reactance model of sexual coercion.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1027–1040|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaert|first1=Anthony F.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=2001|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–53|doi=10.1023/A:1026416723291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Effects ===

Bryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.

==== [[Catharsis]] ====

Catharsis holds that "vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Jennings|last2=Zillmann|first2=Dolf|title=Violence and Sex in the Media|volume=An integrated approach to communication theory and research|pages=195–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;" This popular idea comes directly from [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic models of personality]]. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langevin|first1=Ron|last2=Lang|first2=Reuben A.|last3=Wright|first3=Percy|last4=Handy|first4=Lorraine|last5=Frenzel|first5=Roy R.|last6=Black|first6=Edward L.|title=Pornography and sexual offences|journal=Annals of Sex Research|date=1988|volume=1|issue=3|pages=335–362|doi=10.1007/BF00878103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CARTER|first1=DANIEL LEE|last2=PRENTKY|first2=ROBERT ALAN|last3=KNIGHT|first3=RAYMOND A.|last4=VANDERVEER|first4=PENNY L.|last5=BOUCHER|first5=RICHARD J.|title=Use of Pornography in the Criminal and Developmental Histories of Sexual Offenders|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=June 1987|volume=2|issue=2|pages=196–211|doi=10.1177/088626087002002005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few empirical studies support the [[catharsis]] effect.

==== [[Disinhibition]] ====
Disinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Leonard|title=Some determinants of impulsive aggression: Role of mediated associations with reinforcements for aggression.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1974|volume=81|issue=2|pages=165–176|doi=10.1037/h0036094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donnerstein|first1=Edward|title=Aggressive erotica and violence against women.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1980|volume=39|issue=2|pages=269–277|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.2.269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imitation ====
Imitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that "humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|date=August 2001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.

==== Desensitization ====
The desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.

'''Frank Farian''' (born '''Franz Reuther''' 18 July 1941, [[Kirn]], [[Germany]]) is a German [[record producer]] and [[songwriter]], best known as the founder and voice behind the 1970s' [[disco]]-pop group [[Boney M.]] and as the mastermind and voice behind the lip-syncing group [[Milli Vanilli]]. His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.

==Career==
Farian started as a trained cook before moving into the [[music industry]]. In April 1967, he released "[[Will You Ever Be Mine]]" under the name "Frankie Farian".

===Boney M.=== 
In the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song "[[Baby Do You Wanna Bump]]" (a remake of [[Prince Buster]]'s song "Al Capone" from 1967), released under the pseudonym [[Boney M.]], became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with "[[Was kann schöner sein]]", a German version of "When You've Gotta Go" originally by [[Solomon King]], co-written by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Ron Roker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-543979 |title=Offizielle Deutsche Charts - Offizielle Deutsche Charts |website=Offiziellecharts.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shying away from the spotlight, he  hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, [[Marcia Barrett]] and [[Liz Mitchell]], who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, [[Bobby Farrell]], was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Far Corporation===
Farian also started the [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] [[Far Corporation]] (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured [[Steve Lukather]], [[David Paich]], [[Bobby Kimball]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], and [[Robin McAuley]], many of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to [[record chart|chart]] with a [[cover version]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", becoming a [[Top 40|top 10]] [[Hit record|hit]] in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], reaching number 8 in October 1985.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

===Meat Loaf===
In 1986, Farian produced and mixed the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album "[[Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries]]", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring [[John Parr]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 2"&gt;{{cite book

===Milli Vanilli===
In 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the [[Milli Vanilli]] scandal, a musical equivalent of [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]]. As a producer, he had assembled a group from [[session musician]]s, fronting it with visually attractive dancers [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]]. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the [[Gramophone record|records]].&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book

===Later activity===
Some other groups that Farian has been involved with are [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]] (he became a manager in 1977) and [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]].

On 15 August 2006, the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool]]'' opened at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The line-up included [[Michelle Collins]], [[Michael Harvey (musician)|Michael Harvey]], [[Javine Hylton]], and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, [[Germany]] and the show also toured in the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daddycoolmusical.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519131138/http://www.daddycoolmusical.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-19|title=Daddy Cool Musical|website=Daddycoolmusical.com|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; from August 2011 to February 2012, [[Spain]] ([[Palma de Mallorca]]) in July 2012, [[Switzerland]] from, November 2015 to January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool |title=DADDY COOL - das Musical mit den Welthits von Boney M. im Le Théâtre Kriens-Luzern |website=Le-theatre.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404071429/http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool/ |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |title=Daddy Cool Das Boney M Musical - Frank Serr Showservice Int. e.K |website=Showservice-international.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205023651/http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |archive-date=5 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#"Doin' Fine"|Doin' Fine]]", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, [[Peter Wilson (musician)|Peter Wilson]], Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string [[arrangement]] from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604231424/http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com/ |date=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled "Daddy's Cool 12" Mix", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/index.html |title=Euro Dance Hits : Site News |publisher=Eurodancehits.com |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of "Doin' Fine" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, ''Follow Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015201113/http://klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Klone Records! |publisher=Klone Records! |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by [[Amanda Lear]].

Other acts he collaborated with include [[Gilla (singer)|Gilla]], [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]], [[La Mama (band)|La Mama]], [[Precious Wilson]], [[Gift]] and [[Daniel Lopes]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In contrast with mainstream American comics, [[webcomics]] are primarily written and drawn by [[women]] and [[gender variant]] people. Because of the [[self-published]] nature of [[webcomics]], the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) expression.

==Statistics==
A 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and [[non-binary]] comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as [[comic books]] are [[gatekeeper|gatekept]] by [[cisgender]] men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.&lt;ref name=Graph /&gt;

According to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/786/610/RUG01-001786610_2012_0001_AC.pdf|publisher=[[Universiteit Gent]]|title="Man, you split wood like a girl."

==Women in webcomics==
[[File:Rachita_Taneja_-_Sanity_Panels_-_Respect_Women.png|thumb|left|Rachita Taneja's ''[[Sanitary Panels]]'' discusses sexism and [[misogyny]] in India.&lt;ref name=India /&gt;|alt=A two-panel stick-figure strip. The one character says that they are tired of hearing the sentence "We need to respect women because they are our daughters, sisters, and mothers," and wants to hear "We need to respect women because they are people" instead.]]

''[[Girls with Slingshots]]'' creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. [[Noelle Stevenson]], creator of ''[[Nimona]]'' and ''[[Lumberjanes]]'', noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to "balance out" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered [[sexism]] during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with [[Reddit]] and [[4Chan]], websites outside of her usual channels.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44528|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Women in Comics: Stevenson &amp; Corsetto on Webcomics and the Future|last=Campbell|first=Josie|date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' pointed out in 2016 that there exists a growing community of [[black women]] cartoonists creating webcomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/agents-realm-mfk-and-ascent-black-women-webcomics-232493|publisher=''[[The A.V.

In India, where [[Rape in India|rape of women has been a big issue]] in the 2010s, [[Indian webcomics]] formed a platform for artists to poke fun at [[patriarchy]], [[feminism]], and various other gender-related topics. According to [[human rights activist]] and webcomic creator [[Rachita Taneja]], humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/buzz/stick-figure-activism-this-highly-vocal-webcomic-that-you-need-to-go-through-today-1210134.html|publisher=''[[IBN Live]]''|title=Stick-figure activism: A clever webcomic that talks about everything that's wrong with our country|last=Sanyal|first=Pathikrit|date=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/a-new-superhero-has-emerged-the-web-comic/story-jYYfrJYwj9D0yJOnHvOPJN.html|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|title=A new superhero has emerged, the web comic|last=Choksi|first=Nidhi|date=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girlamatic]] was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by [[Joey Manley]] in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including [[Shaenon Garrity]] and [[Lea Hernandez]]. The syndicate had won various [[List of Lulu Award winners|Lulu awards]] for being among the "most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/lulu-awards/|publisher=''[[Friends of Lulu]]''|title=Lulu Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Comixpedia'', [[Eric Burns]] voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it ''less'' likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|publisher=''Comixpedia''|title=Feeding Snarky|last=Burns|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Burns|date=2005-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419052623/http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|archive-date=2005-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT in webcomics==

==Gameplay==
All of the games are played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective, and the player must move around the massive battleground (using the [[analog stick]]s and buttons on the two gun controllers), while using the [[Light gun|Gun Controllers]] to aim and shoot at enemies. The goal is to survive and shoot down the rival [[Team deathmatch|team]] to decrease the opposing team's team meter within a given time limit. The round ends when either teams' team meter drops to zero and/or if the timer reaches zero.

Players can switch weapons in-battle, utilizing various strategies and tactics, by melding the two gun controllers together into different positions, such as:
*Side Style: by clipping the side of the gun controllers together, the players can use their character's secondary arsenal.
*Tandem Style: by clipping the tip of right gun controller onto the top of the left gun controller, the players can use their character's powerful arsenal.

As the players progressed to the game's multiplayer mode, those who using the [[NESiCAxLive]] card can accumulate "Team Points" by winning battles, and using it to purchase and equip "Weapon Packs". Weapons Packs are a set of weapons that can be purchased and use in battle. Some of the packs has upgraded versions of the character's default weapons with boosted stats.

==Plot==

===Setting===
In 2115, the country known formerly as [[Japan]] has been split into two [[Multiverse|parallel worlds]]: the {{nihongo|''Frontier S (Stratos)''|フロンティアS（ストラトス）|Furontia S (sutoratosu)}} and the {{nihongo|''17th Far East Imperial City Management District''|第十七極東帝都管理区|Dai jū nana Kyokutō no teikoku kanri-ku}}. Frontier S is an outlaw universe in which freedom runs rampant, while the 17th Far East Imperial City Management District is a totalitarian universe completely bereft of freedom and is under constant surveillance. When the two universes are starting to fuse into one, the government of each worlds initiates the {{nihongo|''Operation Stratos''|オペレーション・ストラトス|Operēshon sutoratosu}}, a world-scale protocol wherein a handpicked group of [[gunslinger]]s, mercenaries, and special individuals, each from the two universes, will be sent in the year 2015 to alter the past by eliminating the other side until only one group survives, erasing a parallel universe in the process.

===Story===
The story revolves on a group of [[gunslinger]]s, each from the [[Multiverse|two universes]] who participate in Operation Stratos, particularly on a group of four childhood friends: Tohru Kazasumi, Kyōka Katagiri, Kyōma Katagiri, and Shizune Rindo, who all must confront their own flaws and differences when they battle their alternate selves in order to survive.

[[File:William Merritt Chase Keying up.jpg|thumb|''"Keying Up" – The Court Jester'' by [[William Merritt Chase]] ([[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]])]]
A '''jester''', '''court jester''', or '''fool''', was historically an entertainer during the [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] eras who was a member of the household of a nobleman or a [[monarch]] employed to entertain him and his guests. A jester was also an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. Jesters are also modern-day entertainers who resemble their historical counterparts.

Jesters in medieval times are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and [[Cap and bells|eccentric hats]] in a [[motley]] pattern and their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume. Jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills: principal among them were song, music, and [[storytelling]], but many also employed [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], telling [[jokes]], and [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]]. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style and many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences.

==Etymology==
The modern use of the English word ''jester'' did not come into use until the mid-16th century, during Tudor times.&lt;ref name=FJ&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutworth|first=John|title=Fools and Jesters at the English Court|year=1998|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7509-1773-3|pages=89–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modern term derives from the older form ''gestour'', or ''jestour'', originally from Anglo-Norman (French) meaning ''story-teller'' or ''[[minstrel]]''. Other earlier terms included ''fol'', ''disour'', and ''bourder''. These terms described entertainers who differed in their skills and performances but who all shared many similarities in their role as comedic performers for their audiences.&lt;ref name=FJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welsford|first=Enid|title=The Fool: His Social &amp; Literary History|year=1935|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jester|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=jester&amp;searchmode=none|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early jesters were popular in Ancient Egypt, and entertained Egyptian pharaohs. The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a tradition of professional jesters, called ''[[balatro]]nes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace|Hor]]. Sat. i. 2. 2. (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; Balatrones were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded. Jesters were popular with the Aztec people in the 14th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212748/fool|title=Jester|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English royal court jesters===

[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 013.jpg|right|thumb|''Queen Henrietta Maria with Sir Jeffrey Hudson'' by [[Van Dyck]]]]

Many [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] throughout English royal history employed entertainers and most had professional fools, sometimes called ''licensed fools''.  Entertainment included [[early music|music]], [[storytelling]], and [[physical comedy]]. It has also been suggested they performed [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]].

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of [[England]] employed a jester named [[William Sommers|Will Sommers]].

During the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England]], [[William Shakespeare]] wrote his plays and performed with his theatre company the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later called the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]). Clowns and jesters were featured in Shakespeare's plays, and the company's expert on jesting was [[Robert Armin]], author of the book ''Fooled upon Foole''. In Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Feste]] the jester is described as "wise enough to play the fool".

[[File:"The Court Jester" (4540421737).jpg|thumb|upright|A court jester, carrying a [[marotte]], selected for the [[Pageant of Empire]] in 1909]]
King [[James VI of Scotland]] employed a jester called [[Archibald Armstrong]]. During his lifetime Armstrong was given great honours at court. He was eventually thrown out of the King's employment when he over-reached and insulted too many influential people. Even after his disgrace, books telling of his jests were sold in London streets. He held some influence at court still in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and estates of land in [[Ireland]]. Charles later employed a jester called [[Jeffrey Hudson]] who was very popular and loyal. Jeffrey Hudson had the title of ''Royal [[Dwarfism|Dwarf]]'' because he was short of stature. One of his jests was to be presented hidden in a giant pie from which he would leap out. Hudson fought on the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]]. A third jester associated with Charles I was called [[Muckle John]].

==Political significance==
[[File:Laughing Fool.jpg|thumb|upright|Laughing jester, unknown [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist (possibly [[Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen]]), circa 1500]]

Scholar David Carlyon has cast doubt on the "daring political jester", calling historical tales "apocryphal", and concluding that "popular culture embraces a sentimental image of the clown; writers reproduce that sentimentality in the jester, and academics in the Trickster", but it "falters as analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carlyon |first=D. |year=2002 |title=The Trickster as Academic Comfort Food |journal=The Journal of American Culture |volume=25 |issue=1–2 |pages=14–18 |doi=10.1111/1542-734X.00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesters could also give bad news to the King that no one else would dare deliver. In 1340, when the French fleet was destroyed at the [[Battle of Sluys]] by the English. [[Phillippe VI]]'s jester told him the English sailors "don't even have the guts to jump into the water like our brave French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otto |first=Beatrice K |title=Fools Are Everywhere: The Court Jester Around the World |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2001 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of tradition===
After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] did not reinstate the tradition of the court jester, but he did greatly patronize the theatre and proto-[[music hall]] entertainments, especially favouring the work of [[Thomas Killigrew]]. Though Killigrew was not officially a jester, [[Samuel Pepys]] in his famous diary does call Killigrew "The King's fool and jester, with the power to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty" (12 February 1668). The last British nobles to keep jesters were the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]]'s family, the Bowes-Lyons.

In the 18th century, jesters had died out except in [[Russia]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]].  In [[France]] and [[Italy]], travelling groups of jesters performed plays featuring stylized characters in a form of theatre called the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. A version of this passed into [[United Kingdom|British]] [[folk tradition]] in the form of a [[puppet]] show, ''[[Punch and Judy]]''. In France the tradition of the court jester ended with the [[French Revolution]].

In 1968, the [[Canada Council]] awarded a $3,500 grant to Joachim Foikis of [[Vancouver]] "to revive the ancient and time-honoured tradition of town fool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/22907610/|date=May 14, 1968|title=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times|location=Corpus Christi, Texas|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://considerthis.onlinedemocracy.ca/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=345|title=Northumberland needs county jester to lighten up politics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928112959/http://considerthis.onlinedemocracy.ca/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=345|archivedate=Sep 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, the jester is still seen at medieval-style [[fair]]s and pageants.

In 2015, the town of [[Conwy]] in [[North Wales]] appointed [[Russel Erwood]] (aka [[Erwyd le Fol]]) as the official resident jester of the town and its people, a post that had been vacant since 1295.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/jester-700-years/story-27536385-detail/story.html|title=Welsh medieval town unveils first jester-in-residence for 700 years|date=2015-08-03|newspaper=South Wales Evening Post|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/welsh-town-appoints-official-jester-700-years-article-1.2316415|title=Welsh town appoints first official jester in 700 years|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/russel-erwood-town-jester-conwy-9814519|title=This official town jester can balance a flaming barbecue on his head..!|last=Day|first=Liz|date=2015-08-08|newspaper=walesonline|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], [[Till Eulenspiegel]] is a folkloric hero dating back to medieval times and ruling each year over [[Fasching]] or [[Carnival]] time,  mocking politicians and public figures of power and authority with [[political satire]] like a modern-day court jester. He holds a mirror to make us aware of our times ([[Zeitgeist]]), and his [[sceptre]], his "bauble"&lt;!--Do not link, as this redirects to Christmas tree ornament.--&gt; or [[marotte]], is the symbol of his power.

In 17th century [[Spain]], [[Dwarfism|little people]], often with deformities, were employed as buffoons to entertain the king and his family, especially the children. In [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s painting [[Las Meninas]] two dwarfs are included: Mari Bárbola a female dwarf from [[Germany]] with [[hydrocephalus]], and [[:es:Nicolasito Pertusato|Nicolasito Portusato]] from [[Italy]]. Mari Bárbola can also be seen in a later portrait of [[Margarita Teresa of Spain|princess Margarita Teresa]] in mourning by [[Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo]]. There are other paintings by Velázquez that include court dwarves such as [[Prince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf]].

In [[Japan]] from the 13th to 18th centuries, the ''[[taikomochi]]'', a kind of male [[geisha]], attended the feudal lords (''[[daimyō]]s''). They entertained mostly through dancing and storytelling, and were at times counted on for strategic advice. By the 16th century they fought alongside their lord in battle in addition to their other duties.

[[Tonga]] was the first royal court to appoint a court jester in the 20th century; [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]], the King of Tonga, appointed [[Jesse Bogdonoff|JD Bogdanoff]] to that role in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenoodlebowl.com/jesters/images/reality/jddecree.jpg |format=JPEG |title=Tonga royal decree appointing JD Bogdanoff as court jester |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdanoff was later embroiled in a financial scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3141297.stm |title=Tongan court jester faces trial |date=11 August 2003 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The jester as a symbol==
The root of the word "fool" is from the Latin ''follis'', which means "bag of wind" or bellows or that which contains air or breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fool|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fool in Tarot===
In [[Tarot cards|Tarot]], [[The Fool (Tarot card)|"The Fool"]] is a card of the [[Major Arcana]].  The tarot depiction of the Fool includes a man (or less often, a woman) [[juggling]] unconcernedly or otherwise distracted, often with a dog or cat at his heels.  The fool is in the act of unknowingly walking off the edge of a cliff, precipice or other high place. (compare: [[Joker (playing card)]]).

===Fool in literature===
In literature, the jester is symbolic of common sense and of honesty, notably in ''[[King Lear]]'', where the court jester is a character used for insight and advice on the part of the monarch, taking advantage of his license to mock and speak freely to dispense frank observations and highlight the folly of his monarch. This presents a clashing irony as a greater man could dispense the same advice and find himself being detained in the dungeons or even executed. Only as the lowliest member of the court can the jester be the monarch's most useful adviser.

Author [[Alan Gordon (author)|Alan Gordon]] also writes about jesters as advisers to the king, who actually make up a super-secret spy ring that try to keep peace and control the leaders of different countries. The Fool's Guild of these novels is portrayed as a mockery to the church, and they refer to [[Jesus Christ]] as "Their Savior, The First Fool".

===Shakespearean jesters===
{{Main|Shakespearean fool}}
The [[Shakespearean fool]] is a recurring character type in the works of [[William Shakespeare]].

Shakespearean fools are usually clever peasants or commoners that use their wits to outdo people of higher social standing. In this sense, they are very similar to the real [[fool (stock character)|fool]]s, and jesters of the time, but their characteristics are greatly heightened for theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81oZXMaib6IC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=gravediggers++hamlet#PPA17,M1 |title=The fools of Shakespeare: an ... - Frederick B. Warde - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "groundlings" (theatre-goers who were too poor to pay for seats and thus stood on the 'ground' in the front by the stage) that frequented the Globe Theatre were more likely to be drawn to these Shakespearean fools. However they were also favoured by the nobility.  Most notably, Queen Elizabeth I was a great admirer of the popular actor who portrayed fools, [[Richard Tarlton]].  For Shakespeare himself, however, actor [[Robert Armin]] may have proved vital to the cultivation of the fool character in his many plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foolsforhire.com/info/history.html |title=History of the Fool |publisher=Foolsforhire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[File:PuckCover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|American lawyer and politician [[Roscoe Conkling]] depicted as a jester in an 1884 cartoon.]]

===Buffoon===
In a similar vein, a '''buffoon''' is someone who provides amusement through inappropriate appearance or behavior.

Originally the term was used to describe a ridiculous but amusing person. The term is now frequently used in a derogatory sense to describe someone considered foolish, or someone displaying inappropriately vulgar, bumbling or ridiculous behavior that is a source of general amusement.

The term originates from the old Italian "buffare", meaning to puff out one's cheeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=780|title=Encyclopædia Britannica; or A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Volume 4|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|date=1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; that also applies to [[bouffon]].

===Carnival and medieval reenactment===
[[File:VSAN Wgt 2015 476 Markdorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Jester in [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]], Germany, in 2015]]

Today, the jester is portrayed in different formats of [[medieval reenactment]] and [[entertainment]], including [[film]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] performance, and [[carnival]]. During the Burgundian and the [[Rhenish]] [[carnival in the Netherlands|carnival]], cabaret performances in local dialect are held. In [[North Brabant|Brabant]] this person is called a "tonpraoter" or "sauwelaar", and is actually in or on a barrel. In [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] they are named "buuttereedner" or "buutteredner" and in [[Zeeland]] they are called an "ouwoer". They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from local and regional politics who are mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The "Tonpraoter" or "Buuttereedner" may be considered successors of the jesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Kalender Nieuws Zoekertjes Albums Copyright |url=http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval |title=Wat is carnaval? &amp;#124; Fen Vlaanderen |publisher=Fenvlaanderen.be |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being offered a superpowered item or ability to use in this new world, Kazuma, following some provocation, chooses Aqua herself to accompany him to the town of Axel, quickly finding her absent-mindedness to be less than beneficial.{{ref|LN|LN 1.P}} With Aqua unable to return to the afterlife until the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Devil King]] is defeated, the two form a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] and recruit two other members; an explosion-obsessed magician named Megumin and a masochistic crusader named Darkness.{{ref|LN|LN 1.2.4}} Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a luxurious lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life are forcing him and his party to encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.{{ref|LN|LN 2.3}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=''KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World'' is an anime that has a lot of fun mocking the tropes of the typical JRPG fantasy world via a colorful cast of characters that are enjoyable in their own right. The comedy is so spot-on with its deadpan nature that it's hard not to be drawn in by that alone.|source=– Richard Eisenbeis, in his review of the anime&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review" /&gt;}}

Like its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the "trapped in a fantasy world" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Reviewing the first few episodes, [[Anime News Network]] (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as "the funniest episode of anime I have seen since ''[[Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun]]'' aired", while also praising the series' musical score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episodes-1-2/.97800 |title=KonoSuba – God's blessing on this wonderful world!!

In every scene, his inflection and tone is exactly right to milk the maximum value out of a scene's comedy potential. ... The female seiyuu are nailing their roles too, but many scenes in this series wouldn't be half as funny without Kazuma's dry wit as the slightly-less-crazy center of a crazy maelstrom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as "low budget" as characters appeared [[off-model]].&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissy|first=Kim|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/02/27-1/feature-novel-vs-anime-konosuba|title=FEATURE: Novel vs Anime - "Konosuba"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to "bring out the individuality of each character" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed "their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments."&lt;ref name="Interview with Koichi Kikuta"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wavemotioncannon.com/2017/02/07/konosuba-interview-with-koichi-kikuta-anime-style-009-july-2016/|title=Konosuba Interview with Koichi Kikuta (Anime Style 009, July 2016)|work=Wave Motion Cannon|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crunchyroll]]'s Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; [[Kotaku]] writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|url=https://kotaku.com/when-your-new-life-in-a-jrpg-world-doesn-t-live-up-to-e-1778353269|title=When Your New Life in a JRPG World Doesn't Live Up to Expectations|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.&lt;ref name="Creamer review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Nick|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-episodes-1-10-streaming/.100209|title=KonoSuba – God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! [Episodes 1-10 Streaming]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 25, 2016|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''KonoSuba''{{'s}} characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a "strange but endearing chemistry," as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close.&lt;ref name="Creamer review" /&gt; Morrissy added the party's "emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair."&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite ''KonoSuba'' Character poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sneakerbunko.jp/special/konosuba-charavote/index.php|title=KonoSuba Character Poll|work=[[Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the sixth-highest vote in ''[[Newtype]]''{{'s}} 2015–16 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most "Other" votes in the Best Girl category in [[Crunchyroll]]'s Anime Awards 2016.&lt;ref name="Newtype 2015-16 Awards"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Scott|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/10/09/japanese-fans-pick-favorite-anime-from-last-twelve-months-in-newtype-awards|title=Japanese Fans Pick Favorite Anime From Last Twelve Months In Newtype Awards|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=October 9, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll Awards 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/01/10-1/feature-crunchyroll-anime-awards-the-results-are-in-see-who-won|title=FEATURE: Crunchyroll Anime Awards - The Results are In!

In 2016, the anime was voted the tenth-best TV anime in the ''Newtype'' 2015–16 Awards.&lt;ref name="Newtype 2015-16 Awards" /&gt; ''KonoSuba'' also finished runner-up for Best Comedy in the Anime Awards 2016 to ''[[Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto]]''.&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll Awards 2016" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1248">A '''lightning round''' is a round of a game or contest in which the duration of the round is a pre-determined length of time, and the goal is typically to accomplish as much as possible within that period. The most common format of a lightning round is in a question-and-answer game, to answer as many questions as possible within a given time limit. The term "lightning round" is usually reserved for a single round in a game whose normal gameplay is untimed. Lightning rounds are often used at [[quiz bowl]]s.

In television, a lightning round is usually accompanied by an indicator of the time remaining, and is commonly presented with some increase of intensity, such as a change of lighting, or sound effect (such as a ticking clock), or musical cue. The game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', while not the first to employ such a round, was the first to formally call it the "Lightning Round".

The term was also famously used in the ''[[Friends]]'' episode "The One With the Embryos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript of The One With the Embryos|url=http://friends.tktv.net/Episodes4/summaries/12.html|website=http://friends.tktv.net/|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22621">{{distinguish|MacGuffin (cipher)}}
In [[fiction]], a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''') is a [[plot device]] in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no [[narrative]] explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.

The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially [[Thriller film|thrillers]]. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first [[Act (theater)|act]], and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as '''plot coupons'''.&lt;ref name="ansible"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html |title=The Well-Tempered Plot Device |last=Lowe |first=Nick |authorlink=&lt;!-- not the comics writer (born 1979).

==History and use==
The use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name ''MacGuffin''.&lt;ref name=mward /&gt;  The [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian Legend]] has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=mward&gt;Dr. Marjory T. Ward, "King Arthur Revisited" in Dr. Andrew Keen (ed.) "Proceedings of the Second History/Literature Conference on Medieval Literature"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I]]–era actress [[Pearl White]] used ''weenie'' to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and the other [[Movie serial#Silent era|silent film serials]] in which she starred.&lt;ref name="Lahue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bound and Gagged: The Story of the Silent Serials |first=Kalton C. |last=Lahue |year=1968 |publisher=Oak Tree Pubs |isbn=978-0-498-06762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1929 detective novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', a small [[statuette]] provides both the book's [[eponymous]] title and its motive for intrigue.

The name ''MacGuffin'' was coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Colin|title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie: A British Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-86064-633-1|p=21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215809/https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the 1930s.

===Alfred Hitchcock===
The [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]] Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term ''MacGuffin'' and the technique with his 1935 film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', an early example of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall Deutelbaum |author2=Leland A. Poague |year=2009 |title=A Hitchcock reader |page=114 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digou|first=Mike|title=Hitchcock's Macguffin In The Works Of David Mamet|journal=Literature Film Quarterly|date=October 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' in a 1939 lecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interviewed in 1966 by [[François Truffaut]], Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' using the same story.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framing Hitchcock: Selected essays from the Hitchcock annual|publisher=Wayne State University Press Detroit|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|work=[[Google Books]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock also said, "The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=David |date=1995 |title=Perspectives on Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqZZAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=G. K. Hall |page=31 |isbn= 9780816116034 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's term ''MacGuffin'' helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface.  Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for [[Richard Schickel]]'s documentary ''The Men Who Made the Movies'', and in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cavettbiter|title=Alfred Hitchcock was confused by a laxative commercial|date=2007-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503122702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]], a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |title=Frequently asked questions on Hitchcock |author=Ken Mogg |work=labyrinth.net.au |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703212952/http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |archivedate=July 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lucas===
On the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]] describes [[R2-D2]] as "the main driving force of the movie&amp;nbsp;... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin&amp;nbsp;... the object of everybody's search".&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;''Star Wars'' (1977) Region 2 DVD release (2004). Audio commentary, 00:14:44 – 00:15:00.&lt;/ref&gt; In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object ''specifically'' is, he declared, "The audience don't care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |title=The 39 Steps – Film (Movie) Plot and Review |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193532/http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that "the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |title=Keys to the Kingdom |date=February 2008 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193209/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Lavandier===
For the filmmaker and drama writing theorist [[Yves Lavandier]], in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |title=Excerpts from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118203139/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |archivedate=January 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[North by Northwest]]''{{'}}s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''. In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |title=Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150601/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the mixed critical reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the primary criticism was that the [[crystal skull]] in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin.

The term gained its circulation in late 1980s, but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to 1960s with the proliferation of [[anime]] with its interconnection of media and commodity goods.&lt;ref name=amm&gt;Steinberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rzGqyHaUGYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22media+mix%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jKD4U4ryJZC3ogSxuYCwBw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22media%20mix%22&amp;f=false p. vi]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The penetration into the American market of the series such as ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]''&lt;ref name=jen/&gt; gave rise to the recognition of what is variously called [[transmedia storytelling]], [[crossmedia]], [[transmediation]], media synergy, etc.&lt;ref name=amm/&gt;

Researchers argue that the 1963 ''[[Tetsuwan Atomu]]'' marked a shift in Japanese marketing: from the focus on the content of the commodity to "overlapping the commodity image with the character image".&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt;

The book ''Anime's Media Mix: Franchising Toys and Characters in Japan'' by Marc Steinberg details the evolution of the media mix in Japan.

'''''Monsters, Inc.''''' is a [[CGI animated]] [[film series]] and [[Disney]] [[media franchise]] that began with the 2001 film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', produced by [[Pixar]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The original film was followed by a [[prequel]] film, ''[[Monsters University]]'', released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graser|first=Marc|title=Disney drawing 'Monsters Inc.' sequel|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018177|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film series==
===''Monsters, Inc.'' (2001)===
{{Main|Monsters, Inc.}}
The first film introduces the monster world, where monsters enter the human world at night and scare children in order to generate power. When a little girl accidentally enters the monster world, friends Mike and Sulley must find a way to hide her from the authorities and return her to her own world, and in the process learn that not everything they have been led to believe about humans is true. The film surpassed ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and peaked as the second [[highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]] of all time, behind only 1994's ''The Lion King'' at the time.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch201"&gt;Price, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first animated films to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] but lost to ''[[Shrek]]''.

===''Monsters University'' (2013)===
{{Main|Monsters University}}
A prequel to the first film, ''Monsters University'' tells Mike and Sulley's backstory. The future friends meet at college and initially do not get along, but end up on the same team in the university's "Scare Games", where they and their team of misfits must beat the odds and win the competition, or be expelled from school. As the team struggles, the two learn to work together, and slowly become best friends.

'''Narrative paradigm''' is a communication theory conceptualized by 20th-century communication scholar [[Walter Fisher (professor)|Walter Fisher]]. The paradigm claims that all meaningful [[communication]] occurs via [[storytelling]] or [[Narrative|reporting of events]]. Humans participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. This theory further claims that stories are more persuasive than arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/militaryveterangamer/2014/01/18/narrative-paradigm-3-key-concepts|title=Narrative Paradigm 3: Key Concepts - Blog by militaryveterangamer - IGN|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://communicationtheory.org/the-narrative-paradigm/|title=The Narrative Paradigm|work=Communication Theory|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the narrative paradigm helps us to explain how humans are able to understand complex information through [[narrative]].

== Background ==
The Narrative Paradigm is a theory that suggests that human beings are natural storytellers and that a good story is more convincing than a good argument. Walter Fisher developed this theory as a solution making cohesive arguments. Fisher conceptualized the paradigm as a way to combat issues in the [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter R.|date=1984-03-01|title=Narration as a human communication paradigm: The case of public moral argument|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637758409390180|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/03637758409390180|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was that human beings were unable to make cohesive traditional arguments. At the time, rational world paradigm was the theory used to satisfy public controversies. He believed that stories have the power to include beginning, middle, and end of an argument and that the rational world paradigm fails to be effective in [[sensemaking]].&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Robert C.|date=1988-09-01|title=The value of the rational world and narrative papradigms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510978809363250|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=204–217|doi=10.1080/10510978809363250|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher uses the term [[paradigm]] rather than [[theory]], meaning a paradigm is broader than a theory. Fisher stated, "There is no genre, including technical communication, that is not an episode in the story of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter|date=1985|title=The Narrative Paradigm: An Elaboration|doi=10.1080/03637758509376117|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=52|issue=4|pages=347–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher believed that humans are not rational and proposed that narrative is the basis of communication. According to this viewpoint, people communicate by telling/observing a persuasive story rather than by producing evidence or constructing a [[logical]] argument. The narrative paradigm is purportedly all-encompassing, allowing all communication to be looked at as a narrative even though it may not conform to the traditional literary requirements of a narrative. He states:
*Humans see the world as a set of stories. Each individual accepts stories that match his or her [[value (semiotics)|values]] and [[belief]]s, understood as [[common sense]].{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}}
*Although people claim that their decisions are rational,{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}} incorporating [[history]], [[culture]], and perceptions about the other people involved, all of these are subjective and incompletely understood.
*Narrative rationality requires stories to be [[probability|probable]], coherent and to exhibit [[fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967775008|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=1259870324|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Storytelling is one of the first language skills that children develop. It is universal across cultures and time.&lt;ref&gt;Langellier, Kristin M. "Personal narratives: Perspectives on theory and research." Text and Performance Quarterly 9.4 (1989): 243–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rational world paradigm==
Walter Fisher conceptualized the Narrative Paradigm in direct contrast to the Rational World Paradigm. "Fisher's interest in narrative developed out of his conclusion that the dominant model for explaining human communication—the rational-world paradigm—was inadequate."&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"/&gt; Rational World Paradigm suggest that an argument is most persuasive when it is logical. This theory is based in the teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucaites |first1=John Louis |last2=Condit |first2=Celeste Michelle |last3=Caudill |first3=Sally |title=Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader |date=Jan 1, 1999 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, some statements are superior to others by virtue of their relationship to true knowledge. This view claims that:
* People are essentially thinking beings, basing their knowledge on evidence-based reasoning.
* Rational argument reflects [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]], and how the case is made. These qualities determine whether the argument is accepted, so long as the form matches the forum, which might be scientific, legal, philosophical, etc.
* The world is a set of logical puzzles that can be solved through reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830512395|title=Interfaith dialogue : listening to communication theory|last=1959-|first=Brown, Daniel S.,|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739178709|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=830512395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative rationality==
Narrative rationality requires coherence and fidelity, which contribute to judgments about reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/456170121|title=Applying communication theory for professional life : a practical introduction|last=Marianne.|first=Dainton,|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Zelley, Elaine D.|isbn=9781412976916|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=456170121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherence===
Narrative [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|coherence]] is the degree to which a story makes sense. Coherent stories are internally consistent, with sufficient detail, reliable characters, and free of major surprises. The ability to assess coherence is learned and improves with experience. Individuals assess a story's coherence by comparing it with similar stories. The ultimate test of narrative coherence is whether the characters act in a reliable way. If characters show continuity throughout their thoughts, motives and actions, acceptance increases. However, characters behaving uncharacteristically destroys acceptance.{{sfn|Griffin|2009}}

===Fidelity===
Narrative fidelity is the degree to which a story fits into the observer's prior understanding. Stories with fidelity may influence their beliefs and values.{{sfn|Griffin|2009|p=304}}

Fisher set five criteria that affect a story's narrative fidelity:
*the values embedded in the story
*the connection between the story, and the espoused values 
*the possible outcomes that would accrue to people adhering to the espoused values
*the consistency of the narrative's values with the observer's values
*the extent to which the story’s values represent the highest values possible in human experience&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Walter R. (1987). ''Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. {{ISBN|0-87249-500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of reasoning systems==
Fisher's narrative paradigm offers an alternative to Aristotelian analysis, which dominates the field of rhetorical thinking. Narratives do not require training or expertise to evaluate. [[Common sense]] assesses narrative coherence and fidelity.{{Sfn|Griffin|2009|p=305}} Busselle and Bilandzic distinguish narrative rationality from realism, writing "It is remarkable that the power of narrative is not diminished by readers’ or viewers’ knowledge that the story is invented. On the contrary, successful stories—those that engage us most—often are both fictional and unrealistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busselle|first=Rick|last2=Bilandzic|first2=Helena|date=2008-05-01|title=Fictionality and Perceived Realism in Experiencing Stories: A Model of Narrative Comprehension and Engagement|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=256|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x|issn=1468-2885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] claimed that communications systems are formed through the ''savoir'' and ''pouvoir'' (knowledge and power) of the hierarchies that control access to the discourses. Hence, criteria for assessing the ''reliability'' and ''completeness'' of evidence, and whether the pattern of reasoning is sound are not absolutes but defined over time by those in positions of authority. This is particularly significant when the process of reasoning includes values and policy in addition to [[empirical]] data.

The narrative paradigm instead asserts that any individual can judge a story's merits as a basis for belief and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Narration affects every aspect of each individual's life in verbal and nonverbal bids for someone to believe or act in a certain way. Even when a message appears abstract—i.e., the language is literal and not figurative—it is narration. This is because it is embedded in the storyteller's ongoing story and it invites observers to assess its value for their own lives.

Narrative rationality and narrative emotion are complementary within a narrative theory. The former considers how effectively the story conveys its meaning, as well as its implications. The latter considers the emotional reactions of the story's observers.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Jeanne|date=2005-09-12|title=A Philosophy of Emoting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186846|journal=Journal of Narrative Theory|volume=34|issue=3|pages=335–372|doi=10.1353/jnt.2005.0003|issn=1548-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Narrative emotion is an emotion felt for the sake of someone, or something, else.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"/&gt;

==Applications==
Narrative theory is an assessment framework within various fields of communication. Those who  use narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of viewing communication. The narrative paradigm is generally considered an interpretative theory of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spector-Mersel|first=Gabriela|date=2010-01-01|title=Narrative research: Time for a paradigm|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|journal=Narrative Inquiry|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=204–224|doi=10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|issn=1387-6740}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an especially useful theory for teaching qualitative research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25592191|title=Rethinking Texts: Narrative and the Construction of Qualitative Research|first1=Karri A.|last1=Holley|first2=Julia|last2=Colyar|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=38|issue=9|pages=680–686|doi=10.3102/0013189x09351979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher’s theory has been considered for domains ranging from organizational communication to family interaction, to racism, and to advertising. McNamara proposed that the narrative paradigm can be used with military storytelling to enhance the perception of the United States armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1d7ae8ad4dfb7a76b376382ca464d8dd/1.pdf|title=How the Narrative Paradigm Affects Military Stories - ProQuest|last=McNamara|first=Richard|date=May 8, 2014|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stutts and Barker, of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], proposed that the Narrative Paradigm can be used to evaluate if a company's brand will be well received by consumers, by determining if the created narrative has coherence and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutts | first1 = Nancy B. | last2 = Barker | first2 = Randolph T. | year = 1999 | title = The use of narrative paradigm theory in assessing audience value conflict in image advertising | url = | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 209–244 | doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers proposed using the narrative paradigm to evaluate ethical standards in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bush | first1 = Alan J. | last2 = Davies Bush | first2 = Victoria | year = 1994 | title = The Narrative Paradigm as a Perspective for Improving Ethical Evaluations of Advertisements | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 23 | issue = 3| page = 31 | doi=10.1080/00913367.1994.10673448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts used the narrative paradigm as a way to better understand the use of narrative in folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Kathleen Glenister | year = 2004 | title = Texturing the narrative paradigm: Folklore and communication | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 129–142 | doi=10.1080/01463370409370186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobart proposed using narrative theory as a way to interpret urban legends and other kinds of hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobart | first1 = Melissa | year = 2013 | title = My Best Friend's Brother's Cousin Knew This Guy Who…: Hoaxes, Legends, Warnings, and Fisher's Narrative Paradigm | url = | journal = Communication Teacher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 90–93 | doi=10.1080/17404622.2013.770155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative paradigm is also applicable when assessing multinational working relationships. Global interactions between groups with different backgrounds have the tendency to hinder group progress and building relationships. Over the past two decades, scholars conceptualize diversity in the workplace using several different theories. As companies continue to diversify, businesses look for communication models to help manage the complex structure of human relationships. Narrative paradigm serves as a communication technique that shows companies how the application of a good story could provide benefits in the workforce. Storytelling is a cross-cultural solution that establishes credibility and trust in relationships between workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Randolph T.|last2=Gower|first2=Kim|date=2010-07-01|title=Strategic Application of Storytelling in Organizations: Toward Effective Communication in a Diverse World|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021943610369782|journal=The Journal of Business Communication (1973)|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=295–312|doi=10.1177/0021943610369782|issn=0021-9436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and politics===
One example of a study that used narrative theory more directly was conducted by Smith in 1984.  Smith looked at the fidelity and coherence of narratives presented as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Party platform|platforms]] in the United States and found that despite obvious differences, each party was able to maintain coherence and fidelity by remaining consistent in both structure and overarching party values.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and health communication===
A study claimed that narrative features can be strategically altered by health communicators to affect the reader's identification. It found that similarities between the reader and the narrative's protagonist, but not the narrator's point of view, has a direct impact on the narrative's persuasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Meng|last2=Bell|first2=Robert A.|date=August 2, 2016|title=Narrator Point of View and Persuasion in Health Narratives: The Role of Protagonist–Reader Similarity, Identification, and Self-Referencing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=21|issue=8|pages=908–918|doi=10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|pmid=27411000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and branding===
Narrative processing can create or enhance connections between a brand and an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edson Escalas|first=|year=|title=Narrative Processing: Building Consumer Connections to Brands|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740804701448|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=14|pages=164–180|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp1401&amp;2_19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and business use stories or brands that suggest a story to produce [[brand loyalty]]. Businesses invest heavily in creating a good story through advertising and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutts|first=Nancy B.|last2=Barker|first2=Randolph T.|date=2016-08-15|title=The Use of Narrative Paradigm Theory in Assessing Audience Value Conflict in Image Advertising|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0893318999132002|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=209–244|doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brand development, many marketers focus on defining a brand [[persona (marketing)|persona]] (typical user) before constructing a narrative for that brand. Character traits such as honesty, curiosity, flexibility and determination become embedded in the persona. Commitment to the associated behavioral implications can help the brand maintain consistency with its narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen Herskovitz|first=|date=May 4, 2010|title=The essential brand persona: storytelling and branding|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02756661011036673|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|volume=31|pages=21–28|via=|doi=10.1108/02756661011036673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the narrative paradigm mainly contend that it is not as universally applicable as Fisher suggests. For example, Rowland asserted that it should be applied strictly to communication that fits classic narrative patterns to avoid undermining its credibility.{{sfn|Rowland|1989}}

Other critiques include issues of conservative bias. Kirkwood stated that Fisher's logic of good reasons focuses only on prevailing issues&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, William G. (1992) "Narrative and the Rhetoric of Possibility" (Vol. 59, Issue 1) pp30–47.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not see all the ways that stories can promote [[social change]].&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=qEhTpwAACAAJ}}|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last1=West|first1=Richard L.|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|date=December 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-132647-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways, both Kirkwood and Fisher agree that this observation is more of an extension to the theory than a critique.

Stroud considered "multivalent" narratives that include seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stroud | first1 = Scott R | year = 2002 | title = Multivalent Narratives: Extending the Narrative Paradigm with Insights from Ancient Indian Philosophical Texts | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 369–393 | doi=10.1080/10570310209374742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of communication are not narrative in the way that Fisher maintains. Many [[science fiction]] and fantasy novels/movies challenge rather than conform to common values.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt;

The narrative approach does not provide a more democratic structure compared to the one imposed by the rational world paradigm. Nor does it offer a complete alternative to that paradigm.{{sfn|Rowland|1989|p=39}}
The narrative paradigm gained attention from poststructuralist education theorists for appealing to notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=d498cc1b-1b67-4073-8139-f40e460ba9cd%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=91821607&amp;db=ofm|title=Narrative Theory Versus Truth: A Poststructuralist Reading in Environmental Education.|last=Hardy|first=Joy|date=June 1, 2012|website=Ebsco Host|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
===Rhetoric theory===
The narrative paradigm incorporates both the pathos and logos form of rhetoric theory. Rhetoric theory was formulated by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Michel|date=2012-09-11|title=Aristotle’s Rhetoric|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|journal=Topoi|volume=32|pages=249–252|doi=10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines rhetoric as: the available means of persuasion.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt; It includes two assumptions.
* Effective public speakers must consider their audience.
* Effective public speakers supply proofs.
Aristotle divided public speaking into three parts: the speaker, the subject and the audience. He considered the audience the most important, determining the speech’s end and object. Therefore, audience analysis, which is the process of evaluating an audience and its background is essential.

In the second assumption, Aristotle’s proof refers to the means of persuasion. And these three proof types are [[Ethos]], [[Pathos]] and [[Logos]].
* Ethos: The perceived character, intelligence and goodwill of a speaker as they become revealed through his or her speech. 
* Logos: The logic proof that speakers employ. 
* Pathos: The emotions that are drawn out of listeners. 
Rhetoric theory can be applied in multiple areas, such as in the social/environmental report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Colin|year=September 2012|title=Ethos, logos, pathos: Strategies of persuasion in social/environmental reports|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0155998212000178|journal=Accounting Forum|volume=36|pages=194–208|via=|doi=10.1016/j.accfor.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] post, etc.

===Situation models===
When people experience a story, the comprehension phase is where they form a mental representation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf. "Current Directions In Psychological Science." Current Directions In Psychological Science. n. 15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a mental representation is called a situation model. Situation models are representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself. Much of the research suggests that observers behave as though they are in the story rather than outside of it. This supports Fisher’s model that narrative components supported by good reasons are related to components in situation models.

====Space====
Situation models represent relevant aspects of the narrative's environment. Objects that are spatially close to observers are generally more relevant than more distant objects. The same holds for situation models. Observers are similarly slower to recognize words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those close to the protagonist.{{sfn|Glenberg|Meyer|Lindem|1987|p=}} When observers have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the story setting (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is close to. For example, they can more readily say whether two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is close to the protagonist. The interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting the movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. The interpretation of observers also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure. Observers behave as if they are actually present in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=Rolf A.|date=1999|title=Situation Models: The Mental Leap into Imagined Worlds|jstor=20182546|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.2307/20182546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goals and causation====
In one study observers recognized goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist more quickly than goals that had just been accomplished. When Keefe and McDaniel presented subjects with sentences such as "after standing through a 3-hour debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)" and then with probe words (e.g., "sat").&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf.

The '''Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest''' is an annual American [[hot dog]] [[competitive eating]] competition. It is held each year on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's Famous Corporation]]'s original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and [[Stillwell Avenue]]s in [[Coney Island]], a  neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

The contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and [[Joey Chestnut]]. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 74 hot dogs in the 2018 contest. The defending women's champion is Miki Sudo, who ate 37 hot dogs in the 2018 contest.

== Rules ==

[[File:Original Nathans.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] original [[Coney Island]] location]]

[[Major League Eating]] (MLE), formerly known as the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.

The field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:

* the defending champion;
* winners of a regional qualifying contest for that season;
* individuals qualifying as one of two [[Wild card (sports)|wildcards]] (highest two average qualifier scores without winning a single qualifier); and
* those invited by special invitation of the MLE. ''(See [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest#Controversies|"Controversies" section]] below.)''

The competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant that consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.

Spectators watch and cheer the eaters on from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the [[granularity]] of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. [[Penalty card#Yellow card|Yellow penalty cards]] can be issued for "messy eating,"&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"&gt;{{Cite episode| title=2011 Hot Dog Eating Contest (Live Television Broadcast)| network= ESPN| airdate = 2011-07-04|series=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and red penalty cards can be issued for "[[regurgitation (digestion)|reversal of fortune]]", which results in disqualification.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many more quickly. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.

After the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.

==Awards==
The winner of the men's competition is given possession of the coveted international "bejeweled" mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of "unknown age and value" according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] won the inaugural women's competition and its "bejeweled" pink belt.

Various other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 [[Orbitz]] donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.

==History==

The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the [[Nathan's Famous|original location]] on [[Coney Island]] most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts| title=Famous Facts| publisher=Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs| accessdate=December 11, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803005044/http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts |archivedate = August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan's promoter Mortimer Matz claimed that on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most [[patriotism|patriotic]]. He also made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941 ("as a protest to the war in Europe") and 1971 (as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.). A man by the name of Jim Mullen is said to have won the first contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Fagone|date=2007|title=Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y7fSMRrkUEC&amp;pg=PT271&amp;dq=%22Jim+Mullen*+is+the+original+hot-dog+champion.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMkeaBtd3NAhXLOz4KHWytARgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jim%20Mullen*%20is%20the%20original%20hot-dog%20champion.%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Crown/Archetype (p. 215)}}&lt;/ref&gt; although accounts vary. One account describes [[Jimmy Durante]] (who was ''not'' an immigrant) as competing in that all-immigrant inaugural contest, which was judged by [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America is 204 years old|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bMUPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wo0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5694%2C528768|work=Boca Raton (Fla.) News (sec. A, p. 2)|date=July 4, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another describes the event as beginning "in 1917, and pitted [[Mae West]]'s father, Jack, against entertainer Eddie Cantor."&lt;ref name="Crown/Archetype (p. 222)"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Fagone|date=2007|title=Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utR6mUoZBVIC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=%22Rosey+also+elaborated+on+the+contest%27s+backstory%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVjvqlpt3NAhWLMj4KHVBwAMQQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rosey%20also%20elaborated%20on%20the%20contest's%20backstory%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Crown/Archetype (p. 222)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, however, promoter Mortimer "Morty" Matz admitted to having fabricated the legend of the 1916 start date with a man named Max Rosey in the early 1970s as part of a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="NYT 08-18-2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/nyregion/19experience.html |title=No, He Did Not Invent the Publicity Stunt" by Sam Roberts, New York Times, August 18, 2010 | work=The New York Times | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend grew over the years, to the point where ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other publications were known to have repeatedly listed 1916 as the inaugural year, although no evidence of the contest exists.&lt;ref name="NYT 08-18-2010"/&gt; As Coney Island is often linked with recreational activities of the summer season, several early contests were held on other holidays associated with summer besides Independence Day; [[Memorial Day]] contests were scheduled for 1972,&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert D.

News-Press (sec. A, p. 2)|date=September 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the competition was dominated by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] contestants, particularly [[Takeru Kobayashi]], who won six consecutive contests from 2001-2006. In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs—smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous [[competitive eating]] world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.

On July 4, 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] became the champion of the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitney Holtzman |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/features/article/6721754/nathan-evens-playing-field |title=Nathan's evens playing field |publisher=ESPN |date=2 July 2011| accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one all-female Memorial Day competition held in 1975.&lt;ref name="New York Times no. 2"/&gt; Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.&lt;ref name="First Nathan Champ for Women"&gt;{{cite web

In recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual [[spectacle]] of [[Sports entertainment|competitive entertainment]]. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the [[mayor of New York City]]. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or [[makeup]], while others may promote themselves with eating-related [[List of competitive eaters|nicknames]]. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the "bus of champions" and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion [[Joey Chestnut]] was escorted to the stage in a [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]].

The competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. In 2004 a three-story-high "Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame" was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. Despite substantial damage suffered at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] due to [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.

ESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with [[Major League Eating]] and will broadcast the contest through 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-espn-hot-dog-eating-contest-20140701,0,7676919.story |title=ESPN Locks In Hot Dog Eating Contest through 2024 |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event continues to be recognized for its power as a marketing tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/07/03/nathans-famous-contest-is-fourth-of-july-marketing-magic |title=Nathan's Famous Contest is Fourth of July Marketing Magic |publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===

Controversies usually revolve around supposed breaches of rules that are missed by the judges. For example, [[NY1]] television news editor Phil Ellison reviewed taped footage of the 1999 contest and thought that [[Steve Keiner]] started eating at the count of one, but the judge, [[Michael DeVito|Mike DeVito]]—himself the champion of the 1990, 1993, and 1994 contests—was stationed directly in front of Keiner and disputed it, saying it was incorrect. Keiner ate 21 1/2 dogs, as shown on the Wall of Fame located at Nathan's flagship store at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island. This controversy was created by George Shea, the chief publicist for Nathan's, because it created much more publicity for the contest. Shea assured Keiner at the end of the contest that he would clear the confusion up but never did. Keiner never participated in any advertising or contests set up by Shea because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Another controversy occurred in 2003 when former [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[William Perry (American football)|William "The Refrigerator" Perry]] competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. Shea stated that the celebrity contestant experiment will likely not be repeated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

At the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] had vomited (also known as a "Roman method incident" or "reversal of fortune") in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi's favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/rovell/020704.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Accusations hurled at hot dog contest |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a victory over [[Eric Booker|Eric "Badlands" Booker]].

Takeru Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest. In 2010, he was arrested by police after attempting to jump on the stage after the contest was over and disrupt the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/415463-chestnut-wins-for-4th-straight-year-kobayashi-arrested|title=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 2010: Joey Chestnut Wins for Fourth Year|date=4 July 2010|publisher= [[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/04/2010-07-04_joey_jaws_chestnut_wins_nathans_july_fourth_hot_dog_eating_contest.html|title=Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut Wins Nathan's July Fourth Hot Dog Eating Contest|date=July 4, 2010| work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | accessdate= July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38086913/ns/sports-othersports/|title=Kobayashi Arrested After Chestnut's Hot Dog Win|date= July 4, 2010|publisher= [[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2010, all charges against Kobayashi were dismissed by a judge in Brooklyn.

===Newspapers===
News sources typically use puns in head-lines and copy referring to the contest, such as "'Tsunami' is eating contest's top dog again," "couldn't cut the mustard" ([[Associated Press|A.P.]]), "Nathan's King ready, with relish" (Daily News) and "To be frank, Fridge faces a real hot-dog consumer" ([[ESPN]]).

Reporter [[Gersh Kuntzman]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' has been covering the event since the early 1990s and has been a judge at the competition since 2000. [[Darren Rovell]], of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/040507|title=Athletes with appetite|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Darren|last=Rovell|accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactics and training==
Each contestant has his or her own eating method. [[Takeru Kobayashi]] pioneered the "Solomon Method" at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.

"Dunking" is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt;

Other methods used include the "Carlene Pop," where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; "Buns &amp; Roses" is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; "Juliet-ing" is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt;

Contestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some [[Fasting|fast]], others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed "Cookie" Jarvis, aim to be "hungry, but not too hungry" and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.

{{Rights}}
The '''right of publicity''', often called '''personality rights''', is the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his or her name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of one's [[personal identity|identity]]. It is generally considered a property right as opposed to a personal right, and as such, the validity of the right of publicity can survive the death of the individual (to varying degrees depending on the jurisdiction).

==Classification==
Personality rights are generally considered to consist of two types of rights: the right of publicity, or to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation, which is similar to the use of a [[trademark]]; and the [[right to privacy]], or the right to be left alone and not have one's personality represented publicly without permission. In [[common law]] jurisdictions, '''publicity rights''' fall into the realm of the [[tort]] of [[passing off]]. [[United States]] [[jurisprudence]] has substantially extended this right.

A commonly cited justification for this doctrine, from a policy standpoint, is the notion of [[natural rights]] and the idea that every individual should have a right to control how, if at all, his or her "persona" is commercialized by third parties.  Usually, the motivation to engage in such commercialization is to help propel sales or visibility for a product or service, which usually amounts to some form of [[commercial speech]] (which in turn receives the lowest level of judicial scrutiny). If an individual violates this right they will have to go through a lawsuit.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Civil law and common law jurisdictions==
[[Image:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world: civil law in blue, common law in red.]]

In contrast with common law jurisdictions, most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions have specific civil code provisions that protect an individual's image, personal data and other generally private information.  Exceptions have been carved out of these general, broad privacy rights when dealing with news and public figures. Thus, while it may violate an ordinary citizen's privacy to speak about their medical records, one is generally allowed to report on more intimate details in the lives of celebrities and politicians.

Unlike most common law jurisdictions the personality rights in civil law are generally inheritable, thus one can make a claim against someone who invades the privacy of a deceased relative if the memory of their character is besmirched by such publication.

[[Image:Common law world.png|thumb|
{{Legend|#000075|Common law}}
{{Legend|#0075FF|Mixed systems using elements of common law}}
{{Legend|#A3A3A3|Civil, customary and/or religious law &lt;small&gt;(see map above)&lt;/small&gt;}}]]

Personality rights have developed out of [[common law]] concepts of [[property]], [[trespass]] and intentional [[tort]].  Thus personality rights are, generally speaking, judge-made law, though there are [[jurisdiction]]s where some aspects of personality rights are statutory. In some jurisdictions, publicity rights and privacy rights are not clearly distinguished, and the term publicity right is generally used. In a publicity rights case the issue to decide is whether a significant section of the public would be misled into believing (incorrectly) that a commercial arrangement had been concluded between a [[plaintiff]] and a [[defendant]] under which the plaintiff agreed to the advertising involving the image or reputation of a famous person. The actionable misrepresentation requires a suggestion that the plaintiff has endorsed or licensed the defendant's products, or somehow can exercise control over those products. This is done by way of the [[tort]] of [[passing off]].

The meaning of the law is best illustrated by principal cases on the subject.

==Country-specific jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In Australia, false association or endorsement is actionable via the law of [[passing off]], not a separate law of "right of personality". The ''Henderson'' case&lt;ref&gt;''Henderson v Radio Corp Pty Ltd'', (1960) 60 SR(NSW) 576, [1969] RPC 218&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (both the first instance and appellate jurisdiction). The plaintiffs were [[ballroom dance]]rs and they sued the defendant in passing off alleging it wrongfully published their photograph on the cover of a gramophone record entitled ''Strictly for Dancing: Vol. 1''. An injunction was granted on the ground that the use suggested the plaintiffs recommended or approved of the defendant's goods, or had some connection with the goods.

However, in the 1988 case of ''Honey v Australian Airlines'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Gary Honey v Australian Airlines Limited and House of Tabor Inc|link=|court=FCA|num=177|year=1989|parallelcite=|date=18 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Honey, a well known Australian athlete failed in his attempt to get a damages award after [[Australian Airlines]] used a photograph of him in action on a poster without his permission.  The judge held, in essence, that the poster depicted excellence in general rather than a particular person.

===Canada===

====Statutory protection====
The provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Saskatchewan]] have enacted privacy legislation dealing with personality rights, which have the following traits:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=4{{endash}}7}}

#An appropriation of personality can be achieved through the use of a person’s name, likeness, or voice (but British Columbia has a more restrictive definition).
#The plaintiff must be identified or identifiable by the use made of his persona.
#An action for the appropriation of personality can only succeed where the defendant intended to commit the wrong (but British Columbia has no "intention" requirement).
#The defendant’s use of the plaintiff’s persona must have resulted in a gain or advantage for the defendant (but British Columbia has a more restrictive definition, relating only to commercial gain).
#An appropriation of personality is actionable without proof of damages.
#The right of action for appropriation of personality is extinguished upon the death of the person whose privacy was violated.
#The following constitute statutory defences in all four provinces: (i) that the plaintiff consented to the use of his persona; (ii) that the use of the plaintiff’s persona was incidental to the exercise of a lawful right of defence of person or property; (iii) that the use was authorized or required under a provincial law or by a court, or any process of a court; and (iv) that the act was that of a peace officer acting in the course of his or her duties. The Manitoba Act provides additional defences.

====Common law provinces====
Canadian common law recognizes a limited right to personality. It was first acknowledged in the 1971 Ontario decision of ''[[Krouse v. Chrysler Canada Ltd.]]'', where the Court held that where a person has marketable value in their likeness and it has been used in a manner that suggests an endorsement of a product then there is grounds for an action in appropriation of personality. This right was later expanded upon in ''[[Athans v. Canadian Adventure Camps]]'' (1977) where the Court held that the personality right included both image and name.

In ''[[Gould Estate v. Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd.]]'' (1998), the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that simply writing &lt;u&gt;about&lt;/u&gt; somebody, even for the purpose of generating a profit, does not constitute appropriation of personality.

The general tort of appropriation of personality is still in development, but it is currently{{when|date=June 2017}} being argued that it will be recognized in all common law provinces,{{sfn|Conroy|2012|p=10}} with certain characteristics:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=11{{endash}}14}}

#''Athans'' confirms that there is "a proprietary right in the exclusive marketing for gain of his personality, image and name..."
#There is always a requirement that the plaintiff be identifiable.
#An action for appropriation of personality will have to be intentional for a plaintiff to recover at common law.
#There is a requirement that the defendant must have acted for the purpose of commercial gain, but ''Gould'' suggests that this may be restricted to "endorsement-type situations".
#It is a matter of uncertainty whether the common law tort of appropriation of personality is actionable ''[[per se (terminology)|per se]]'' or whether damages must be shown.
#Privacy rights are extinguished upon death, but personality rights are inheritable.
#A defendant will not be liable for an appropriation of personality at common law where: (i) he has consented to the use of his persona; (ii) the use made of his personality rights was merely incidental to another purpose; or (iii) the publication constituted a matter of public interest.

====Quebec====
In 1994, the new ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' introduced new provisions that enshrine the right to privacy as an attribute of personality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|3}}, {{cite CCQ|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
'''3.''' Every person is the holder of personality rights, such as the right to life, the right to the inviolability and integrity of his person, and the right to the respect of his name, reputation and privacy. These rights are inalienable.

...

'''36.''' The following acts, in particular, may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person:

:(1) entering or taking anything in his dwelling;
:(2) intentionally intercepting or using his private communications;
:(3) appropriating or using his image or voice while he is in private premises;
:(4) keeping his private life under observation by any means;
:(5) using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public;
:(6) using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.
}}

In ''[[Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] also affirmed that under Quebec's ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'' privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|link=Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc|year=1998|court=scc|num=817|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 55{{en dash}}59|parallelcite=[1998] 1 SCR 591|date=1998-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant provisions of the ''Charter'' are:

{{cquote|
'''4.'''  Every person has a right to the safeguard of his dignity, honour and reputation.

'''5.'''  Every person has a right to respect for his private life.
}}

Therefore, the following general characteristics may be drawn:{{sfn|Conroy|2012|pp=15{{endash}}17}}

#An appropriation of personality can be realized through the use of a person’s name, likeness, or voice.
#The plaintiff must be recognizable in order  an appropriation of personality to be actionable.
#There is no need for the courts to look for an element of intent.
#Distinctions based on commercial purposes are irrelevant, and inconsistent with s 9.1 of the Quebec ''Charter''.
#The plaintiff is required to show that she suffered damage through the appropriation of her personality rights.
#Quebec law may allow an action to be taken by the estate of a deceased person, provided that it can be proved that there is a patrimonial aspect at stake.
#A defendant will not be liable for an appropriation of personality under Quebec law where: (i) the plaintiff expressly or impliedly consented to the appropriation of his personality; (ii) the use of the individual’s persona is incidental to another purpose; (iii) the appropriation of personality is authorized by law; or (iv) the publication is a matter of public interest.

===Cyprus===
In [[Cyprus]], people depicted in photographs can oppose their use in advertisements and their publication in magazines, even if it was taken in a public place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataprotection.gov.cy/dataprotection/dataprotection.nsf/All/819392DD9D123E4CC225750B00379242?OpenDocument |script-title=el:Γραφείο Επιτρόπου Προστασίας Δεδομένων Προσωπικού Χαρακτήρα - Αποφάσεις |language=el |publisher=Dataprotection.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the [[Danish Penal Code]] chapters 26 and 27, provides certain personality rights. The governmental Danish Data Protection Agency, has made a declaration regarding publication on the Internet of pictures taken of persons in a public area:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datatilsynet.dk/borger/internettet/billeder-paa-internettet/ Datatilsynet: Billeder på internettet] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The predominant point of reference, is that any publication of a portrait photograph requires consent [of the person depicted]. The reasoning for this, is that such a publication might provide the depicted person with discomfort, possibly with other information such as name, of the publication for all with access to the internet, and the considerations of this discomfort is judged as more important than a possible interest in publication.''
A portrait photograph is defined as a photograph, with the purpose of depicting one or more specific person(s). The personality rights however may be contracted for persons who are generally accepted as public persons.

===France===
In [[France]] personality rights are protected under article 9 of the French civil code.  While publicly known facts and images of public figures are not generally protected, use of someone's image or personal history has been held actionable under French law. The most famous case in recent history is perhaps the publication of the book on [[François Mitterrand]] called ''Le Grand Secret''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gubler|first= Claude|year= 2005|title= Le Grand Secret|trans-title=|url= https://www.amazon.fr/Le-grand-secret-Claude-Gubler/dp/2268053849|language= fr|location= |publisher= Éditions du Rocher|isbn= 978-2-26805384-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Mitterrand's doctor published a book that not only revealed private facts about Mitterrand's life, but also revealed medical confidences protected by [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient privilege]].

===Germany===
In [[Germany]] personality rights are protected under the German civil code, where the concept of an "absolute person of contemporary history" allows the depiction of individuals who are part of history but still gives them some protection of their rights of privacy outside the public sphere. A succinct statement of the German law can be found in the following judicial statement from the ''[[Marlene Dietrich]] case'':

{{cquote|
The general right of personality has been recognised in the case law of the Bundesgerichtshof since 1954 as a basic right constitutionally guaranteed by Arts 1 and 2 of the Basic Law and at the same time as an "other right" protected in civil law under § 823 (1) of the BGB (constant case law since BGHZ 13, 334, 338 - readers' letters). It guarantees as against all the world the protection of human dignity and the right to free development of the personality. Special forms of manifestation of the general right of personality are the right to one's own picture (§§ 22 ff. of the KUG) and the right to one's name (§ 12 of the BGB). They guarantee protection of the personality for the sphere regulated by them (reference omitted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Marlene Dietrich Case|vol= |reporter= BGH|opinion= 1 ZR 49/97|pinpoint= |court= |date= 1 December 1999|url= http://www.utexas.edu/law/academics/centers/transnational/work_new/german/case.php?id=726|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The relevant Greek laws include 57 AK and 2472/1997. As regarding photography:
* '''Taking a picture of a person in a public space:''' Requires consent. Taking a photo or video of someone or drawing them in a painting constitutes an illegal act by itself according to Article 57 of the Greek Civil Code (57 ΑΚ, 57 Αστικός Κώδικας) even without any publication of the resulting photo, video or drawing. The law assumes that consent has been provided silently if the depicted person has been paid for the photography session. The law also provides some exceptions for persons of ''contemporary history''.&lt;ref name="greek57ak"&gt;http://greeklaws.com/pubs/uploads/2795.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the law 2472/1997 also applies in many circumstances, even in photographing political rallies in public places or in photographing the police; Greece also requires photographers to obtain a government permit before photographing people participating in political protests in public places.&lt;ref name="greekpolice"&gt;{{cite web|author=e-Lawyer |url=http://elawyer.blogspot.gr/2009/12/blog-post_8090.html |title=E-Lawyer: Λήψη φωτογραφιών σε δημόσιες συναθροίσεις παρουσία αστυνομίας |publisher=Elawyer.blogspot.gr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guernsey===
The relevant Guernsey law was enacted on 3 December 2012 under the name of [http://www.guernseylegalresources.gg/article/104749/Image-Rights-Bailiwick-of-Guernsey-Ordinance-2012 Image Rights Bailiwick of Guernsey Ordinance 2012] and allows for the registration of a personality right, together with images associated with that personality. Images are widely defined and can be any number of personal attributes, such as likeness, mannerisms, gestures, voice, nickname etc.

Personalities able to register fall into 5 categories, namely sole, joint, group, legal and fictional character. In addition, humans can be registered up to 100 years after the date of death, making the law very favourable for estate managers and trustees.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], as in most other common law jurisdictions, there is no separate "personality right", and false association or endorsement is actionable under the law of passing off. The main case on this point relates to [[Cantopop]] singer/actor [[Andy Lau]] and [[Hang Seng Bank]] over the allegedly unauthorized use of Lau's image on [[credit card]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hong Kong case|litigants=Lau Tak Wah Andy v.

===People's Republic of China===
In the [[People's Republic of China]], rights of personality are established by statute.
According to article 99 and 100 of  the [[General Principle of Civil Law (China)|General Principle of Civil Law]] of the People's Republic of China, the right of name and the right of image are protected. It is prohibited to use another's image for commercial use without that person's consent.
In the new{{when|date=October 2014}} Tort Liabilities Law, the right of privacy is mentioned for the first time in the legislation.

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] personality rights are protected under the [[South African law of delict]] and the [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa|Bill of Rights]], which also provides for [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burchell|first=Jonathan|title=The Legal Protection of Privacy in South Africa: A Transplantable Hybrid|url=http://www.ejcl.org/131/art131-2.pdf|date=March 2009|work=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|accessdate=30 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207084836/http://www.ejcl.org/131/art131-2.pdf|archivedate=7 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much uncertainty concerning the recognition of [[image rights]] in [[South Africa]], the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] provided clarity in the landmark case of ''Grütter v Lombard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2007/2.html|title=Grütter v Lombard and Another (628/05) [2007] ZASCA 2; [2007] 3 All SA 311 (SCA) (20 February 2007)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2007 4 SA 89 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11380578/Image_Rights_in_South_Africa Cornelius, Steve.

Secondly, the right to identity is violated if the attributes of a person is used without authorization by another person for commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2009/173.html|title=Wells v Atoll Media (Pty) Ltd and Another (11961/2006) [2009] ZAWCHC 173; [2010] 4 All SA 548 (WCC) (9 November 2009)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2011/56.html|title=Kumalo v Cycle Lab (Pty) Ltd (31871/2008) [2011] ZAGPJHC 56 (17 June 2011)|website=www.saflii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unauthorized use of the individual's image, such use also primarily entails a commercial motive which is exclusively aimed at promoting a service or product or to solicit clients or customers.  The mere fact that the user may benefit or profit from any product or service in respect of which the individual's attributes have incidentally been used, is not in itself sufficient.  This violation of the right to identity therefore also entails unauthorized use of the individual's attributes with a commercial purpose, whether it is done by means of advertisement or the manufacture and distribution of merchandise covered with the attributes of the individual. Personality rights are not absolute and it goes without saying that the use of a person's attributes must be unlawful before a plaintiff will succeed with any claim.  With the use of a person's image, the personality rights, privacy, [[human dignity]] and [[freedom of association]] of the individual must often be weighed against the user's right to [[freedom of expression]].  The use of a person’s image can be justified on the grounds of consent, truth and public interest, fair comment and jest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11380508/Commercial_Appropriation_of_a_Persons_Image Cornelius, Steve.

===United States===
In the United States, the right of publicity is a [[state law]]-based right, as opposed to federal, and recognition of the right can vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightofpublicity.com/statutes|title=Statutes|publisher = rightofpublicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale underlying the right of publicity in the [[United States]] is rooted in both privacy and economic exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Beebe|first1= Barton|last2= Cotter|first2= Thomas |last3= Lemley|first3= Mark|last4= Menell|first4= Peter|last5= Merges|first5= Robert|year= 2011|title= Trademarks, Unfair Competition, and Business Torts|url= |location= |publisher= Aspen Publishers|isbn= 978-0-73558877-6|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights are based in tort law, and the four causes of action are: 1) Intrusion upon physical solitude; 2) public disclosure of private facts; 3) depiction in a false light; and 4) appropriation of name and likeness.  Typically, but by no means exclusively, the right of publicity is manifest in advertising or merchandise.  In states without a specific right of publicity statute, the right of publicity may still be recognized via common law.  The right of publicity has evolved rapidly, with a history of reported cases in the United States and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightofpublicity.com|title=Right of publicity informational resource website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the broadest definition, the right of publicity is the right of every individual to control any commercial use of his name, image, likeness, or some other identifying aspect of identity, limited (under U.S. law) by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The right of publicity can be referred to as '''publicity rights''' or even '''personality rights.''' The term "right of publicity" was coined by Judge [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc.|vol= 202|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 866|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1953|url= http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/202/866/216723/|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of recognition of this right in the U.S. is largely driven by [[statute]] or [[case law]]. Because the right of publicity is primarily governed by state (as opposed to federal) law, the degree of recognition of the right of publicity varies significantly from one state to the next.  The [[Lanham Act]] governs federal protection of personality rights, and the doctrine has much in common with the laws defining federal protection of trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an individual’s identity could be considered their personal “mark”, the misappropriation of which is sufficient to constitute infringement. In addition, both trademark and publicity rights appear to be designed somewhat to combat infringement for the sake of consumers, granting a cause of action for false descriptions, false representations, and false endorsement claims. Just as there is a cause of action for implying a certain brand sponsors a product when it really does not, there is a cause an action if a celebrity’s identity is used to imply endorsement for a product they are not, in actuality, affiliated with. Courts will typically consider eight factors when weighing a false endorsement claim, in order to determine the likelihood of consumer confusion:

#the strength of his mark.
#the degree of similarity between the two marks.
#the proximity of the products/services.
#the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap.
#actual confusion.
#the defendant's good faith in adopting its own mark.
#the quality of the defendant's product.
#the sophistication of the buyers.

These eight factors have their origins in the case ''[[Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.|vol= 287|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 492|pinpoint= |court= 2d Cir.|date= 1961|url= http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are similarly used by courts to analyze false endorsement claims by celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in cases such as {{cite court |litigants= Waits v.

[[Indiana]] is believed to have the most far-reaching right of publicity statutes in the world, providing recognition of the right for 100 years after death, and protecting not only the usual "name, image and likeness," but also [[signature]], [[photograph]], [[gesture]]s, distinctive appearances, and mannerisms.  There are other notable characteristics of the Indiana law, though most of the major movement in right of publicity emanates from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]], with a significant body of case law which suggest two potentially contradictory positions with respect to recognition of the right of publicity.

Some states recognize the right through statute and some others through common law. California has both statutory and common-law strains of authority protecting slightly different forms of the right. The right of publicity is a property right, rather than a tort, and so the right may be transferable to the person's heirs after their death. The [[Celebrities Rights Act]] was passed in [[California]] in 1985 and it extended the personality rights for a celebrity to 70 years after their death. Previously, the 1979 ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that [[Bela Lugosi]]'s personality rights could not pass to his heirs.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Feb/1/130405.html |title=Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979). |accessdate=2007-02-14 |quote=In this decision preceding (and precipitating) the Legislature's enactment of Section 990, the California Supreme Court held that rights of publicity were not descendible in California. Bela Lugosi's heirs, Hope Linninger Lugosi and Bela George Lugosi, sued to enjoin and recover profits from Universal Pictures for licensing Lugosi's name and image on merchandise reprising Lugosi's title role in the 1930 film, "Dracula." The California Supreme Court faced the question whether Bela Lugosi's film contracts with Universal included a grant of merchandising rights in his portrayal of Count Dracula, and the descendibility of any such rights. Adopting the opinion of Justice Roth for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, the court held that the right to exploit one's name and likeness is personal to the artist and must be exercised, if at all, by him during his lifetime.

They argued that this right was essentially property and therefore should pass on to heirs. In a California suit, they asked the courts to stop [[Universal Pictures]] from merchandising 70 Dracula products, ranging from jigsaw puzzles to belt buckles, and sought compensation based on the profits. Citing the First Amendment, Universal replied that the design of merchandise is a form of free speech that should not be restrained by anyone's heirs. Besides, said Universal's lawyer, Robert Wilson, Lugosi "attained fame and fortune because the company made and distributed the movies he starred in." After eleven years of wrangling, a trial judge decided in favor of the Lugosis, giving them $70,000 and barring Universal from merchandising Lugosi's likeness. ... In December the California Supreme Court reversed the Lugosi decision. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= July 7, 1980 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2008, a federal judge in California ruled that [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s rights of publicity were not protectable in California.

*In the 2009 case of ''[[James "Jim" Brown v.

Applying this test, the court found a lack of implied endorsement and held that the First Amendment protected Electronic Arts in its use of a virtual football player that resembled Mr. Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://206.204.99.39/media/brown.pdf|title=''James "Jim" Brown v.

A '''punch line''' ('''punch-line''' or '''punchline''') concludes a [[joke]]; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the [[Joke#Telling jokes|typical joke structure]]. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.

In a broader sense, punch line can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.

== Etymology ==
{{weasel|section|date=March 2018}}
The origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic "set-up, premise, punch line" format was well-established in [[Vaudeville]] by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term "punch line" is first documented in the 1920s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punch%20line|title=Definition of PUNCH LINE|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people{{who|date=March 2018}} argue the term's origin is related to the British weekly magazine ''[[Punch_(magazine)|Punch]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

M-Husler was the first person to come with a punch line in 1986.

== Linguistic analysis ==
A linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by [[Victor Raskin]] in his [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor]]. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. "The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text ''and'' opposite or incompatible with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Raskin|1985 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin’s linguistic theory to include "two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution." He explains that "… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Shultz|1976|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resolution generates laughter.

=== Prosodic features ===
There are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being [[Loudness|louder]] and of a higher [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the speech preceding it, and a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of [[Joke|humorous narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jokes without a punch line ===
In order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line it is useful to look at some joke forms which purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. [[Shaggy dog story|Shaggy dog stories]] are long-winded [[Anti-humor|anti-jokes]] in which the punch line is deliberately anti-climactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny, and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.

Another type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having "a surprising or incongruous punch line" which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ruch|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[no soap radio]] punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.

== Jab lines ==

A joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the [[Narratology|narratological structure]]. With this in mind, the [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humor]] (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term, "jab line", was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. "Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the 'plot' or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2001 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT4MBxNnYA8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=jab+lines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHo4ydQlYT&amp;sig=7Ma6QTiosOAL-YUqoDTwJI9Fd8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HDSbVeTqBNLWoATGxYDwDA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jab%20lines&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this type of humor text analysis, see &gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three part structure ==
Felicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set— the B— is the punchline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:

{{quote|
'''A''' Some men are about to be executed. The guard brings the first man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Earthquake!" Everyone is startled and looks around. In all the confusion, the first man escapes.

'''A''' The guard brings the second man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Tornado!" In the confusion, the second man escapes.

'''B''' By now the last man has it all figured out. The guard brings him forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" and the last man yells, "Fire!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Puppetry''' is a form of [[theatre]] or performance that involves the manipulation of [[puppet]]s – [[inanimate]] objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a [[puppeteer]]. Such a performance is also known as a {{nowrap|'''puppet play'''}}. The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in [[storytelling]].

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are [[finger puppet]]s, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and [[sock puppet]]s, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth". A [[hand puppet]] is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around ([[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. [[Marionette]]s are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as [[sacred]] objects in [[rituals]], as symbolic [[Effigy|effigies]] in celebrations such as [[carnival]]s, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in [[transformative arts]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History'', John Bell, Detroit Institute of Art, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dugan, E.A., ''Emotions in Motion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There is evidence that they were used in [[Egypt]] as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and [[ivory]] have also been found in Egyptian tombs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Hieroglyphs]] also describe "walking statues" being used in ancient [[Egypt]]ian religious dramas.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry was practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, David, ''Puppetry'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and [[masks]]) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and [[mask|masked performance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Asia ===

====East, Southeast and South Asia====
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese "commander-in-chief" marionette character]]
There is slight evidence for puppetry in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14/&gt; The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Tamil literature]] from the [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam Era]], and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including [[edicts of Ashoka|Ashokan edicts]], describe puppets.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14-15&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Works like the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and the ''[[Kamasutra]]'' elaborate on puppetry in some detail.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-15-16&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese ''[[Wayang]]'' theater was influenced by [[India]]n traditions.&lt;ref name=Bell-puppet-46&gt;Bell, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in [[Sanskrit]] plays was known as "Sutradhara",  "the holder of strings".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; ''Wayang'' is a strong tradition of puppetry native of [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]] &amp; [[Bali]]. In [[Java]], [[Wayang Kulit Indonesia|wayang kulit]], an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is [[Wayang golek]].

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in "pi-yung xi", the "theatre of the lantern shadows", or, as it is more commonly known today, [[Shadow theatre|Chinese shadow theatre]]. By the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In [[Taiwan]], [[budaixi]] puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, [[somersault]]s in the air.

[[Japan]] has many forms of puppetry, including the [[bunraku]]. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.

[[Image:Rajasthani-puppeteer.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer from [[Rajasthan]] (India)]]
In [[Korea]], the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King.&lt;ref name="sangsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/768|author=Sang-su, Choe|title=A Study of the Korean Puppet Play|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean, the word for puppet is "Kkoktugakshi".&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt; "Gagsi" means a "bride" or a "young woman", which was the most common form the dolls took. A [[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkoktugakshi puppet play]] has eight scenes.&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt;

[[Thailand]] has [[Hun Krabok]], a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.

[[Vietnam]] developed the art form of [[water puppetry]], that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.

====India====
{{Main|Puppetry in India}}
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' there are references to puppets. The [[Rajasthani Puppet]] from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, [[Ramdas Padhye]], subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.php|title=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT)|website=ccrtindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;String puppets
[[File:Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha) at Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune.JPG|thumb|Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha)]]
India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed.  The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

;Shadow puppets
[[File:Tholpava koothu shadow puppet back stage (1).jpg|thumb|Tholpavakoothu (Kerala)]]
India has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. [[Tholpavakoothu]] (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of [[shadow puppetry]] that is unique to [[Kerala]], [[India]].  The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.

;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. 
;Glove puppets
Glove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the ''dholak''with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.

====Afghanistan====
[[Afghanistan]] has produced a form of puppetry known as [[buz-baz]].  During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a [[markhor]] while playing a [[dambura]].

===West Asia===
[[Image:Karagoez davulcu.jpg|110px|thumb|right|Karagoz, Turkish shadow puppetry]]
Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. [[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in [[Istanbul]] where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Mutlu, Hayali Mustafa, ''Tradition Folk The Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'', a [[metaphor]] translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadow of fancy", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, "the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also..."special effects" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Feeney, John, ''Saudi Aramco World'' (article), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular .&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Willem, ''The History of Theater in Iran'', {{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khane''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets.&lt;ref&gt;Mehr News Agency, [http://www.mehrnews.com www.mehrnews.com], 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran Daily'' [http://www.iran-daily.com www.iran-daily.com], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th/4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from [[ancient Greece]], historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, John, ''Practical Puppetry'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;

In ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]] clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alcamo-Pupi-bjs2007-01.jpg|Sicilian Puppet Theatre|thumb|right]]

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance
Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]] refer to them.&lt;ref name="Binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church used marionettes to perform [[morality plays]].&lt;ref name="Binyon"/&gt; It is believed that the word '''[[marionette]]''' originates from the little figures of the [[Virgin Mary]], hence the word "marionette" or "Mary doll.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Mabel &amp; Les, ''Marionettes: A Hobby for Everyone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more [[ribald]] and [[slapstick]]. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called [[Commedia dell'arte]]. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Suib, Leonard Broadman, Muriel, ''Marionettes Onstage!'', p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called "[[Opera dei pupi]]", or "Opera of the puppets". The "Opera dei pupi" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the [[troubadour|Provençal troubadour tradition]], in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] circles, as a celebration of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Signorelli, Collezione Maria,  [http://www.collezionemariasignorelli.it/inglese_01_inizio.htm www.collezionemariasignorelli.it].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the marionettes of [[Pietro Radillo]] became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====France====
[[Guignol]] is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". [[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Guignol de Lyon]]

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====
[[File:Burattini ca 1770.jpg|British Puppet theatre (Punch and Judy style), c. 1770|thumb|right]]
The traditional British ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The character of "Punch" derives from the character [[Pulcinella]], which was Anglicized to ''Punchinello''. He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]], figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally "Joan", but later became "Judy". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar ''Punch and Judy'' puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable [[:wikt:booth|booth]]. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. One of Shaw's last plays, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

From 1957-1969, [[Gerry Anderson]] produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with [[Roberta Leigh]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ending with ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Many of these series (the most famous of which was ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'') employed a technique called [[Supermarionation]], which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with ''[[Terrahawks]]'' and the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot]] ''[[Space Precinct#Pilot|Space Police]]'' in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the [[Little Angel Theatre]] in [[Islington]], London, [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] in London, [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]], the [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]], [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, [[Biggar, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. [[Don Austen]], a British puppeteer, worked with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and [[Green Ginger]], which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political [[satire]] in the British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including ''[[War Horse (play)|Warhorse]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]] and ''[[Madama Butterfly|Madam Butterfly]]'' at the [[English National Opera]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is ''Jan Klaassen'' (and Judy is ''Katrijn''); in Denmark ''Mester Jackel''; in Russia ''Petrushka''; and in Romania ''Vasilache''. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mullholland, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called [[Kasperle]] of Kaspar while Judy is called [[Grete]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, [[Count Franz Pocci]] founded the [[Münchner Marionettentheater|Munich Marionette Theatre]]. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. [[Albrecht Roser]] has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in [[Stuttgart]]. His characters ''Clown Gustaf'' and ''Grandmother'' are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppets'' by David Currell, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grandmother'', while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In [[Lindau]], [[Lindauer Marionettenoper|the Lindau Marionette Opera]] was founded in 2000 by [[Bernard Leismueller]] and [[Ralf Hechelmann]]. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

In Augsburg, the historic [[Augsburger Puppenkiste|Augsburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1943 by [[Walter Oehmichen]]. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, [[Klaus Marschall]] and [[Juergen Marschall]].

Much earlier in nearby [[Salzburg]], Austria, the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]] and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of [[Gretl Aicher]]. It performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

====Czech Republic====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in [[Prague]], and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="dubska"&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, Jan Novak, Nina Malikova and Marie Zdenkova, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer,&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt;

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, [[Josef Skupa]] created his most famous puppet characters: comical father [[Spejbl]] and his rascal son [[Hurvínek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. An important puppet organisation is the [[National Marionette Theatre]] in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky ("Cakes and Puppets"), founded by [[Marek Bečka]].&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Jiří Trnka]] was an acknowledged leader in this area.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Puppets in Prague, www.puppetsinprague.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]], but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The [[Teotihuacan]] culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also used ceremonial puppets.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied [[Hernando Cortez]] on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals,  working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the [[United States]]. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with [[Howdy Doody]] of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. [[Bil Baird]] worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, [[Cora Eisenberg]] had their own marionette theatre in New York. [[Ventriloquist]], [[Edgar Bergen]] also made a major contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Funni, Arthur, ''The Radio Years of Bergen and McCarthy'' (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Peter Schumann's [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, [[Jim Henson]] was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. Initially, through the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and later in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. [[Wayland Flowers]] also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, [[Madame]].

[[Sid and Marty Krofft]] are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely [[HR Puffinstuff]] and [[Lidsville]]

Puppets also have been used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, notably with the character of [[Yoda]]. His voice and manipulation was provided by [[Frank Oz]].

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, [[Peter Scriven]] founded the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]] and had beautiful marionette productions such as [[The Tintookies]], [[Little Fella Bindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=163386&amp;search=sad&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s= 98/25/2 Marionette puppet, 'Tintookies Little Fella Bindi', Aboriginal figure, papier mache / wood / cotton / felt / feathers / metal, designed by Colin Garland for the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1958-1977 - Powerhouse Museum Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Explorers]] and [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by [[Barbara Turnbull]] and her husband [[Bill Turnbull (puppeteer)]] toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the [[Queensland Arts Council]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]], [[Brisbane]]. [[David Poulton]] toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'Stutter leads to lifetime with puppets', Sunshine Coast Daily, 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hamilton (puppeteer)|David Hamilton]], one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster [[Jamie Dunn]] was famous for his Muppet-style character, [[Agro (puppet)]] who featured on several [[Seven Network]] television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the [[United States]] by puppeteers from the [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson Company]], [[Brett Hansen]] and his [[Brisbane]] based [[Larrikin Puppets]] company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. [[Cabaret Puppet Theatre]], based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cabaret Puppet Theatre www.cabaretpuppettheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne [[Handspan Theatre]] 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

[[File:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|[[Snuff Puppets]] Skullies from Scarey|thumb|right]]
A post-graduate course existed at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer [[Norman Hetherington]] was famous for his marionette, [[Mr. Squiggle]] who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from "squiggles" sent in by children from around the country. [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of [[UNIMA Australia]], former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

[[Rod Hull]] also made a contribution with his puppet [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. [[Snuff Puppets]] is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in [[Melbourne]], their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the "lack of self-consciousness" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History''/John Bell/Chapter 6/Detroit Institute of Art/2000 {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets.png|thumb|Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets]]

[[Sergei Obraztsov]] explored the concept of ''kukolnost'' ('puppetness'), despite [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence on realism.
Other pioneers, including [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Erwin Piscator]] were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. [[Maeterlinck]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as [[Picasso]], [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] began to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Craig's concept of the "übermarionette"&amp;mdash;in which the director treats the actors like objects&amp;mdash;has been highly influential on contemporary "object theatre" and "[[physical theatre]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Tadeusz Kantor]] frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms "putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as [[Tony Sarg]], Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, [[Bil Baird]], Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, [[Peter Schumann]], [[Dattatreya Aralikatte]], [[Jim Henson]], [[Dadi Pudumjee]], and [[Julie Taymor]] have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], Bob Frith of [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and Sandy Speiler of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Theatre, from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook''/James Roose-Evans, 1970 Studio Vista {{ISBN|0-415-00963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jim Henson Foundation]], founded by puppeteer and [[Muppet]] creator [[Jim Henson]], is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Henson Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hensonfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in [[Boise, Idaho]] continue the [[avant garde]] [[satire|satirical]] tradition for [[millennial]]s.&lt;ref name="Early 21st-century puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/horrific-puppet-affair-finds-humor-in-the-space-between-halloween-and-christmas/Content?oid=8219881 |title=Horrific Puppet Affair Finds Humor in the Space Between Halloween and Christmas  |last=Berry |first=Harrison |date=2017-12-12 |website=Boise Weekly |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennial Avant Garde Puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseartsandhistory.org/blog/2017/12/20/creators-makers-and-doers-homegrown-theatre/ |title=Puppetry, Pantomime, &amp; Projections: HomeGrown Theatre's Shortcut to Spectacle |last=Burton |first=Brooke |date=2017-12-20 |website=Boise City Department of Arts &amp; History |access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Technological advances gave rise to residual payments, and their evolution can be traced in terms of those technologies.

===Radio===
Residuals were established in [[Radio in the United States|U.S. network radio]]. [[Live radio]] programs with nationwide audiences were generally performed either two or three times to account for different [[time zone]]s between the east and west coasts of the United States. The performers were paid for each performance. After audio "[[transcription disc]]" technology became widely available in the late 1930s, it was initially used to make recordings to send to radio stations that were not connected to the live network. As sound quality improved, radio networks began using them for time-delaying west coast broadcasts, eventually eliminating the need for multiple performances. The performers were kept on standby and paid for a second performance in case there were technical problems. This established the precedent for residual payments from recorded performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=5 August 2007
|accessdate=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the early 1950s, a similar transition occurred in television. Initially, most television broadcasts were either live performances or broadcasts of older films originally produced for theaters. [[Kinescope]] recordings were made of live east coast performances so they could be broadcast several hours later on the west coast, which also made it possible to broadcast these shows later as many times as they wanted. In 1952, residual payments were extended to these television [[rerun]]s, thanks in large part to [[Ronald Reagan]], whose first term as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) ran from 1947 to 1952.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Residual resentment slows Hollywood talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-residuals16oct16-story.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] negotiated residuals for up to five reruns for made-for-TV shows.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt;

That said, film actors were still not paid residuals for reruns. As Americans increasingly watched TV at home instead of going out to the movies, movie attendance plummeted by over 65% between 1948 and 1959, [[film studio|studios]] were grappling with decreased revenues, and actors felt like they were being deprived of significant income that was owed to them. The studios, however, took a hardline stance on residuals for movie actors due to their shrinking revenue as well as the fact that if they paid residuals to actors, they would also have to pay directors and [[screenwriter]]s as well.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federman|first1=Wayne|title=What Reagan Did for Hollywood|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/what-reagan-did-for-hollywood/248391/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stalemate led SAG actors to re-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] as SAG President in fall of 1959. Reagan asked SAG for a [[Strike action|strike]] authorization in February and the actors agreed on a work-stop date for March 7, 1960, Hollywood's first-ever industry-wide strike. Starting with [[Universal Pictures]], studios ended up agreeing to film residuals, but only for movies made after 1960s. They would issue a one-time payout of $2.25 million for movies made between 1948 and 1960, and movies made before 1948 would not be eligible for any residuals. (Unrelated to residuals, Reagan also secured [[health insurance]] and [[pension]]s for SAG actors.) This upset older actors like [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Bob Hope]], who blamed Reagan and the SAG board for weak negotiating, but in April 1960 SAG voted to accept the offer and returned to work.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

In 1988, WGA launched [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|its longest strike]], lasting 22 weeks, over a disagreement over residuals for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries. The new contract allowed writers two formulas for calculating foreign residuals: the existing formula ($4,400 maximum for a one-hour show) or the new formula (1.2% of the producer's foreign sales). On the other hand, domestic residuals were adjusted to take a sliding scale, which would incentivize producers to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicate]] one-hour shows, whose revenue performance was poor, to independent TV stations.&lt;ref name="nyt1988"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|title=Writers Ratify Contract, Ending Longest Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/movies/writers-ratify-contract-ending-longest-strike.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=8 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paramount front gate WGA strike Nov 12 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front gate of [[Paramount Studios]] on November 12, 2007, during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–08 WGA strike]]]]

In 2007, the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), the industry bargaining group that deals with the trade unions, called for an end to the current residual payment system in response to the rise of online media. Instead, it proposed that residuals be pooled so the studios would recoup their costs paying the actors, directors, and writers based on a profit-based formula,&lt;ref name="ciep"&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Cieply | first1 =Michael | title =Hollywood Officials Seek End to System Of Paying Residuals| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12hollywood-web.html |accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would solve the problem that residuals remain the same despite decreases in TV profits.&lt;ref name="handel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Residuals Revelation: Network Primetime Residuals as Chilly for SAG/AFTRA and DGA as WGA|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/residuals-revelation-network-primetime-residuals-214646|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) decided to negotiate for higher residual payments. The AMPTP adamantly opposed extending residuals to online movie and TV show sales for at least three years, citing the need to "adapt to the realities of the marketplace, the new demands from our audiences and new technologies",&lt;ref name = "latimes"/&gt; while a WGA representative countered that they "already had effective business models".&lt;ref name = "ciep"/&gt;

In 2011, SAG-AFTRA, WGA, and DGA negotiations kept residuals for network primetime TV (considered "among the most lucrative" residuals) frozen at previous levels.&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

== Process ==

Residuals are administered by the [[labor union|unions]]—[[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), and the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA)—for their members, who are paid between one and four months after the air date. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]], it processes around 1.5 million residual checks a year.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; WGA receives between 100 and 5,000 residual checks a day.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt; The DGA processes "hundreds of thousands of checks" a year, and in 2016 it processed $300 million in residuals for its members.&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;{{cite web|title= Residuals |url=https://www.dga.org/The-Guild/Departments/Residuals.aspx|website=Directors Guild of America |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual calculation is complex and depends on several variables, including guild membership, initial payment, time spent, type of production (e.g., network TV, DVD, ad-supported streaming, online purchases), and whether it involves a domestic or foreign market. Additionally, residuals change a lot: guilds negotiate new contracts with the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|AMPTP]] every three years, and residuals for primetime TV tend to increase every year because they are "directly or indirectly keyed to salary minimums, which increase several percent per year".&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

In acting, [[Extra (acting)|extras]] are generally not eligible, but [[stunt performer]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, singers, and actors with lines or scripted physical interactions with characters ("supporting actors" or "day players") are eligible.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residuals FAQ|url=https://www.sagaftra.org/content/residuals-faq|website=SAG-AFTRA|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal performers generally get larger residuals.&lt;ref name="market"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andres |first1= Tommy| title=How do actors make money off residuals?|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2014/10/24/business/ive-always-wondered/how-do-actors-make-money-residuals|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Marketplace|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the more prominent the actor, the more generous the residual. Big stars like [[Tom Cruise]], for example, would get a portion of DVD sales in addition to his "regular" residuals.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Internet Age|date=2011|publisher=Hollywood Analytics|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781438233857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZvLwaBN1uAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All "credited" writers are eligible for residuals, and the specific credit determines the amount of amount. For example, the "written by" credit yields a 100% residual allocation, "screenplay/teleplay by" yields a 75%, and "adaptation by" yields 10%.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{cite book|title=Residual Survivals Guide|date=October 2016|publisher=Writers Guild of America|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/members/finances/residualssurvival2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Not super relevant?
Disabled members are not supposed to have [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]) removed from their residuals. Some studios do comply if the disabled member contacts the movie studio, but there are other studios that choose to violate the IRS rule.
--&gt;
=== Examples ===
Residual payments can sometimes be very small if the role was small or the movie or show was not successful. For example, actor [[Jeff Cohen (actor)|Jeff Cohen]] received a residual check for $0.67 after appearing in one episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''; he took it to a former bar in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] called "Maeve's Re$iduals", which used to trade free drinks for any [[SAG-AFTRA]] residual checks for less than $1.&lt;ref name="bkstg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jeff|title=Calculating SAG Residuals| url= https://www.backstage.com/news/calculating-sag-residuals/|accessdate=3 February 2018 |work=Backstage|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Bob Gunton]], who played Warden Norton in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', noted that the movie, one of the most-rerun films, generated "close to six figures" in residuals for him in 2004, ten years after the movie was released, and even as of 2014, that he continued to receive "a very substantial income".&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=The Actors From 'Shawshank Redemption' Still Make A 'Steady' Income Off TV Residual Checks|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/actors-from-shawshank-redemption-residual-pay-2014-6|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Business Insider|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, actor [[Lisa Kudrow]] of ''[[Friends]]'' was ordered to pay $1.6 million to her former manager, who argued that he was owed 5% of Kudrow's residuals earnings from work that he negotiated.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title='Friends' Star Lisa Kudrow Loses $1.6 Million Lawsuit|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/friends-star-lisa-kudrow-loses-16-million-lawsuit/story?id=22681593|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=ABC News|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends star Lisa Kudrow must pay ex-manager $1.6m|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26381575|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=BBC|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using figures that were publicly disclosed, one analyst estimated Kudrow's residuals to be at least $2.3 million, and likely much higher.&lt;ref name="market"/&gt;

[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]

"'''Restoration comedy'''" is English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexually explicit language was encouraged by  [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian [[George Norman Clark]] argues:

{{quote|The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper....The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

==Theatre companies==

===Original patent companies, 1660–1682===
[[Image:Settle-Morocco.png|thumb|The sumptuously decorated Dorset Gardens playhouse in 1673, with one of the sets for [[Elkannah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''. The [[thrust stage|apron stage]] at the front which allowed intimate audience contact is not visible in the picture (the artist is standing on it).]] Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called [[letters patent|Royal patents]], to the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]], led by two middle-aged [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] playwrights, [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]]. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid [[patent theatre]]s in [[Drury Lane]] and [[Dorset Gardens]], respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by [[Christopher Wren]], both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by [[Ben Jonson]], and devoted themselves to the [[comedy of manners]], which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p194"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA194 pp.194, 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively [[noble court|courtly]], as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new [[genre]]s of [[heroic drama]], [[she-tragedy|pathetic drama]], and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Company, 1682–1695===
Both the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated ''United Company'' was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see [[Restoration comedy#Decline of comedy, 1678–90|Decline of comedy]] below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s, predatory investors ("Adventurers") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the theatres, 1695–1700===
The company owners, wrote the young United Company employee [[Colley Cibber]], "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support."&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers like the legendary [[Thomas Betterton]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]] had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors gained a Royal "licence to perform", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s famous ''Love For Love'' and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered [[Bartholomew Fair]]-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with "prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback".&lt;ref&gt;Dobrée, xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
===First actresses===
[[File:Nell gwyn peter lely c 1675.jpg|thumb|[[Nell Gwynn]] was one of the first actresses and the mistress of Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before [[London theatre closure 1642|the closing of the theatres]], all female roles had been taken by [[boy player]]s, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. [[Samuel Pepys]] refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.

Daringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare [[She-tragedy]].)

A new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the [[breeches role]], which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these [[cross-dressing]] roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional [[gender roles]] and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress [[Nell Gwyn]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]] who was famous for her ability to "move the passions" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. [[Susanna Verbruggen]]), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]].

===First celebrity actors===
[[Image:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Betterton]] played the irresistible Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[Man of Mode]].'' Betterton's acting ability was praised by [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Colley Cibber]].]]
During the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the [[thrust stage]].

With two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and [[Benefit concert|benefit nights]] as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.

The greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry ("Famous Mrs Barry" who "forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory") and [[Thomas Betterton]], both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.

Betterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton "did the prince's part beyond imagination." Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]], at the première of [[George Etherege]]'s ''Man of Mode'' (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and ''de facto'' day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.

==Comedies==
Variety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the "Restoration drama" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.

[[File:John Lacy by John Michael Wright 1668-70.png|thumb|upright|[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] was the favourite comic of King Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of [[Aphra Behn]] in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing ''The Country Wife'' (1675) and ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being "typical" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.

===Aristocratic comedy, 1660–1680===
The drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of [[Molière]]; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), which has one heroic verse "conflict between love and friendship" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (''See illustration, top right''.) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by [[postmodern]] academic critics.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675). [[Image:William Wycherley.png|thumb|[[William Wycherley]], ''[[The Country Wife]]'': "O Lord, I'll have some china too. Good Master Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none. Come in with me too."]]

====Example. William Wycherley, ''The Country Wife'' (1675)====
''[[The Country Wife]]'' has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:

1. Horner's [[impotence]] trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the "China scene", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained [[double entendre]] [[dialogue]] purportedly about Horner's china collection. ''The Country Wife'' is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.

2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's ''[[School for Wives]]''. Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's [[pathological jealousy]] always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the [[wit]]ty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.

===Decline of comedy, 1678–1690===
When the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]] (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|Tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]]. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.

===Comedy renaissance, 1690–1700===
During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. [[Thomas Southerne]]'s dark ''[[The Wives' Excuse]]'' (1691) is not yet very "soft": it shows a woman miserably married to the [[fop]] Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this "comedy" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.

In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the  "wit duels" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''The Way of the World'' (1700). Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's ''Wives' Excuse'', with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.

====Example. John Vanbrugh, ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697)====
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Vanbrugh]], ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'': "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."]]
''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]] (see Stone).

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."

Bellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.

''The Provoked Wife'' is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.

After a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.

===End of comedy===
The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.

==After Restoration comedy==
===Stage history===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's ''The Country Wife'' and ''The Plain-Dealer'', Etherege's ''The Man of Mode'', and Congreve's ''Love For Love'' and ''The Way of the World''  have competition not only from Vanbrugh's ''The Relapse'' and ''The Provoked Wife'', but from such dark, unfunny comedies as [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Wives Excuse''. Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with ''The Rover'' now a repertory favourite.

===Literary criticism===
Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like [[William Hazlitt]], although valuing the linguistic energy and "strength" of the [[wiktionary:canon|canonical]] writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor [[Montague Summers]], whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.

"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'', long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. "Minor" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: [[Delarivier Manley]], [[Mary Pix]], [[Catharine Trotter]], and [[Susannah Centlivre]]. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the [[British Library]].

'''Retention of vision''' is a [[conjuring]] term referring to the [[visual perception|perceived image]] of an object during a vanish (usually associated with vanishing coins).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In a [[retention of vision vanish]], the spectator sees a coin placed on a palm and as the fingers are closed around the coin it is secretly removed, but because the retina still retains a fleeting image of the coin for a fraction of a second, the spectator will be convinced that the coin was placed in the hand, when in fact it wasn't.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Roller derby''' is a [[contact sport]] played by two teams of five members [[roller skating]] counter-clockwise around a track. Roller derby is played by approximately 1,250 [[amateur]] leagues worldwide, mostly inside the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moffett |first=Matt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324610504578278171721339976?fb_action_ids=10152543496805385&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582 |title=As the World Turns, So Do the Wheels of Roller Derby |website=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-02-03|accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting their own jammer—in effect, playing both [[offense (sports)|offense]] and [[defense (sports)|defense]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnFddETifY8 |title=Common Ground: the alternative sport of roller derby |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930s, [[Leo Seltzer]] and [[Damon Runyon]] are credited with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of [[sports entertainment]], where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D01D520xcws |title=Roller Derby: The Fastest Growing Sport In America |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Rick (24 June 2008).

Contemporary roller derby has a basic set of rules, with variations reflecting the interests of a [[#Associations and governing bodies|governing body]]'s  member leagues. The summary below is based on the rules of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).&lt;ref name="WFTDARules"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rules of Flat Track Roller Derby|url=https://rules.wftda.com/|publisher=Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA)|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, [[Derby News Network]] claimed that more than 98% of roller derby competitions were conducted under WFTDA rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/2010/03/dnn_releases_first_power_rankings_2010|title=DNN Releases First Power Rankings of 2010|publisher=Derby News Network|date=2010-03-05|accessdate=2011-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201041743/http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/2010/03/dnn_releases_first_power_rankings_2010|archive-date=2011-12-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, members of the [[United Kingdom Roller Derby Association]] are required to play by WFTDA rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrda.org.uk/?page_id=12|title=Join Us|publisher=United Kingdom Roller Derby Association|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while members of the former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association were encouraged to join the WFTDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwrda.ca/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510105027/http://www.cwrda.ca/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-05-10|title=Welcome to CWRDA|publisher=Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association|accessdate=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Two teams of up to 15 players each field up to five members for episodes called "jams." Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the "jammer"); the other four members are "blockers." One blocker can be designated as a "pivot"—a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

During each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another "trip" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any member of the opposing team.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The rules describe an "earned" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that opponent and a point for each opponent not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack and the opposing jammer too, it is a five-point scoring trip, commonly called a "grand slam."

Each team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.

===Jams===
[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]
Play begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the "jammer line" and the "pivot line" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|12}} Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.

[[File:Texas Roller Derby Lonestar Rollergirls.jpg|thumb|Lonestar Rollergirls in Austin, Texas, play on a banked track. The jammer (wearing the starred helmet cover) is trying to pass a pivot (wearing a striped cover) with various blockers assisting.]]
The pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of  it, an area known as the "engagement zone."&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

The first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of "lead jammer."&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|7}} A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.

===Blocking===
[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]
A skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Penalties===
[[File:Roller derby, Amsterdam Derby Dames against the Ruhr Pott Roller Girls from Essen, Germany.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A German pivot attempts to knock a Dutch jammer out of bounds (the yellow line) at a 2011 bout held in [[Essen, Germany]].]]
Referees penalize rules violations.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|36}} A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a [[penalty box]] for 30 seconds of jam time.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|29}} If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|30}} The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in [[ice hockey]].

However, the "power jam", derived from hockey's [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|"power play"]], does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://svrollergirls.wordpress.com/roller-derby-a-glossary/|title=Roller derby: A glossary|publisher=Silicon Valley Roller Girls|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, that team cannot score.  While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.

It would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|31}} A player "fouls out" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|32}}

===Equipment===
Players skate on four-wheeled ("quad") roller skates,&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

==Strategy and tactics==
Offense and defense are played simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&amp;nav}}&lt;/ref&gt; a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics. For example, blockers may create a large hole for their jammer to pass through and score, but this same maneuver might also allow the opposing team's jammer to score.&lt;ref name="vodoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vodoo|first=Big Daddy|title=Roller Derby Strategies and Plays|url=http://bigarmy.net/index.php?topic=74.0|publisher=Little City Roller Girs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&amp;pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strategy|Strategies]] (high-level plans toward achieving the game's goal, which is to outscore the opposition) include the following:
*'''Ending the jam''': The lead jammer can "call off" or end the jam at any time, controlling the opposition's ability to score points. The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.
*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may "pass the star" (may perform a "star pass") to the pivot—that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position – Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as "passing the panty", as helmet covers are sometimes known as "panties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.&lt;ref name="LearnPivot" /&gt;

[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:
*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a "wide stance" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt; The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:
**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.
**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.
[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]
*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:
**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.
**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.
**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.
**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360°) to end up forward of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming – Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].
**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&amp;pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.
*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|11}} In the "goat-herding" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team, and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.
*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.&lt;ref name=western-style&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officials==
WFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|35}} and many non-skating officials (NSOs). Referees skate on the inside of the track; in flat-track derby, some also skate on the outside of the track. They call penalties, award points, and ensure safe game play.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|36}}  Referees must wear skates and typically wear white and black stripes.&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|38}} NSOs take up a range of positions inside and outside the track, start and time the jams, record and display scores and penalties communicated by referees, record the number of each skater on track for a given jam, and time and record skaters in the penalty box. Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.

===Evolution to contact sport===
The endurance races began to transform into the contemporary form of the sport in the mid-1930s, when promoter [[Leo Seltzer]]{{#tag:ref | Sources disagree on whether it was Leo alone or with his brother, the skate maker Oscar Seltzer.&lt;ref name=SF-book-79&gt;{{Cite book|title=San Francisco Bizarro: A Guide to Notorious Sights, Lusty Pursuits, and Downright Freakiness in the City by the Bay|last=Boulware|first=Jack|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-20671-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/07.24.97/rollerqueen-9730.html|title=Blood on the Tracks|last=Luker|first=Kelly|date=1997-07-23|accessdate=2008-07-13|newspaper=Metro Santa Cruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}{{#tag:ref | "Roller derby has entertained the masses in one form or another since the 1930s, when brothers Leo and Oscar Seltzer conceptualized the idea of a skating contest on a Chicago restaurant tablecloth."&lt;ref name="SF-book-79" /&gt;|group="note"}} created the Transcontinental Roller Derby, a month-long simulation of a road race between two-person teams of professional skaters.&lt;ref name="rasmussen"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|date=1999-02-21|title=L.A.

===Television===
On November 29, 1948, before television viewership was widespread, ''Roller Derby'' debuted on New York [[television]].&lt;ref name=dedford /&gt;{{rp|89}} The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches.&lt;ref name="rushin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014779/index.htm |title=A Forward Roll: Dusted off and spiffed up, the Roller Derby is aiming to regain the hold it once had on TV |date=1998-12-14 |periodical=Sports Illustrated |last1=Rushin |first1=Steve |author-link=Steve Rushin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908040817/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014779/index.htm |archive-date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2018-04-24 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1949–1950 season, Seltzer formed the [[National Roller Derby League]] (NRDL), comprising six teams.&lt;ref name="KTVU"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dedford /&gt;{{rp|95}} NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week.&lt;ref name="KTVU" /&gt; During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. [[Jerry Seltzer]] (Leo's son), the ''Roller Derby'' "commissioner", hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base. He adapted the sport for television by developing scripted story lines and rules designed to improve television appeal, but derby's popularity declined.&lt;ref name=dedford&gt;{{cite book|last=Deford|first=Frank|title=Five Strides on the Banked Track: The Life and Times of the Roller Derby|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1971|isbn=0-316-17920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1989 saw the debut of ''[[RollerGames]],'' an even more theatrical variant of roller derby for national audiences. It used a figure-8 track and rules adapted for this track. Bill Griffiths, Sr. served as commissioner while his son, Bill Griffiths, Jr., managed the L.A. T-Birds, who (according to the storyline) were seeking revenge on the Violators (led by Skull) for cheating in the Commissioner's Cup. The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez). It ran one season, because some of its syndicators went bankrupt.

In 1999, [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] (now [[Spike TV]]) debuted ''[[RollerJam]],'' which used the classic rules and banked oval track, but allowed inline skates (although some skaters wore traditional quad skates). Jerry Seltzer was commissioner for this version.

Most players in roller leagues skate under pseudonyms, also called "[[derby name]]s" or "skater names." These typically use [[word play]] with satirical, mock-violent or sexual [[pun]]s, [[alliteration]], and allusions to [[popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Referees#Roller derby|Referees]] use derby names as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.derbynewsnetwork.com/blogs/justice_feelgood_marshall/2008/12/killbox_retires_sort|title=Killbox retires (sort of)|publisher=[[Derby News Network]]|author=Tracy "Justice Feelgood Marshall" Williams|date=2008-12-08|accessdate=2008-12-30|journal=&amp;mdash;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225211439/http://derbynewsnetwork.com/blogs/justice_feelgood_marshall/2008/12/killbox_retires_sort|archive-date=2010-12-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often shown on the backs of their striped uniforms.

Whether a team should skate under real names or derby names is sometimes debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverrollerdolls.org/index.php/teams/mile-high-club/|title=Denver Roller Dolls—Teams—Mile High Club|accessdate=2009-07-19|quote=This season, 13 of the team's members are making the switch from derby names to real names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some derby names are obscene, and this attracts controversy among other skaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbylife.com/articles/2011/09/derby_names_not_ready_prime_time |title=Derby Names: Not Ready for Prime Time |website=DerbyLife.com |date=2011-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copying of derby names has attracted legal and sociological analysis as an example of indigenous development of property rights.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt; New players are encouraged to check derby names against an international roster to ensure they are not already in use.&lt;ref name=twoevils1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://derbyrollcall.com Derby Roll Call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821140439/http://www.derbyrollcall.com/ |date=2018-08-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of roller derby events are also sardonic and convoluted—for example, Night of the Rolling Dead ([[Night of the Living Dead]]), Knocktoberfest ([[Oktoberfest]]), Spanksgiving ([[Thanksgiving]]), Seasons Beatings ([[Christmas and holiday season|Seasons Greetings]]), Grandma Got Run Over By a Rollergirl ([[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]), Cinco de May-hem ([[Cinco de Mayo]]), and War of the Wheels ([[The War of the Worlds|War of the Worlds]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasurevalleyrollergirls.net/news.html |title=Treasure Valley Rollergirls |publisher=Treasure Valley Rollergirls |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724112536/http://www.treasurevalleyrollergirls.net/news.html |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
[[File:DerbySpiralFractureFIXED.JPG|thumb|[[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s and others tend to an injured skater.]]
Roller derby is a contact sport, and injuries can occur. Superficial injuries include torn eyelashes and "fishnet burn", a stippled effect of falling while wearing fishnet hose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Roller Derby Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc.|last=Wilson|first=Tracy|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/roller-derby6.htm|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, torn ligaments, broken bones, and [[concussion]]s also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Some leagues prominently display their injuries, to embellish the image of violence or [[machismo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ratcityrollergirls.com/injuries.html |title=Injury Gallery |publisher=Rat City Rollergirls |accessdate=2008-06-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026040642/http://www.ratcityrollergirls.com/injuries.html |archivedate=2007-10-26|deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.mnrollergirls.com/photos/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814113205/http://www.mnrollergirls.com/photos/index_SIMPLE.php?album=Pabst_Bruise_Gallery |archivedate=2007-08-14 |title=Pabst Bruise Gallery |publisher=Minnesota RollerGirls |accessdate=2008-06-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some skaters say the sport is reasonably safe if skaters take precautions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules require appropriate medical professionals on-site at every bout,&lt;ref name="WFTDARules" /&gt;{{rp|39}} even if not required by laws or arena regulations. The WFTDA offers insurance for leagues in the United States with legal liability and accident coverage, but it recommends that skaters also carry their own primary medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wftda.org/resources/insurance|title=WFTDA Insurance Program|publisher=WFTDA|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
Although the early 2000s revival of roller derby was initially all-female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams and unisex games; {{as of|2013|05|lc=yes}} there were over 140 [[junior roller derby]] programs in the United States, and many more around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyroster.com/index.php|title=Roller Derby Worldwide|access-date=2013-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111173106/http://www.derbyroster.com/index.php|archive-date=2013-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller derby bouts are now [[Streaming media|streamed]] online, and there is archived video of past bouts and tournaments. The WFTDA offers live streaming video of its tournaments at &lt;code&gt;wftda.tv&lt;/code&gt;. [[Derby News Network]] (&lt;code&gt;www.DerbyNewsNetwork.com&lt;/code&gt;) offered live streaming video and archived video including events outside the WFTDA.

FiveOnFive magazine covers roller derby and diverse aspects such as business, training, junior roller derby, and nutrition.&lt;ref name="FiveOnFive Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveonfivemag.com/|title=fiveonfive » women’s flat track roller derby magazine|website=Fiveonfivemag.com|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and organization==
{{Main article|List of roller derby associations}} 
The largest governing body for the sport is the [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] (WFTDA), with 397 full member leagues and 48 apprentice leagues.&lt;ref name="WFTDA Member Leagues"&gt;{{Cite web |title=WFTDA Leagues |publisher=WFTDA |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-08 |url=https://wftda.com/wftda-leagues/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFTDA membership is a major goal of aspiring leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It modifies the WFTDA rules for minors, such as prohibiting hitting and accelerating into a block.&lt;ref name="Junior Roller Derby Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juniorrollerderby.org/|title=HOME|website=Junior Roller Derby Association|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. leagues decline affiliation with a [[USA Roller Sports|national organization]] because they prefer local governance.&lt;ref name=rejected&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wftda.com/files/usars-reqest-for-endorsement.pdf|author=USA Roller Sports|title=To Whom It May Concern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026094549/http://wftda.com/files/usars-reqest-for-endorsement.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wftda.com/press/open-letter-to-usars|title=Open Letter to USA Roller Sports|publisher=Women's Flat Track Derby Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010173737/http://wftda.com/press/open-letter-to-usars |archivedate=2011-10-10|accessdate=2012-02-04|date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. WFTDA and USARS maintain a reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes.&lt;ref name=reciprocity-agreement&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usarollersports.org/roller-derby/usars-wftda-reciprocity|accessdate=2011-10-12|publisher=USA Roller Sports |date=2009-06-24 |title=USARS / WFTDA Reciprocity |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006141048/http://usarollersports.org/roller-derby/usars-wftda-reciprocity|archivedate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the [[United States]], many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations, such as [[Skate Australia]],&lt;ref name=skate-australia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skateaustralia.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=273 |title=Ballarat Junior Roller Derby Star Set for Battle |author=Rachel Afflick |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007142434/http://www.skateaustralia.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=273 |archivedate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Roller Sports Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roller Derby is now recognised as a sport in the UK, and UKRDA the National Association|url=http://www.euroderby.org/news/125-roller-derby-is-now-recognised-as-a-sport-in-the-uk-and-ukrda-the-national-association|website=Euroderby.org|accessdate=2011-10-02}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roller Sports Canada]].&lt;ref name=skate-Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollersports.ca/roller-derby/|title=Roller Derby|date=2010-01-07 |website=Rollersports.ca|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, roller derby was recognized as a sport in Paris in 2010 by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), which reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017, FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. Teams competed under the FIRS rules at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China.&lt;ref name="rollersports.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersports.org/|title=Rolling Up to Tokio 2020|website=Rollersports.org|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.&lt;ref name=rdaf-can&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Roller Derby Association of Canada |accessdate=2011-10-12 |title=Welcome to the CWRDA |url=http://www.cwrda.ca/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026035120/http://www.cwrda.ca/ |archivedate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tournaments===
Since 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008, it took the current [[WFTDA Championship|"Big 5"]] format: four regional playoffs and a final championship tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE BIG 5 WFTDA SPONSORED TOURNAMENTS |url=http://wftda.com/The-Big-5 |publisher=WFTDA |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115205158/http://wftda.com/The-Big-5|archivedate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFTDA also recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WFTDA Recognized Events|url= http://wftda.com/events|publisher=WFTDA|accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the first [[Roller Derby World Cup]] took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood &amp; Thunder Roller Derby World Cup 2011|url=http://bloodandthundermag.com/WorldCup2011.htm|publisher=Blood &amp; Thunder Magazine|accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014 Roller Derby World Cup|second World Cup]] took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas to Host 2014 Roller Derby World Cup|url=http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/2013/06/10/dallas-to-host-2014-roller-derby-world-cup/|publisher=Blood &amp; Thunder Magazine|date=2013-06-10|accessdate=2014-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214162640/http://www.rollerderbyworldcup.com/2013/06/10/dallas-to-host-2014-roller-derby-world-cup/|archive-date=2014-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017, FIRS and the USOC recognized USARS to participate in the Nanjing games.&lt;ref name="rollersports.org"/&gt;

==Social significance==
Zaina Arafat asserts in ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' that roller derby defies [[heteronormativity]] and patriarchal standards. In [[Egypt]], Arafat says, there are expectations that a woman will not show visible scars, will have an unblemished body for her husband, and will refrain from activities that may damage her body. She says roller derby in Egypt is subversive, as it acts as an indirect political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Arafat, Zaina, "POWER JAM: Roller Derby as Political Act", ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]],'' vol. 93, no. 3, Summer2017, pp. 36-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carly Giesler states that skaters enact sexualities that create or reclaim an identity, and their role parodies "hegemonic scripts of sexuality" through the use of costumes, derby names and personas. Roller derby acts as a unique stage for female athletes, letting them rebut constraints society places on women and female athletes. Giesler argues that female sports objectifies them for the [[Male gaze|male gaze]], but roller derby turns this on its head by disregarding gender roles and norms.&lt;ref name="gieseler"&gt;Gieseler, Carly. “Derby Drag: Parodying Sexualities in the Sport of Roller Derby.” Sexualities, vol. 17, no. 5-6, 2014, pp. 758–776., doi:10.1177/1363460714531268.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

Sometimes fields studying degrees of seriousness overlap, such as developmental psychology studies of development of the sense of degrees of seriousness as it relates to transgressions, which has overlap with criminology and the seriousness of crimes.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Set-jetting''' is the trend of traveling to destinations that are first seen in movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cosypursuits.com/2017/06/17/set-jetting-location-vacations-book-tourism-detective-travel/|title=Set Jetting, Location Vacations, Book Tourism &amp; Detective Travel|date=2017-06-17|website=Cosy Pursuits|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also referred to as a "Location Vacation". Touring [[London]] in a high-speed boat like [[James Bond]], or visiting the stately homes that are seen in the [[Jane Austen in popular culture|Jane Austen films]] are good examples. 

The term was first coined in the US press in the ''[[New York Post]]'' by journalist [[Gretchen Kelly]].&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/set_jetting_2IA9GEMZ2VSWSoDH5qdZ9M|title=Set Jetting|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=2009-11-05 | date=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis about the use of Geospatial technologies in setjetting was proposed by [[Thierry Joliveau]] in [[The Cartographic Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Connecting Real and Imaginary Places through Geospatial Technologies: Examples from Set-jetting and Art-oriented Tourism|url = http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/000870409X415570|journal = The Cartographic Journal|date = 2009-02-01|issn = 0008-7041|pages = 36–45|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1179/000870409X415570|first = Thierry|last = Joliveau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations, convention and tourism boards are exploiting the trend, creating their own set-jetting travel maps, like the ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'' movie map published by VisitBritain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitbritain.us/campaigns/film/index.aspx?url=/movies|title=Movie Map|work=visitbritain.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617071016/http://www.visitbritain.us/campaigns/film/index.aspx?url=%2Fmovies|archivedate=17 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205150218/http://www.visitbritain.us/Images/Golden%20Age%20Map%20FINAL_tcm20-114120.pdf Elizabeth the Golden Age].

'''The Late Shows''' are a one weekend annual cultural initiative developed in Tyne &amp; Wear since 2007. They are intended to attract new audiences to museums and galleries. They have become the largest programme&lt;ref&gt;http://tyneandwear.sky.com/events/article/20818/the-late-shows-artists-limber-up-for-after-dark-events India Adams reporting in 2012 for Sky "the UK's largest Museums at Night event".&lt;/ref&gt; organised in the United Kingdom for the '[[Museums at Night]] Festival'.

[[File:The Late Shows on teeshirts.jpg|thumb|right|The Late Shows on teeshirts]]

==History==

The programme started as a one-night event with 14 cultural venues taking part including [[Discovery Museum]], [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]] and the [[Laing Art Gallery]]. All the venues stayed open late and put on free events and exhibitions, which aimed to entice a new, younger audience through their doors. From the outset many different agencies came together to open their doors and this has continued. In mid-May 2013, more than 50 attractions feature  in what an arts site for the region describes as "The North East’s legendary culture crawl, The Late Shows".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accentmagazine.co.uk/ArticleDetail.aspx?id=2692 Accent the Look of the North&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Arts Council of England]] case study demonstrates its impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/funded-projects/case-studies/late-shows/&lt;/ref&gt; That report gives headline information thus "In 2009, 54 events held over two nights across the 29 venues taking part attracted 15,116 visitors. This involved nine commissions, 126 artists and four education sessions. The total audience, including print, broadcast and online was 701,800. The Late Shows 2010 has built on that success with over 19,500 people heading to NewcastleGateshead's museums and galleries after-hours. We supported The Late Shows with £25,000 of National Lottery funding from our Grants for the arts scheme. Support from other partner organisations included £39.974 from Culture 10, £8,703 from North East Regional Museums Hub and £17,990 of support in kind from the participating venues". In 2013 The Late Shows were a bronze award winner at the North East England Tourism awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/corporate/what-we-do/tourism-awards Tourism Awards 2013 retrieved 17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Titan Games''''' is an upcoming sports competition series set to air on [[NBC]]. Hosted by [[Dwayne Johnson]], the show will feature people from across the United States competing in an arena against one of six reigning "Titans" in a series of endurance-based mental and physical challenges of "epic proportions". If successful, the competitor will become a member of the group of Titans, who will have to defend their title every week against new competitors in order to remain in the group. The season finale will feature the remaining Titans challenge one another to determine the last male and female standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Teams Up with Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia to Launch Groundbreaking New Athletic Competition "The Titan Games," Featuring Johnson|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2018/02/04/nbc-teams-up-with-dwayne-johnson-and-dany-garcia-to-launch-groundbreaking-new-athletic-competition-the-titan-games-featuring-johnson-588501/20180204nbc02/|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=12 March 2018|date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format is similar to that of ''[[American Gladiators]]'' and its [[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|2008 remake]].

'''''Trivial Pursuit''''' is a [[board game]] from [[Canada]] in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer [[trivia|general knowledge]] and [[popular culture]] questions.

Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al tie-ins (such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movies).

The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in [[Quebec]], by Canadian [[Chris Haney (Trivial Pursuit)|Chris Haney]], a photo editor for Montreal's ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', and [[Scott Abbott]], a sports editor for ''[[The Canadian Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit History |publisher=ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding pieces of their ''[[Scrabble]]'' game missing, they decided to create their own game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_trivia_pursuit.htm |title=The History of '&amp;#39;Trivial Pursuit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"/&gt;

In [[North America]], the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of TRIVIAL PURSUIT|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm|website=The Great Idea Finder|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the game were initially licensed to [[Selchow and Righter]] in 1982, then to [[Parker Brothers]] (now part of [[Hasbro]]) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the [[Virgin Group]]; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/03/31/trivial-sale.html |title=Trivial Pursuit sells for a non-trivial sum: $80 million US |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of [[Elroy, Wisconsin]] produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the "Games Hall of Fame" by [[Games (magazine)|''Games'' magazine]]. An online version of ''Trivial Pursuit'' was launched in September 2003.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/092903.html |title=Trivial Pursuit Launches Online Version |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=29 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Trivialpursuit Token.jpg|thumb|A ''Trivial Pursuit'' playing piece, with all six wedges filled]]
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', these are [[Geography]] (blue), [[Entertainment]] (pink), [[History]] (yellow), Arts &amp; [[Literature]] (originally brown, later purple), [[Science]] &amp; [[Nature]] (green), and [[Sports]] &amp; Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.

Playing pieces used in ''Trivial Pursuit'' are round and divided into six sections, similar to a [[cheese spread|cheese triangle]]. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelfox|first1=Hilarie|title=Tried and tested family games for Christmas|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/13-board-games-keep-family-12326946|work=Huddersfield Examiner|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.

During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal "hub" space. At the end of each spoke is a "category headquarters" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say "roll again," giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a "wild" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

==Editions==
[[File:Trivial Pursuit.jpg|thumb|Board and pieces of Trivial Pursuit.]]
{{Main article|List of Trivial Pursuit editions}}
Over the years, numerous editions of ''Trivial Pursuit'' have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the ''Genus'' edition (or ''Genus I''). Several other general knowledge editions (such as ''Genus II'') have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.

In the United Kingdom, ''Trivial Pursuit'' players complained that the 2006 version of the game was "[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537151/Trivial-brain-teasers-enrage-games-fans.html |title=Trivial 'brain-teasers' enrage game's fans |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=17 December 2006 |first1=Beth |last1=Jones |first2=Julie |last2=Henry |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==

===Fred Worth lawsuit===
In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Super Trivia'', and ''Super Trivia II'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of ''Trivial Pursuit''. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and [[fictitious entry|deliberately placed misinformation]]. One of the questions in ''Trivial Pursuit'' was "What was [[Columbo (character)|Columbo]]'s first name?" with the answer "Philip". That information had been [[Fictitious entry|fabricated to catch]] anyone who might try to [[Copyright infringement|violate his copyright]].&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598%2C4685968| publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Courier]]| location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]| title=Trivial Suit| date=25 October 1984| last=Overend| first=William| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors of ''Trivial Pursuit'' acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the ''Trivial Pursuit'' inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the ruling.&lt;ref name=9cir&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Company |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=596 |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/827/569/3179/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worth asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to review the case, but the Court declined, denying [[certiorari]] in March 1988.&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Co. |vol=485 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=977 |date=1988 |url=http://wy.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac./SCT/1988/19880328_0041517.SCT.htm/qx}} (''cert. denied.'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Wall lawsuit===
In 1994, David Wall of [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]], launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.

Wall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a ''Trivial Pursuit''-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.

Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] ruled against Wall.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962864.htm |title=Hitchhiker loses Trivial Pursuit rights battle | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]] |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
{{See also|Trivial Pursuit (U.S. game show)||Trivial Pursuit (UK game show)|Trivial Pursuit: America Plays}}
A version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], aired on [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]] in the [[United States]] from 1993 to 1995 ([[Jay Wolpert]] had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version entitled ''[[Trivial Pursuit: America Plays]]'' aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In September 2004, [[Roger Lodge]] hosted a sports trivia game show on [[ESPN]] entitled ''ESPN Trivial Pursuit'', which aired five episodes.

[[BBC Television]] produced a ''Trivial Pursuit'' [[game show]] based on the game in the [[UK]] hosted by [[Rory McGrath]]. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on [[Challenge TV|The Family Channel (now Challenge)]] by [[Tony Slattery]]. [[Birgit Lechtermann]] hosted a version for [[VOX (TV channel)|VOX]] in [[Germany]] from 1993 to 1994.

In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled ''Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit'' aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of [[Jimmy Buffett]] and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.

In [[Spain]], a version of the show called ''Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays'' premiered in September 2008 on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]].&lt;ref name=antenna3&gt;{{cite news| title=Trivial deals, new gameshow for Debmar-Mercury| url=http://www.c21media.net/trivial-deals-new-gameshow-for-debmar-mercury/?ss=trivial+pursuit+spain| publisher=C21 Media| last=Grant| first=Jules| date=6 April 2008| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcade game===
In 1984, [[Bally Sente]] released a ''Trivial Pursuit'' arcade game.&lt;ref name=arcade&gt;{{cite web| title=Trivial Pursuit| url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10199| publisher=International Arcade Museum| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the board game, several variants were also released.

===Home computer games===
British software company [[Domark]] released a home computer version (billed as ''Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game'') for multiple formats during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="page6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.page6.org/archive/issue_26/page_24.htm |title=Issue 26 - Trivial Pursuit| publisher=Page 6| date=March–April 1987| last=Davison| first=John S. |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpcpower"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&amp;onglet=jaquette&amp;num=2297| title=Trivial Pursuit Edition Genus |publisher=cpc-power.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zxsoftware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|title=ZXSoftware.co.uk|publisher=ZXSoftware.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2012-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309145154/http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|archivedate=2013-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemon64"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3125 |title=Trivial Pursuit: Commodore-Genus Edition |publisher=Lemon64.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version included pictorial and musical questions&lt;ref name="ysorig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=November 1986 |first=Gwen |last=Hughes |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618224434/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |archive-date=2014-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.

Later, Domark released another version called ''Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning'', also across multiple formats.&lt;ref name="lemon64new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3475 |title=Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning |publisher=Lemon64.com |date=1988 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ysnew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |title=Trivial Pursuits - A New Beginning |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=January 1989 |first=Phil |last=South |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619011101/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |archive-date=2014-06-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version featured a plot about the dying Earth&lt;ref name="incredibly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incrediblystrangegames.com/post/1166003331/trivial-pursuit-a-strange-new-beginning |title=Trivial Pursuit: A Strange New Beginning |publisher=Incredibly Strange Games |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="ysnew"/&gt;

[[Hasbro Interactive]] released a "Millennium Edition" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:
*''Classic Pursuit'': Played just like the board game.  A "QUICKPLAY" option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question.  Up to six can play.  The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer.
*''Party Pursuit'': Up to three can play.  The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from.  A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category.  The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game.  After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players.
*''Point Pursuit'': Same as ''Party Pursuit,'' except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points.  Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question.  Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.

There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online game===
In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of ''Trivial Pursuit'' on the now-defunct website Uproar.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20031118005445/en/Trivial-Pursuit-Online-Games-Brings-Worlds-Popular|title=Trivial Pursuit Online Games Brings World's Most Popular Trivia Game to Uproar.com|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040204013755/http://www.uproar.com/promos/trivialpursuit/ Trivial Pursuit on Uproar]&lt;/ref&gt;where it features five editions such as: ''Genius'', ''Silver Screen'', ''Music'', ''1980s'' and ''TV''.

===Video games===
Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including [[Sega CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Trivial Pursuit|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ign.com/games/hasbro-game-channel-trivial-pursuit-live/ps4-20022843 Trivial Pursuit Live! on PlayStation 4], ign.com&lt;/ref&gt; The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called ''[[Trivia Crack]]''.

'''''Trivial Pursuit: Unhinged''''' is a [[video game]] based on the [[Trivial Pursuit|trivia board game of the same name]]. It was released in 2004 for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] video game consoles and Personal Computers.

==Game Modes==

===Classic Mode===

This mode is played exactly like the original board game.  Players take turns moving their pieces around the Trivial Pursuit board answering questions in six different categories to win one differently colored "pie piece" in each category.  The first player to collect all six "pie pieces" and answer a randomly selected question in the game board's hub is the winner.

===Unhinged===

The titular Unhinged mode is a variation of Classic mode where players can bet on their opponents' game performance and certain spaces on the game board are given different properties including:

Teleport - gives a player the ability to move their playing piece anywhere on the board&lt;br&gt;
50/50 - removed two incorrect answers from your four multiple choice answers&lt;br&gt;
Rotate - spins the board and moves all players to new positions&lt;br&gt;
Recycle - allows the player to swap their initial trivia question out for another if they do not feel they will get it right

}}

===Flash===

This mode is a quick two-player mode in which each player starts at the bottom of a tower and chooses a question in one of two random categories, each correct answer brings the player up a tier of the tower.  The first player to the top is declared the winner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''World Wide Telecom Web''' (also called as '''Spoken Web''' or '''Telecom Web''') is an initiative to create an alternate web for the under-privileged. It could help bridge the [[digital divide]] by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from [[World Wide Web]]. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing [[World Wide Web|Web]].&lt;ref name="WWTW"&gt;WWTW: The World Wide Telecom Web, In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networked Systems for Developing Regions (NSDR), August 2007, Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_person_subpage.php?id=1649 The World Wide Telecom Web -]&lt;/ref&gt;

WWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.&lt;ref name="WWTW"/&gt;

==How it works==
WWTW is a network of interconnected '''VoiceSites''' (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications ''created by'' users themselves and ''hosted'' in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.

Key enabler technologies include:

1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator

2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine

3. [[HSTP]] - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol

4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser

==Brief history==
World Wide Telecom Web was conceived by [http://researcher.ibm.com/view.php?person=in-kkarun Arun Kumar] at [[IBM]] [http://www.research.ibm.com/irl/ India Research Lab] during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/rajput.index.html Nitendra Rajput] in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and [[VoiceXML]] standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/chakraborty.index.html Dipanjan Chakraborty] and colleague Sandeep Jindal &amp; Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. [[C.K. Prahalad]] and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/nanavati.index.html Amit Anil Nanavati] got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a [http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/9fb1978638a52de5852572890036ddc2?OpenDocument Research Report]. Soon after [http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~sheetal2/ Sheetal K. Agarwal] joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/arun_kumar.wwtwpubs.html World Wide Telecom Web Publications].
This included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of [http://www2008.org/papers/pdf/p1123-agarwal.pdf Voikiosk] system conceived primarily by Nitendra.
