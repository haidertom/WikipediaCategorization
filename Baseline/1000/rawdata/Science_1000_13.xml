'''Anatomography''' is an interactive website which supports generating anatomical diagrams and animations of the [[human body]]. The Anatomography website is maintained by the DBCLS (Database Center for Life Science) non-profit research institute located at the [[University of Tokyo]]. Anatomical diagrams generated by Anatomography, and 3D polygon data used on the website (called BodyParts3D), are freely available under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license]].&lt;ref name="CREDIT"/&gt;

==Description==
Anatomography was launched on Feb. 9, 2009&lt;ref name="LAUNCH"&gt;[http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/info/userGuide/releaseNotes/index.html Release notes] (in Japanese).  DBCLS. Retrieved 2012-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; by founder and chief director Kousaku Okubo ([[:ja:大久保公策|大久保 公策]]), professor of the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] at the [[National Institute of Genetics]].

Human body polygon data used in the site are called "'''BodyParts3D'''".&lt;ref name="PMID18835852"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18835852|pmc=2686534|year=2009|last1=Mitsuhashi|first1=N|last2=Fujieda|first2=K|last3=Tamura|first3=T|last4=Kawamoto|first4=S|last5=Takagi|first5=T|last6=Okubo|first6=K|title=BodyParts3D: 3D structure database for anatomical concepts|volume=37|issue=Database issue|pages=D782–5|doi=10.1093/nar/gkn613|journal=Nucleic Acids Research}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; BodyParts3D polygon data are extracted from full-body [[MRI]] images. The MRI image set that BodyParts3D is based on is called "TARO". [[Taro (given name)|Taro]] is a common given name for males in Japanese, as [[John (given name)|John]] is in English. TARO is a 2mm * 2mm * 2mm [[voxel]] dataset of the human male created by the [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=14971769|year=2004|last1=Nagaoka|first1=T|last2=Watanabe|first2=S|last3=Sakurai|first3=K|last4=Kunieda|first4=E|last5=Watanabe|first5=S|last6=Taki|first6=M|last7=Yamanaka|first7=Y|title=Development of realistic high-resolution whole-body voxel models of Japanese adult males and females of average height and weight, and application of models to radio-frequency electromagnetic-field dosimetry|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–15|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/49/1/001}}&lt;/ref&gt; TARO was published freely on November, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0411/10/news106.html 日本人の数値人体モデルDB「TARO」と「HANAKO」公開 2004/11/10] (in Japanese).

National Institute of Information and Communications Technology. Retrieved 2012-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction process of BodyParts3D is as follows.&lt;ref name="PMID18835852"/&gt;
*Phase 1: Additional anatomical segmentations were introduced in the original TARO data. 
*Phase 2: Then, missing details were supplemented and blurred contours were clarified using a 3D editing program by referring to textbooks, atlases,&lt;ref name="RELEASE3.0"&gt;[ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/bodyparts3d/LATEST/release_3.0_e.html BodyParts3D Release Note (Release 3.0, 2011/6/20)] DBCLS. Retrieved 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and mock-up models by medical illustrators. 
*Phase 3: Further segmentation and data modification will continue in collaboration with clinical researchers until sufficient concept coverage is achieved.

BodyParts3D polygon data are distributed in the [[Wavefront .obj file|OBJ]] file format. The entire data file's size is 127 [[Megabyte|MB]] (polygon reduced) and 521 MB (high quality) as of version 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/en/bodyparts3d/download.html Download - BodyParts3D] DBCLS. Retrieved 2012-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of body parts (organs) registered in BodyParts3D is 1,523 as of version 3.0.&lt;ref name="RELEASE3.0"/&gt;

==Technical features==
BodyParts3D/Anatomography project uses the [[Foundational Model of Anatomy]] (FMA). The FMA is an open-source anatomical [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed and maintained by the Structural Informatics Group at the [[University of Washington]]. In BodyParts3D, each body-part is managed by an FMA identifier (FMAID) defined by the FMA. For example, the [[vertebral column]] is registered as ''[https://archive.is/20130218184836/http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/ag_annotation.cgi?i=FMA13478&amp;lng=en&amp;t=Conventional&amp;position=rotate FMA13478]'', the [[temporal lobe]] is registered as ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100116/http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/ag_annotation.cgi?i=FMA61825&amp;lng=en&amp;t=Conventional&amp;position=rotate FMA61825]'', and so on.

'''Arthur Good''' (16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue Général|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12058496c|website=BnF (nouvelle fenêtre)|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 1853 – 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name '''Tom Tit'''.  He wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages.  The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as [[surrealist]] [[collages]], and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].

== Personal life ==
Arthur Good was born in [[Montivilliers]], [[Seine-Maritime]], [[France]] on 16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"/&gt; August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Frédéric Good (1823–1896) and Louise Stéphanie Monod (1827–1909).&lt;ref name="Geneanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Good|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/bourelly?lang=fr&amp;p=arthur&amp;n=good|website=Geneanet|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufacture]] in [[Paris]], where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name="Chemineau" /&gt;

He married Jeanne Valon (1857–1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Geneanet" /&gt;

Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', for the French magazine ''L’Illustration''.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; Good presented a range of physical experiments, from "simple games meant to amuse the family" to experiments "of a truly scientific character". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles&lt;ref name="Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lachapelle|first1=Sofie|title=Conjuring Science: A History of Scientific Entertainment and Stage Magic in Modern France|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-49768-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB7eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[magnetism]] and [[surface tension]].&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elder|first1=R. Bruce|title=Dada, surrealism, and the cinematic effect|date=2013|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, Ont.|isbn=978-1-55458-625-7|pages=494–495|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhXaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good's articles include geometrical demonstrations, craft projects, and physics experiments which can be carried out with everyday household materials.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In books such as ''La Récréation En Famille'' he emphasized that scientific education could be a common activity and amusement for the entire family. He dedicated ''La Science Amusante'' to one of his children, saying "In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses".&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt;

Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his ''Soap-bubble Chandelier'' using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver [[Louis Poyet]] (1846–1913) and his assistants.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelman|first1=Eric|title=The Collaged World of Tom Tit|url=http://blog.retrocollage.com/collaged-world-tom-tit/|website=RetroCollage|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poyet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le graveur du dimanche * Louis Poyet|url=http://gonefishing.over-blog.com/article-le-graveur-du-dimanche-louis-poyet-48802161.html|website=Gone Fishing|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original columns from ''La Science Amusante'' were collected and published in a three-volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; they have been reprinted in over 130 editions.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt; Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In the United States they appeared as ''Magical Experiments, or Science in Play'', and in England as ''Scientific Amusements''. A selection has also been republished as ''100 Amazing Magic Tricks''.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt;  Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for  modern approaches to science education in their introduction of "kitchen science" and hands-on experiments for children.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buxton |first1=Cory A. |last2=Provenzo, Jr. |first2=Eugene F. |title=Teaching Science in Elementary and Middle School: A Cognitive and Cultural Approach |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aqDhzUdLS4C&amp;pg=PA44 |oclc=72353389 |isbn=978-1-4129-2497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic research''', also called '''pure research''' or '''fundamental research''', has the  [[scientific research]] aim to improve scientific theories for improved understanding or prediction of natural or other phenomena.&lt;ref name=Research2014avg&gt;{{cite web| title = What is basic research? | publisher = National Science Foundation| url = https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1953/annualreports/ar_1953_sec6.pdf| accessdate = 2014-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Applied research]], in turn, uses scientific theories to develop technology or techniques to intervene and ''alter'' natural or other phenomena. Though often driven by curiosity,&lt;ref name="NIGMS"&gt;[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Education/factsheet_CuriosityCreatesCures.htm "Curiosity creates cures: The value and impact of basic research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020130308/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Education/factsheet_CuriosityCreatesCures.htm |date=October 20, 2013 }}, [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]], [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;/ref&gt; basic research fuels applied science's innovations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsu.org/publications/icsu-position-statements/value-scientific-research "ICSU position statement: The value of basic scientific research"], International Council for Science, December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two aims are often coordinated in [[research and development]].

Basic research advances fundamental knowledge about the world. It focuses on creating and [[Falsifiability|refuting or supporting]] [[scientific theory|theories]] that explain observed phenomena. Pure research is the source of most new scientific ideas and ways of thinking about the world. It can be [[Exploratory research|exploratory]], [[Descriptive research|descriptive]], or explanatory; however, explanatory research is the most common.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Basic research generates new ideas, principles, and theories, which may not be immediately utilized but nonetheless form the basis of progress and development in different fields. Today's computers, for example, could not exist without research in pure mathematics conducted over a century ago, for which there was no known practical application at the time. Basic research rarely helps practitioners directly with their everyday concerns; nevertheless, it stimulates new ways of thinking that have the potential to revolutionize and dramatically improve how practitioners deal with a problem in the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the United States, basic research is funded mainly by federal government and done mainly at universities and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |title=Bell Labs kills fundamental physics research |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828233520/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html| archivedate= 28 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As government funding has diminished in the 2010s, however, private funding is increasingly important.&lt;ref name=NYT31514&gt;{{cite news|author1=William J.

== Basic versus applied science ==

[[Applied science]] focuses on the development of technology and techniques. In contrast, basic science develops scientific knowledge and predictions, principally in [[natural science]]s but also in other empirical sciences, which are used as the scientific foundation for applied science. Basic science develops and establishes ''information'' to predict phenomena and perhaps to understand nature, whereas [[applied science]] uses portions of basic science to develop ''interventions'' via technology or technique to alter events or outcomes.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/content/64/1/1.full#title4 |title=Limited scope of science}} &amp; "Technology" in {{cite journal |author=Bernard Davis |authorlink1=Bernard Davis (biologist) |pmid=10704471 |title=The scientist's world |journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] |date=Mar 2000  |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.64.1.1-12.2000 |pmc=98983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;{{cite journal |author=James McCormick |pmid=19790950 |pmc=2560978 |title=Scientific medicine—fact of fiction?

It conducted a study in which it traced the relationship between basic scientific research efforts and the development of major innovations, such as oral contraceptives and videotape recorders.  This study found that basic research played a key role in the development in all of the innovations.  The number of basic science research{{Clarify|Number of what: Studies?  The English-language expression of the thought whose conveyance was attempted here could be improved.|date=May 2017}} that assisted in the production of a given innovation peaked{{Clarify|Number of what: Studies?  The English-language expression of the thought whose conveyance was attempted here could be improved.|date=May 2017}} between 20 and 30 years before the innovation itself.  While most innovation takes the form of applied science and most innovation occurs in the private sector, basic research is a necessary precursor to almost all applied science and associated instances of innovation.  Roughly 76% of basic research is conducted by universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Economics Shapes Science|last=Stephan|first=Paula|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-674-04971-0|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=146|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bathometer''' (also '''bathymeter''') is an [[Scientific instrument|instrument]] for measuring water depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bathometer Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.nv.gov/programs/planning/dictionary/wwords-B.pdf Water Words Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously used mainly in [[Oceanography|oceanographical]] studies, but is rarely employed nowadays. The term originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''βαθύς'' (''bathys''), "deep" and ''μέτρον'' (''métron''), "measure".

'''''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium''''' is a 1997 book by the American [[astronomer]] and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]]. The last book written by Sagan before his death in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-679-41160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[Random House]].

==Overview==
The book is a collection of essays Sagan wrote covering diverse topics such as [[global warming]], the [[population explosion]], [[extraterrestrial life]], [[morality]], and the [[abortion debate]]. The last chapter is an account of his struggle with [[myelodysplasia]], the disease which finally took his life in December 1996. Sagan's wife, [[Ann Druyan]], wrote the epilogue of the book after his death.

=="Billions and billions"==
To help viewers of ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' distinguish between "millions" and "billions", Sagan stressed the "b". Sagan never did, however, say "[[q:Carl Sagan|billions and billions]]". The public's association of the phrase and Sagan came from a ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' skit. Parodying Sagan's affect, [[Johnny Carson]] quipped "billions and billions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions Carl Sagan takes questions more from his 'Wonder and Skepticism' CSICOP 1994 keynote, Skeptical Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221054208/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions |date=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has, however, now become a humorous fictitious number—the [[Sagan (number)|Sagan]].

'''''Biochemical Predestination''''' is a 1969 book by [[Dean H. Kenyon]] and [[Gary Steinman]] which argued in support of [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="affidavit"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Kenyon | first = Dean H. | title = Edwards v. Aguillard: Dean Kenyon's Affidavit | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/kenyon.html | publisher = [[TalkOrigins Archive]] | date = 17 September 1984 | accessdate = 1 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Kenyon and Steinman conclude that "Life might have been biochemically predestined by the properties of attraction that exist between its chemical parts, especially between amino acids in proteins."&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;{{citation|title=Unlocking the Mystery of Life|publisher=Illustra Media, a branch of the [[Discovery Institute]], and [[Focus on the Family]]|year=2002|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that life originated with the chemical properties of amino acids causing them to be attracted to each other, forming long protein chains, most important in every living cell. Kenyon believed that proteins were directly formed by attraction between amino acids without [[DNA]] coding, and that these were derivatives from non-living raw chemicals in a conducive environment.

In 1976 Kenyon was persuaded by the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] arguments of [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]].&lt;ref name="pandasthumb.org"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Dean Kenyon: a young-earth creation scientist who was later relabeled an intelligent design proponent - The Panda's Thumb | url = http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/07/dean-kenyon-a-y.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 1 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1982 foreword he wrote to ''What Is Creation Science?'' by [[Henry M. Morris]] and Gary Parker, Kenyon said that he no longer accepted the pro-evolution arguments in ''Biochemical Predestination''. At the ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' trial he provided an affidavit in support of [[creation science]] and noted the book as one of his publications. Kenyon subsequently became a co-author of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' which rebranded creation science as [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref name="affidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Forrest | first = Barbara | title = Expert Witness Report | url = http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/expert_reports/2005_04_01_Forrest_expert_report_P.pdf | publisher = [[National Center for Science Education]] | date = 1 April 2005 |pages=15–16 | accessdate = 1 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The theory propounded was summarized by Stephen Berry, a chemist; "describing the following causal chain: the properties of the chemical elements dictate the types of monomers that can be formed in prebiotic syntheses, which then dictate the properties of the occurring polymers, which finally dictate the properties of the first eobionts and all succeeding cells."&lt;ref&gt;"Biochemical Predestination" as Heuristic Principle for Understanding the Origin of Life" by Stephen Berry, ''J. Chem. Educ.'', 1997, 74 (8), p 950 {{doi|10.1021/ed074p950}} [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed074p950 Link]&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon's work was about virus production.&lt;ref&gt;"Prof Flips Theory Coin About Virus Production," ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', Wednesday, March 22, 1972. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
Intelligent design proponent [[Stephen C. Meyer]] says that the book provided a new approach which came to be known as "[[Self-organization]]".&lt;ref name="Meyer2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Stephen C.|title=Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laW5vuTLNXEC&amp;pg=PA229|date=23 June 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-147278-7|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyon began to doubt his theory in the mid-1970s after a student posed the question to him as to how the first proteins could have been assembled without specific genetic instructions.&lt;ref name="Colson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colson|first=Charles|title=How Now Shall We Live?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmlf9UnQa0EC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=14 July 2011|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4143-2242-1|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a fellowship at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley during the 1969-1970 academic year, he reviewed literature on the relationship of science and religion. He began to rethink his Christian faith, and  explored the topic further in a 1974 sabbatical at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1976, a student gave him a book by the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]], and "Eventually, several other books and articles by neo-creationists came to my attention. I read some of Henry Morris’ books, in particular, ''The Genesis Flood''. I’m not a geologist, and I don’t agree with everything in that book, but what stood out was that here was a scientific statement giving a very different view of earth history. Though the book doesn’t deal with the subject of the origin of life per se, it had the effect of suggesting that it is possible to have a rational alternative explanation of the past."&lt;ref name="pandasthumb.org" /&gt; In 1976 he wrote a new section for [[Henry M. Morris|Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|Whitcomb]]'s ''[[The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications]]''. In the 1982 foreword he wrote to ''What Is Creation Science?'' by Morris and Gary Parker, Kenyon said that he no longer accepted the pro-evolution arguments in ''Biochemical Predestination''. At the ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' trial he provided an affidavit in support of [[creation science]] and noted the book as one of his publications. Kenyon subsequently became a co-author of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' which rebranded creation science as [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref name="affidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''CrocBITE''' is an [[online]] [[database]] of [[crocodile]] attacks reported on humans. The [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] online research tool helps to scientifically analyze crocodile behavior via complex models. Users are encouraged to feed information in a [[crowdsourcing]] manner. The uploaded information needs to be verifiable. The database provides key insights into crocodile attack patterns and draws inferences to save human lives.

==About==
The online database was established in {{Start date|2013}} by Dr Adam Britton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Britton - Profile @RIEL|url=http://riel.cdu.edu.au/people/profile/adam-britton|website=riel.cdu.edu.au|publisher=[[Charles Darwin University]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a researcher at [[Charles Darwin University]], his student Brandon Sideleau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Profile|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brandon_Sideleau|publisher=[[ResearchGate]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erin Britton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erin Britton - profile|url=http://www.expeditions.com/why-us/expedition-team/staff-bio/erin-britton/|website=www.expeditions.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croc attacks: a new website with bite|url=http://theconversation.com/croc-attacks-a-new-website-with-bite-20671|website=www.theconversation.com|date=3 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compilation of government records, individual reports, registered contributors and historical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Crocodile attack database ‘will aid conservation efforts and save lives’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/25/crocodile-attack-database-aid-conservation-save-lives|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ack"&gt;{{cite web|title=CrocBITE - Acknowledgments|url=http://www.crocodile-attack.info/about/acknowledgments|website=www.crocodile-attack.info|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Simon Pooley, Junior [[Research fellow]], [[Imperial College London]] joined hands to further the studies. The collaboration culminated when Dr Pooley met Dr Britton at the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Crocodile Specialist Group, in [[Louisiana]] in 2014. Brandon was instrumental in designing the database and work on the [[Information technology|IT]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name="univarticle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Laura|title=Crocodile attack project could help save lives in vulnerable communities|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-12-2014-16-23-8|work=[[Imperial College London]]|date=12 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program received funds from [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[United Kingdom]] to the tune of {{A$|30000}}&lt;ref name="univarticle" /&gt; and unspecified resourced plus amount from Big Gecko Crocodilian Research, Crocodillian.com and Charles Darwin University.&lt;ref name="ack" /&gt;

The research already has yielded pertinent observations that provide inside into crocodile attacks. It was observed that most attacks on humans occur from bites of [[Saltwater crocodile]] as against the popular understanding of [[Nile crocodile]]s taking the top spot. The broad category of Nile crocodile attacks were segmented into [[West African crocodile]] and ''Crocodylus niloticus'' (the Nile Crocodile) species to get a clear understanding of their respective attack zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - CrocBITE|url=http://www.crocodile-attack.info/about/frequently-asked-questions|website=www.crocodile-attack.info|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective is that the information will used by communities and conservation managers to help inform and educate people about how to keep safe. The information is vital for [[Australia]] and [[Africa]] where such attacks are more likely than in other parts of the world. This is the only database of its kind with such comprehensive collection of information made available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCafferty|first1=Georgia|title=Australian MP blames 'human stupidity' for suspected fatal croc attack|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/30/asia/australia-croc-attack/|work=[[CNN]]|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature''', which opened in 1854, was set up by the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] as a new enterprise to occupy part of its buildings when it  re-erected the Crystal Palace in suburban [[Sydenham]] in 1853. Civil engineer and later first director of the [[Royal College of Music]], [[George Grove]] was appointed secretary. It was a part of the great movements for educational and social reform of the nineteenth century.

The main buildings were destroyed by fire in 1936.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Letter to The Editor, ''The Times'', Monday Dec. 07, 1936. page 10, issue 47551&lt;br&gt;
The end of the Crystal Palace brings to mind  memories of the School of Engineering which was housed  in the South Tower, fortunately still standing firm as a rock. This school, founded by J. W. Wilson, M.I.M.E., an engineer who helped to build the Great Exhibition of 1851, sent many of its students to the four quarters of the globe. The curriculum of the school included mechanical and civil courses and about five of the circular rooms were used. There was a fitting shop, pattern shop, and drawing office. Those in the mechanical section built a 4 h.p. vertical engine which was generally exhibited at the head of the stairs on the south side of the Palace. In the Civil Engineering section we surveyed the whole of the grounds, and drew plans and made estimates for an imaginary railway which extended from one side to the other. This entailed all the necessary estimates for embankments, a cantilever bridge etc. Then there was the Colonial section presided over by a most congenial superintendent, who had no doubt seen much of a pioneer's life and infused his enthusiasm into those who belonged to his section. Concerning the rigidity of the South Tower, I was working in a high storey soon after joining the school when there was a strong wind, and, feeling giddy, I mentioned it to the superintendent. He informed me that it rocked several inches at the top, which made it safer than absolute rigidity.–Mr F. C. Bell, 74, Berners Street, Ipswich.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Earthquake sensitivity''' and '''earthquake sensitive''' are [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] terms defined by [[Jim Berkland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to certain people who claim sensitivity to the precursors of impending earthquakes, manifested in "dreams or visions, psychic impressions, or physiological symptoms", the latter including "ear tones" ([[Ringing (medicine)|ringing in the ears]]), headaches, and agitation. It is claimed that "[a] person with a very sensitive body may also have some subtle reaction to whatever animals react to".&lt;ref&gt;Reneau Z. Peurifoy, quoted in {{Harvnb|Orey|2006|pp=65–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents have speculated&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that these may result from: 1) [[piezoelectric effect]]s due to changes in the stress of the earth's crust, 2) low-frequency electromagnetic signals, or 3) from the emission of [[radon]] gas.

Although proponents suggest the ''possibility'' that the claimed effects might work through known physical phenomena, and thus be amenable to scientific study, these claims are pseudoscientific&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|1997|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in that no evidence of such effects, nor any theory of how such effects might be perceived, has been presented in the scientific literature.  What the scientific literature does have is various reports showing that animals do ''not'' show disturbed or altered behavior attributable to earthquake precursors&lt;ref&gt;In several studies direct observation of animals showed no signs of anomalous animal behavior preceding an earthquake ({{Harvnb|Lighton|Duncan|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Kenagy|Enright|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Lindberg|Skiles|Hayden|1981}}). A study of anomalous animal behavior reported to a hotline ''prior'' to an earthquake found no significant increase ({{Harvnb|Otis|Kautz| 1979}}). A claim that advertisements for missing pets increase prior to an earthquake (also touted by Berkland as a means for predicting earthquakes &amp;#91;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=263}}&amp;#93;) was disproven by {{Harvtxt|Schaal|1988}}.
&lt;br /&gt;
Animals have been observed reacting to the P-waves that may arrive some tens of seconds before the more severe, but slower, S-waves. However, the P-waves do not precede the earthquake, but only the arrival of the S-waves at locations distant from an earthquake that has already happened.&lt;/ref&gt; (other than foreshocks &lt;ref&gt;Animals, like humans, do react to foreshocks. However, foreshocks are not reliable earthquake precursors: in some cases they are followed by a larger earthquake, but in many cases they are not, and as yet no way has been found to determine whether any cluster or swarm of small earthquakes will lead to an imminent, larger earthquake ({{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Brodsky|Lay|2014}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). Aside from whether such phenomena can be ''detected'' (by any means), the "consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zechar|Jordan|2008|p=723}}. {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}} had previously noted that "[e]xtensive searches have failed to find reliable precursors." A assessment in 2011 again noted that, despite a century of study, "[t]he search for diagnostic precursors has thus far been unsuccessful" ({{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}).&lt;/ref&gt; has led many scientists to question whether such precursor phenomena even exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Matthews|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Could "earthquake sensitives" be responding to some kind of "psychic impressions" or other paranormal phenomena as yet unknown to science? After reviewing the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF)&lt;ref&gt;A panel of internationally recognized earthquake experts convened at the request of the Italian government after the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake]].&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that {{quotation|there is no credible scientific evidence that animals display behaviors indicative of earthquake-related environmental disturbances that are unobservable by the physical and chemical sensor systems available to earthquake scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On their side, the proponents claim that there have been "many scientific papers" supporting their views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=29}}. {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=432}} and the {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2011|p=336}} reviewed a number of such papers. Such papers are generally collections of anecdotal reports that lack scientific validity. Geller describes them as "doubly dubious".&lt;/ref&gt; but "most have been totally rejected by the keepers of high wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=29}}. [[Susan Hough]], a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, notes "variations on a drumbeat theme that we are hegemonical, close-minded, unwilling to acknowledge or accept breakthroughs that come from outside the ranks." {{Harv|Hough|2010|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While scientists are quick to dismiss theories they "know, or have good reason to believe, are not credible",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially predictions by amateurs on account of their lack of scientific rigor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|p=165}}. In [[seismology]] an earthquake prediction must specify the ''time'', ''location'', and ''magnitude'' of a future earthquake with sufficient specificity that measures can be taken that will mitigate serious harm {{Harv|Geller|1997|p=425}}. Any evaluation of a prediction method must specify its failure rate as well as its success rate, with complete documentation of ''all'' predictions to avoid "cherry picking" of just the successful cases. To be deemed successful prediction methods must be statistically significant. That is, successful beyond random chance {{Harv|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992|p=32}}. Amateurs seldom understand the need for such rigor, and even scientists are occasionally criticized for being vague and ambiguous {{Harv|Geller|1996|p=436}}, or failing to consider alternative explanations (e.g., {{Harvnb|McClellan|1980}}). See [[Earthquake prediction]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;
proponents claim that successful predictions can indicate a significant breakthrough, even if the details are not understood.&lt;ref&gt;Berkland has said: "The only real test of the efficiency of a predictive method is: How close do future events correspond to the earlier extrapolations?" {{Harv|Berkland|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard Berkland claims "a 75 percent accuracy rate of forecasting quakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orey|2006|p=45}}. This statement is problematical. For seismologists ''forecasting'' usually means a probabilistic estimate of ''general'' earthquake hazard, of the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes in a given area, generally over periods of years or decades. ''Prediction'' is distinguished as a definite statement of the time and magnitude of the ''next'' earthquake expected in a given area. In this instance it appears that "forecast" is being used in the sense of ''prediction''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results (besides being disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hunter|2006}} analyzed Berkland's predictions, and found them no better than chance.&lt;/ref&gt;) are irrelevant in demonstrating any kind of "earthquake sensitive" effect as Berkland's predictions appear to not involve such effects.&lt;ref&gt;In 1990 Berkland described his method as the "Seismic Window Theory" (based on tidal stresses when the sun and moon are aligned, known as [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]) {{Harv|Berkland|1990}}. {{Harvtxt|Orey|2006|p=29}} described Berkland's method as the"Three Double G" system: 1) "the gravity gradient, or the forces exacted on the earth by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon." 2) "Gone Gatos" – missing cats, as indicated by advertisements in several newspapers. 3) "Geyser Gaps", seen as irregularities in the behavior of a geyser in the Napa Valley. {{Harvtxt|Hunter|2006}} found "a hodge-podge of factors", but apparently none of these involve human sensitivities of any kind.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkland ceased posting his predictions after June 2010. Though a few others have continued to post their predictions on Berkland's website, there appears to be no effort to correlate "ear tones" or any other physiological effect with subsequent earthquakes.

'''El Sueño de Arquímedes''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast by [[Radio Nacional de España|Radio Nacional de España (RNE)]] from September 2006 until June, 2007. The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 35 programs are still available for download. In addition to El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano also hosted [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]], which was broadcast weekly without interruption from April 1995 until June 2007. The name of the program means "the dream of [[Archimedes]]", and alludes to Archimedes' statement that given a [[lever]] and a fixed point, he could move the world. To Ángel Rodríguez Lozano, the dream was moving the world by popularizing and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano.] First published 30 June 2007.''"Arquímedes, lo que propuso fue que con una palanca podía mover el mundo. Para mi, El sueño de Arquímedes era simplemente mover el mundo divulgando y repartiendo conocimiento."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Before the startup of El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano had been hosting Vanguardia de la Ciencia for more than a decade. When RNE
asked if he would host a second popular science program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano realised that the scheduled timing, Sundays between 3 and 4 p.m, meant that it would be sandwiched between sports broadcasts. Therefore, he would have to capture the attention of listeners who were not looking for this type of program. The intention was therefore to make the program even more accessible than Vanguardia de la Ciencia, with shorter interviews and more music. Ángel Rodríguez Lozano stated that it had been a marvellous experience, and that the response had been tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ |title=¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano |publisher=Dimetu.com |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included science news, interviews, and biographies of great scientists, written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo]. In the final, humorous section of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano paid a visit to the archetypical [[mad scientist]]
[http://www.ciencia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d5391d7ca78deb60dc51e84fc79f34cf020766f1ed143c396b5d1b644b9b60d9d0e1aa0b6615df94332359e92d8b381cbb51cf1d8bab454cc Alejandro Laguna], who supposedly lived and worked in a hidden laboratory in the basements of Radio Nacional de España, seven floors below ground level. Alejandro would demonstrate one of his latest inventions, which usually defied the laws of physics, and Ángel played the role of a rather gullible spectator. Alejandro then explained the physics of the corresponding real-world device. Finally, the demonstration of his invention usually had some highly unpleasant consequence for Ángel.

==Termination of El Sueño de Arquímedes==

In June 2007, El Sueño de Arquímedes and Vanguardia de la Ciencia were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs of Vangurardia de la Ciencia, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Correspondence section at the end of the program [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]] of 9 June 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}

In the previously referenced interview, he explained that everyone older than 52 years had to retire early, and that he was 54 years old at the time.

[[File:Experiments 1751 color.jpg|thumb|upright 1.25 |Title page of 1751 original publication]]
''' ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity'' ''' is a mid-eighteenth century book consisting of letters from [[Benjamin Franklin]]. These letters concerned Franklin's discoveries about the behavior of electricity based on experimentation and scientific studies. The book came in [[pamphlet]] form for the first three English editions. The last two editions were in a book volume with hard covers and [[Bookbinding|a book spine]]. There were eleven European editions of the book: five English editions, three French editions, and a German, Italian and Latin edition. The publication was well received worldwide. It was considered America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century.

The book came about through the activities of scientists at the [[Royal Society]] of London. Franklin sent letters to members of the Society about his experiments on electricity and the observations he had made. Most of these letters went to [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]]. Some of these were read at the society's meetings. There was much interest shown, so some of them were sent to a printer to be published in a magazine. Public interest in Franklin's letters about electricity led the Society to gather together many of the letters to Collinson from Franklin over a two-year period and send them to the printer for publication. This first collection of letters was published in a ninety-page [[pamphlet]] in 1751. It was soon followed by other parts that were "Supplemental" to the existing edition and eventually a "New" publication was sold from the total of all the "Parts" produced. Each edition expanded by additional Franklin letters being added. It ultimately became a 496-page volume by 1769. The book inspired others to follow in Franklin's footsteps to do further in-depth research on electricity.

== Background ==

[[File:Franklin machine.jpg|thumb|upright 0.9|Franklin's electrostatic machine &lt;br /&gt; display at [[Franklin Institute]] museum.]]

Franklin was first attracted to the study of electricity when he saw the showman [[Archibald Spencer]] do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744).{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=106}} He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed.{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=107}} He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=42}} In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]], and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}}

Peter Collinson &amp;ndash; a wealthy [[Quaker]] cloth merchant, a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and one of the founders of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] &amp;ndash; donated (in 1746) a [[Leyden jar]] battery, a glass tube,{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} and an account of new German experiments in electricity to the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (founded by Franklin). The account described how to make electricity from the glass tube.{{sfn|Stearns|1970|p=620}} Franklin first experimented with static electricity in the middle of 1747, referring to it as "these new wonders."{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=54}} In conducting his initial electrical research, Franklin made use of the unique battery and glass tube provided by Collinson.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}}

[[Thomas Penn]], son of [[William Penn]], made an electrostatic machine that supplemented Collinson's equipment.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=53}} To these Franklin added an [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|electrostatic generating machine of his own design]] that was more efficient than the one given to him by Penn.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} It was convenient because it was constructed with a handle, like that of a common grindstone, and turned by the operator. The simple mechanical machine mechanism then spun an axle that had mounted on it a glass sphere that rubbed on a cloth pad.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=55}} The glass sphere bulb generated 'electric fire' (an [[electric charge]]) that was transferred through conductors to a Leyden jar capacitor that held the electric charge that was then used for experimentation.&lt;ref name=ExperimentingMethod&gt;{{cite news |last=Hillis |first= Newell|date=February 16, 1914 |title=The Quest of God |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9340462// | work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |location=Brooklyn, New York |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin formed a research core team that consisted of [[Ebenezer Kinnersley]], [[Thomas Hopkinson]], and [[Philip Syng]] and developed the first scientific research laboratory in America.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|pages=53–54}} He repeated his experiments to obtain the same results and recorded this observation. In this process he showed that anyone could repeat and prove these results themselves of the electrical principle if they did the experiment he detailed.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=55}} 

Franklin spent much time studying this new field of electricity, and from 1747 through 1750 sent many letters to Collinson on his findings. The book consists of a collection of these letters. The book came in pamphlet form for the first three editions. The last two editions were a book volume with hard covers. Franklin's letters explained his experiments and the observations he made from them. He sent these to Collinson to show that the equipment {{ndash}} put into the hands of the group of men associated with Library Company of Philadelphia {{ndash}} was being put to good use.{{sfn|Campbell|1999|page=54}}

[[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], a scientist specializing in the study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=49}} Watson received in 1746 from [[John Mitchell (geographer)|Dr. John Mitchell]] a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson and read it to the Society on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted to the Society more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] - the basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=41}}

Watson turned over some of these Franklin letters to the local publisher  [[Edward Cave]], who had them printed in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1750.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=81}} In April 1751 Cave printed in a publication more of the letters Collinson had received and they included corrections personally added by Franklin.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|p=92}} This publication was titled, ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity, Made in Philadelphia in America by Mr. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and Communicated in several letters to Mr. P. Collinson of London, F.R.S'' (London).{{sfn|Stearns|1970|pp=619–620}} It was a 90-page pamphlet of 86 numbered pages.&lt;ref name=letter1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |title=From Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, 28 March 1747 |author= |date= |website=Founders Online |publisher=National Historical Publications and Records Commission |access-date=July 12, 2015 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028190523/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |archivedate=28 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet included an unsigned preface written by Dr. [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]].{{sfn|Cohen|1956|pages=432, 478}} This first publication of ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity'' sold for the expensive price of two [[shillings]] and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] British money, {{Inflation|UK|.125|1751|2015|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=96}}

The eighteenth century book consists of a collection of letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.&lt;ref name=BF-PC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NolletDebunked&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-experiments-and-observations-on-electricity-made-at-philadelphia-in-america/oclc/942611109&amp;referer=brief_results |title=New experiments and observations on electricity : made at Philadelphia in America (Notes section) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005 |website=WorldCat - Book Details|publisher= [[Thompson Gale]]|access-date=February 16, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five English editions to this book. The first three editions were not hard cover volumes, but rather just pamphlets with paper covers of collected letters of Franklin. They were carelessly put together when published. Each of these pamphlet editions had supplements of additional letters that were added later and then republished. The first publication of 1751 was supplemented in 1753 with 20 more pages and called ''Supplemental Experiments and Observations, Part II''. It was numbered 89 to 109 and published by E. Cave.  This was again supplemented with an additional 44 pages in 1754, numbered 110 to 154, and titled ''New Experiments and Observations, Part III.'' It was published by R. Cave, the son of E. Cave. The second edition published in 1754 was a reprint of parts I and II of the first edition. The third edition published in 1760, 1762, and 1764 was a reprint of all three parts of the first edition and numbered 1–154.&lt;ref name=BF-PC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NolletDebunked/&gt;

In this first set of letters Franklin talked about ''electrical fire'', later (1749) changing the terminology to ''electrical fluid''.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=56}} He wrote to Collinson on June 5, 1747, that his experiments showed that the electrical fire was a new [[Classical element|element]] of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=450}}  Franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles, but only temporararily groups them together so that they can be collected and held in a Leyden jar of water and metal.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=450–454}} According to Franklin, one side of the Leyden jar had an accumulation of electrical fire, which he labeled as ''positive'' (''plus''), and the other side had a deficiency of electrical fire, labeled ''negative'' (''minus''). These losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially the modern law of [[charge conservation]] except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right, not just as a deficiency of positive charges.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=26-27}} It is an important principle in modern science that explains the [[microphysics]] of the electrification of gross bodies.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|pp=49–50}} In these letters, Franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as ''plus,'' ''minus,'' ''positive,'' ''negative,'' ''charge,'' ''discharge,'' ''armature,'' ''electric shock,'' ''electrician,'' ''condenser,'' ''conductor,'' and ''battery.''{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=40}}{{sfn|Wilson|1960|p=19}}
[[File:Leyden jar electric battery.jpg|thumb|upright 0.8|right| Leyden jar "electric battery"]]
Franklin's first experiments explained in this first set of letters to Collinson that the Leyden jar, a type of [[capacitor]], had equal and opposite charges on the inner and outer conductors.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} This was shown in illustrations in his book.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} The significant Franklin theory introduced to Collinson in a letter dated April 29, 1747, was the concept of the "dissectible condenser."{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=52}} Today we call this distribution of charges in a device, a capacitor.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=41}} He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side of it was a metal material (conducting matter).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} He observed that when the wire on the inside of the jar was ''electrised'' positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became ''electrised'' negatively in the same proportion.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}}

Franklin explained in these letters that in an experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself and not in the water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged he poured the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged. It turned out the electric force was not ''condensed'' in the water itself, as the new Leyden jar had no charge with this water from the first Leyden jar. Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle.{{sfn|Wilson|1960|p=21}} It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this "force" of equal and opposite charges.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=52}}{{sfn|Cohen|1956|p=452–465}}

Franklin further explains in these letters that the jar did not electrically balance itself, but a wire of some conducting material had to make contact from the inner conductor (plus) to the outer conductor (minus).{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} This way Franklin observed the balancing and combining of the two different states of electricity in the "miraculous bottle."{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=51}} In the later editions of the book Franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of Leyden jars that he termed "electrical battery" following the military term of the time of a "battery" being a group of cannons assembled together.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|pages=462}}{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=24–25}} Franklin assembled a number of parallel-plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were "armed" with a lead metal sheet on each side. He hooked them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge (balance) the battery when touched to both sides.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=53}}

The fourth edition, published in 1769, is the first complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that increased the number of pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his [[lightning rod]] invention, [[meteorological]] observations, [[human nature]], worldwide population increase, [[waterspout]]s, experiments on [[amber]], and information on his [[Franklin stove|Pennsylvania fireplace invention]]. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was published in 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.&lt;ref name=Note4+5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-21-02-0156 |title=Note on the Fourth and Fifth Editions of Experiments and Observations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2017 |website=Founders Online |publisher=US National Archives |access-date=March 15, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth English edition, published in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on different parts of the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German "electric tube" with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=149–170}}

== Editions ==
[[File:New Experiments PI&amp;II 1754.jpg|thumb|right|upright 1.60|Second edition 1754 of "New Experiments" of Part I and Part II]]
There were eleven editions of Experiments and Observations on Electricity. There were five English editions, three French editions, and an edition each in German, Italian and Latin. The first three English editions were similar, but not identical, and consisted of two or three parts. Each of these separate parts were printed and sold individually as a pamphlet. Each had a slight title change (i.e. "New", "Supplemental") apparently to promote selling additional copies to people that had bought before.{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=139–140}}

[[File:Franklin's Experiments 1752 French edition.jpg|thumb|left|upright 0.85|1752 French edition]]
The [[French language|French]] translation, published in 1752, contained an experiment suggesting that a long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=82}} In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity.{{sfn|Stearns|1970|p=624}} Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|p=82}}{{sfn|Benge|Benge|2005|page=126}} In London it was repeated in [[Spital Square]] on July 20, 1752, and again in [[Chelmsford, Essex]], on August 12, 1752.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9345310// | work= The Manning Times |location= Manning, South Carolina |date=December 25, 1907 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Experiment suggested by Franklin and performed by D'Alibald |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9346628// | work= Covina Argus |location= Covina, California |date= November 30, 1907 |via=[[newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the [[kite experiment]] that he talked about in a letter to Collinson dated October 19, 1752.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; A man by the name of G.

King Louis XV honored Franklin after seeing some of the electrical experiments done in the royal palace at [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germain]] near Paris, France. However physicist [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong.&lt;ref name=Nollet1753letter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-04-02-0154 |title= Jean-Antoine Nollet: Letters on Electricity|last=Nollet |first=Jean-Antoine |date=January 1, 1753 |website=NHPRC |publisher=US government National Archives |access-date=February 17, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often.

== Legacy ==

All editions of the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first publication of it was done in the United States by [[I. Bernard Cohen]].{{sfn|Purvis|2014|p=273}} The book is Franklin's only scientific work,{{sfn|Rosenberg|2009|page=212}} and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Kurutz|1980|page=212}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|page=181}} The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist.{{sfn|Cohen|1975|p=12}} Eighteenth-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] writes in his book ''[[The History and Present State of Electricity]]'' (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.{{efn-ua|"Priestley declares in his ''History and Present State of Electricity'': Nothing was ever written upon the subject of electricity which was more read and admired in all parts of Europe than these letters. There is hardly any European language into which they have not been translated; and, as if this were not sufficient to make them properly known, a translation of them has been lately made into Latin."{{sfn|Cohen|1941|pp=139–140}}  }}

Benjamin Franklin was given the [[Copley Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]] in 1753 in recognition of his work in electricity as reported in this book.&lt;ref name=ManWhoDared&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= A Man Who Dared Lightning |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9339326// | work=The Chatham Press  |location=Chatham, New Jersey |date=December 26, 1974 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fringe science''' is an inquiry in an established field of study which departs significantly from [[mainstream#In science|mainstream]] theories in that field and is considered to be questionable by the mainstream.

Fringe science may be either a questionable application of a scientific approach to a [[field of study]] or an approach whose status as scientific is widely questioned.

For mainstream scientists, attributes of fringe science include being highly speculative or relying on premises already [[Objection (argument)|refuted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dutch, Steven I |title=Notes on the nature of fringe science |journal=[[J Geol Ed]] |issn=0022-1368 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |date=January 1982 |id=ERIC EJ260409 |oclc=427103550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fringe science theories are often advanced by persons who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedlander, Michael W. |title=At the Fringes of Science |oclc=42309381}}p. 58{{Verify source|date=June 2010}}&lt;!--p 63?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |author=Isaac Asimov |title=Left Hand of the Electron|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-440-94717-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general public has difficulty distinguishing between science and its imitators,&lt;ref name=Fried173/&gt; and in some cases a "yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims".&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fringe science" covers everything from novel [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] which can be tested by means of the [[scientific method]] to wild [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc hypotheses]] and [[Mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]].  This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientists]], hobbyists, and [[Crank (person)|cranks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Bell |title=Secret science |journal=Science and Public Policy |date=December 1999 |volume=26 |issue=6 |page=450 |doi=10.1093/spp/26.6.450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms for questionable types of science are ''[[pathological science]]'', ''[[voodoo science]]'', and ''[[cargo cult science]]''. The term ''[[junk science]]'' is used to criticize research seen as dubious or fraudulent, as opposed to "solid science".

A concept that was once accepted by the mainstream [[scientific community]] may become fringe science because of a later evaluation of previous research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sld.cu/galerias/pdf/sitios/revsalud/beyerstein_cience_vs_pseudoscience.pdf|title=Distinhuishing Science from Pseudoscience|last=Beyerstein|first=Barry L.|date=July 1995|website=INFOMED - Red de Salud de Cuba|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[focal infection theory]], which held that focal infections of the tonsils or teeth are a primary cause of [[systemic disease]], was once considered to be medical fact. It has since been dismissed because of lack of evidence.

==Description==
The term "fringe science" denotes unorthodox scientific theories and [[Scientific modeling|models]]. Persons who create fringe science may have employed the [[scientific method]] in their work, but their results are not accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Fringe science may be advocated by a scientist who has some recognition within the larger scientific community, but this is not always the case. Usually the evidence provided by fringe science is accepted only by a minority and is rejected by most experts.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The boundary between fringe science and [[pseudoscience]] is disputed. The connotation of "fringe science" is that the enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results  for a variety of reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be considered [[pejorative]]. For example, Lyell D. Henry Jr. wrote that, "fringe science [is] a term also suggesting kookiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Lyell D. |year=1981 |title=Unorthodox science as a popular activity |journal=[[J Am Culture]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1981.0402_1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization is perhaps inspired by the [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric behavior]] of many researchers of the kind known colloquially (and with considerable historical precedent) as [[mad scientist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Runco |first1=Mark A |last2=Pritzker |first2=Steven R |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Creativity |volume=i–z |year=1999 |page=10 |contribution=}} {{Verify source|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most fringe science is rejected, the scientific community has come to accept some portions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such is [[plate tectonics]], an idea which had its origin in the fringe science of [[continental drift]] and was rejected for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| The confusion between science and pseudoscience, between honest scientific error and genuine scientific discovery, is not new, and it is a permanent feature of the scientific landscape .... Acceptance of new science can come slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
===Historical===
Some historical ideas that are considered to have been refuted by mainstream science are:

*[[Wilhelm Reich]]'s work with [[orgone]], a physical energy he claimed to have discovered, contributed to his alienation from the psychiatric community. He was eventually sentenced to two years in a federal prison, where he died.&lt;ref name="NYTOrgon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06E4DD1639E33BBC4A52DFB566838C649EDE | title=Two Scientists Jailed; Pair Sentenced in Maine in Sale of 'Accumulators' | publisher=The New York Times | date=12 March 1957 | accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time and continuing today, scientists disputed his claim that he had scientific evidence for the existence of orgone.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaofPseudoscienceOrgon"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XpEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1040 | title=Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy | publisher=Facts on File | author=Williams, William F. | year=2000 | pages=36, 55, 68, 248–249, 298–299 | isbn=081603351X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PseudoscienceWarsOrgon"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=orgone+pseudoscience#v=onepage&amp;q=orgone%20pseudoscience&amp;f=false | title=The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Gordin, Michael D. | year=2012 | pages=158–159 | isbn=022610172X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, amateurs and a few fringe researchers continued to believe that orgone is real.&lt;ref name="SRMHPOrgone"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.srmhp.org/0401/orgone-therapy.html | title=THE RESURRECTION OF WILHELM REICH AND ORGONE THERAPY | author=Klee, Gerald D. | journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice | year=2005 |volume=4 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiredOrgone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/fantastically-wrong-wilhelm-reich/ | title=Fantastically Wrong: Why Is the Sky Blue?

*[[Focal infection theory]] (FIT) as the primary cause of systemic disease rapidly became accepted by mainstream dentistry and medicine after World War I. This acceptance was largely based upon what later turned out to be fundamentally flawed studies. As a result, millions of people were subjected to needless [[dental extraction]]s and surgeries.&lt;ref name="FITPaper"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The focal infection theory: appraisal and reappraisal. | author=Pallasch, TJ | journal=Journal of the California Dental Association |date=March 2000  | volume=28 | issue=3 | pages=194–200 | pmid=11326533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original studies supporting FIT began falling out of favor in the 1930s. By the late 1950s, it was regarded as a [[fringe theory]].
*The [[Clovis culture|Clovis First]] theory held that the Clovis culture was the first culture in North America. It was long regarded as a mainstream theory until mounting evidence of a pre-Clovis culture discredited it.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, David S. (2009) ''Cave paintings and the human spirit'' p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waters|first=Michael|&lt;!--coauthors=Forman, Steven; Jennings, Thomas; Nordt, Lee; Driese, Steven, Feinberg, Joshua; Keene, Joshua; Halligan, Jessi; Lindquist, Anna; PIerson, James; Hallmark, Charles; Collins, Michael; Wiederhold, James--&gt;|title=The Buttermilk Creek Complex and the Origins of Clovis at the Debra L.

Relatively recent fringe sciences include:

In a 2005 article in ''[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence#Technology Review controversy|Technology Review]]'' (part of a larger series), it was stated that "SENS is highly speculative. Many of its proposals have not been reproduced, nor could they be reproduced with today's scientific knowledge and technology. Echoing [[Nathan Myhrvold|Myhrvold]], we might charitably say that de Grey's proposals exist in a kind of antechamber of science, where they wait (possibly in vain) for independent verification. SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jason |last=Pontin |title=Is defeating aging only a dream? |date=2006-07-11 |work=Technology Review | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/}} ''(includes June 9, 2006 critiques and rebuttals)''&lt;/ref&gt;
* A nuclear fusion reaction called [[cold fusion]] which occurs near room temperature and pressure was reported by chemists [[Martin Fleischmann]] and [[Stanley Pons]] in March 1989. Numerous research efforts at the time were unable to replicate their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A report from the American Physical Society spring meeting – 1–2 May 1989 Baltimore, MD Special session on cold fusion |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/physics/Cold-fusion/vince-cate/aps.ascii |accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of scientists have worked on cold fusion or have participated in international conferences on it. In 2004, the United States Department of Energy commissioned a panel on cold fusion to take another look at it. They wanted to determine whether their policies concerning it should be altered because of new evidence.

*The theory of [[abiogenic petroleum origin]] holds that [[petroleum]] was formed from deep carbon deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The ubiquity of hydrocarbons in the solar system is taken as evidence that there may be a great deal more petroleum on Earth than commonly thought, and that petroleum may originate from carbon-bearing fluids which migrate upward from the Earth's mantle. Abiogenic hypotheses saw a revival in the last half of the twentieth century by Russian and Ukrainian scientists. More interest was generated in the West after the 1999 publication by [[Thomas Gold]] of ''[[Thomas Gold#The Deep Hot Biosphere|The Deep Hot Biosphere]]''. Gold's version of the theory is partly based on the existence of a [[biosphere]] composed of [[thermophile]] bacteria in the Earth's crust, which might explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum.

===Accepted as mainstream===
Some theories that were once rejected as fringe science, but were eventually accepted as mainstream science, are:

==Responding to fringe science==
[[Michael W. Friedlander]] has suggested some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which, he argues, is a more difficult problem&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; than [[scientific misconduct]]. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener [[continental drift]] example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 178–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary so that mainstream science will not atrophy. Scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim, and certain fringe discoveries "will later graduate into the ranks of accepted" — while others "will never receive confirmation".&lt;ref name=Fried173&gt;Friedlander, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Wertheim]] profiled many "outsider scientists" in her book ''Physics on the Fringe'', who receive little or no attention from professional scientists.  She describes all of them as trying to make sense of the world using the scientific method, but in the face of not being able to understand the complex theories of modern science.  She also finds it fair that credentialed scientists do not bother spending a lot of time learning about and explaining problems with the fringe theories of uncredentialed scientists, since the authors of those theories have not taken the time to understand the mainstream theories they aim to disprove.&lt;ref&gt;http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/143369581/KERA_143369581.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Towards the end of the 20th century, some critics (such as [[Answers in Genesis]]) began to cite fringe science theories with limited support. Often their goal{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} was to classify as [[Controversy|controversial]] entire fields of scientific inquiry (notably [[paleoanthropology]], [[human sexuality]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]]) that contradict literal or fundamentalist interpretation of various [[Religious text|sacred texts]].

Critics argue that such controversies open a window of plausibility for [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The dangers of creationism in education |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm |publisher=Council of Europe |date=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813201055/http://www.assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc07%2FEDOC11297.htm |archivedate=2007-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Wedge |publisher=Discovery Institute |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard}}: Amicus curiae brief of 72 Nobel laureates, 17 state academies of science, and 7 other scientific organizations in support of appellees in {{ussc|482|578|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Donald E. Simanek]] asserts, "Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers." But the public is ignorant of the fact that "As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitional phase of confusion and uncertainty."&lt;ref name='Simanek'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting |title=Cutting edge science |accessdate=2008-04-01 |last=Simanek |first=Donald |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080319110815/http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media also play a role in propagating the belief that certain fields of science are controversial. In their 2003 paper "Optimising Public Understanding of Science and Technology in Europe: A Comparative Perspective", Jan Nolin ''et al.'' write that "From a media perspective it is evident that controversial science sells, not only because of its dramatic value, but also since it is often connected to high-stake societal issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/virusss/opus/OPUS%20Report%20Final.pdf |page=632 |author=Nolin, Jan |title=Optimising public understanding of science: A comparative perspective |format=PDF |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912101731/http://www.univie.ac.at/virusss/opus/OPUS%20Report%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VFPt horseshoe-magnet.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Horseshoe magnet with computed magnetic field lines. The two magnetic poles are in close vicinity, which concentrates the field lines and creates a strong magnetic field.]]

A '''horseshoe magnet''' is a [[magnet]] made in the shape of a [[horseshoe]]. The magnet has two magnetic poles close together. This shape creates a strong [[magnetic field]] between the poles. 

It is one type of permanent magnet, meaning that it stays magnetized, as opposed to an [[electromagnet]], the magnetic field of which can be started and stopped.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-horseshoe-magnet.htm|title=What is a Horseshoe Magnet? (with pictures)|newspaper=wiseGEEK|access-date=2016-11-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a horseshoe magnet's shape is to place the poles as close together as possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYIwT_dD77cC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=horseshoe+magnet+created+by+bending+a+bar+magnet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik6rHm6LvUAhVdHGMKHTwhCtMQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=horseshoe%20magnet%20created%20by%20bending%20a%20bar%20magnet&amp;f=false|title=Magnets: Magnetism|last=Lynette|first=Rachel|date=2008|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|isbn=9781432910976|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total [[magnetic flux]] is the same,{{efn-lr|This flux depends on the amount of magnetised material.|group=Notes}} but the [[magnetic field|field]] is greater, as it is spread over a smaller volume. A horseshoe is used, rather than a simpler C-shaped magnet, which is also used, because this places the maximum amount of magnetised material into the magnet, for given dimensions around the poles. A particularly large horseshoe magnet is U-shaped with long parallel sides, rather than the classical horseshoe.

Electromagnets are also constructed as horseshoes. They may have either one or two coils wound on them. As most coils are wound by machine, the coil formers are straight. They are thus usually placed as two coils, one on each side of a U-shaped horseshoe.

A horseshoe magnet can be created by bending a [[bar magnet]] into a horseshoe shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcAKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA669&amp;dq=A+horseshoe+magnet+is+a+magnet+made+in+the+shape+of+a+horseshoe.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwm5Oz6LvUAhUIwGMKHTeGChIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20horseshoe%20magnet%20is%20a%20magnet%20made%20in%20the%20shape%20of%20a%20horseshoe.&amp;f=false|title=College Physics: Reasoning and Relationships|last=Giordano|first=Nicholas|date=2012-07-27|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1285225341|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inside the Atom''''' is a [[popular science]] book by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. The first edition of the book was published in 1956 by [[Abelard-Schuman]]. Revised editions were brought out in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Science Newsletter"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Books of the Week|journal=The Science News-Letter|date=13 September 1958|volume=74|issue=11|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book describes the internal structure of the [[atom]]. The sequence of concepts described in the book follows the sequence that those facts were discovered in. It describes the various sub-atomic structures within the atom, and the functions they fill in the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruce|first1=Guy V.|title=Inside the Atom by Isaac Asimov|journal=The Clearing House|date=September 1957|volume=32|issue=1|pages=48–49|jstor=30180040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later chapters describe [[chemical element]]s and [[isotopes]], the stability and instability of [[atomic nuclei]], and finally [[atomic energy]], the uses it has, and the threat that it poses.&lt;ref name="Science Newsletter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inside the Atom|journal=Bulletin from Virginia Kirkus' Service|date=1 May 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review in the educational journal ''The Clearing House'' said that the book was "lucid", and that its "analytical style exemplifies the art of good teaching." The book is aimed at educated lay-readers, and high-school science students.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt; ''Inside the Atom'' ends on a cautionary note, stating "If only we can learn to use the knowledge we already have..."

In 1956, the book was used in a pilot program to advance science education sponsored by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Approximately two hundred titles were circulated amongst high schools that did not have adequate science reading material.&lt;ref name=Deason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deason|first1=Hilary J.|title=Traveling High-School Science Libraries|journal=Science |series=New Series|date=23 November 1956|volume=124|issue=3230|pages=1013–1017|jstor=1753196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Creation Research''' ('''ICR''') is a [[Creationist apologetics]] institute in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that specializes in media promotion of [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[creation science]] and interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]] as a historical event.&lt;ref name="Williams2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

==History==
[[Image:ICR building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Institute for Creation Research in [[Santee, CA]].]]
The origins of the ICR can be traced to the Creation Science Research Center set up by [[Henry M. Morris]], along with Nell and Kelly Segraves, at the Christian Heritage College (now [[San Diego Christian College]]) in 1970. However, the Segraveses and Morris disagreed on the focus of the center, with the Segraveses favoring political and promotional activities, whilst Morris favored educational and scientific efforts. This led to the breakup of the center in 1972, with the Segraveses taking control of the center and severing ties with the university, with Morris reorganising the remaining staff into the Institute for Creation Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006| pp = 313–315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICR defined its work in terms of three ministries: research, writing and speaking. Historian of science [[Ronald L. Numbers]] states that "[d]espite its name, the institute for years conducted little research outside the confines of its modest library" and cites (founding member) [[Duane Gish]] as "explain[ing] apologetically in 1978, [that]  the staff devoted much of its research effort to scouring the scientific literature for references favorable to creationism." Numbers does note that it engaged in a number of archaeological and geological expeditions, including two in [[Searches for Noah's Ark|search]] of the [[Mythology|mythical]] [[Noah's Ark]], with geologist Steven A. Austin, working as an "off and on" visiting scientist until taking a full staff position in 1979, single-handedly conducting most of its non-literary research.&lt;ref name=Num315&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential scientific creationist Walter E. Lammerts complained that "[t]he main trouble is that Henry looks at this whole thing as a sort of 'missionary' effort rather than a scientific one."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=315–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintained tax-exempt status as a religious institution carrying out "non-scientific research."&lt;ref name=Flank&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Flank | first1 = Lenny | title = Deception by Design: The Intelligent Design Movement in America | date = | publisher = Red and Black Publishers | location = | isbn = 0-9791813-0-5 | page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s the ICR severed its ties with Christian Heritage College to downplay its religious connections and portray itself as secular scientific institution.&lt;ref name=Flank/&gt; [[Ken Ham]], a speaker and former high school science teacher in Australia,&lt;ref name=racm9&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trollinger |first1=Susan L. |last2=Trollinger, Jr. |first2=William Vance |title=Righting America at the Creation Museum |publisher=JHU Press |year=2016 |isbn=9781421419534 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOf-CwAAQBAJ |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; once worked for the ICR producing a series of seminars "Back to Genesis".&lt;ref name="Numbers 401"&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Ham left ICR to found what would become [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG).&lt;ref name="Numbers 401"/&gt; Currently, at least one ICR staff member is also on staff at AiG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/a_snelling.asp Andrew Snelling biography], [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the ICR helped [[Education in Turkey|Turkey’s education minister]] Vehbi Dinçerler, introduce Islamic creationism in [[Turkey|Turkish]] high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/11102743.asp?gid=244 | title=Turkey evolves as creationist center | publisher=[[Hürriyet|Hurriyet Daily News]] |date= February 27, 2009 | first=Sevim | last=Songün | accessdate =2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the ICR's statement of belief was cited in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling of [[Edwards v. Aguillard]]. Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] wrote that "If no valid secular purpose can be identified, then the statute violates the [[Establishment Clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html#POWELLI | title=Edwards v.

In 2007, the institute relocated from [[Santee, California|Santee]], California, to Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref name = ncseicr&gt;{{cite news |title= ICR seeks to grant degrees in Texas |url= http://ncse.com/news/2007/12/icr-seeks-to-grant-degrees-texas-001147 |publisher= National Center for Science Education |date= 2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, who died the previous year, said the move was intended to give the ICR a central national location, Dallas' proximity to a major airport, and a larger population for their ministry.&lt;ref name=TCS&gt;{{Cite journal

==Research and publications==
{{Creationism2}}
In a 1995 review of work published by ICR researchers, [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] writes, "Neither in the creationist literature nor in the scientific literature have I found any reference to professional research by these individuals in genetics, paleontology, taxonomy, anatomy, or any of the other fields most relevant to the study of evolution."  He found their work most often published instead by an overtly religious publishing house, [[Creation-Life Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |publisher=Sinauer |year=1995 |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0-87893-184-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also publishes a monthly magazine [[Acts and Facts]] devoted to articles "dealing with creation, evolution, and related topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acts and Facts Magazine |publisher=Institute for Creation Research |accessdate= October 19, 2017 |url=http://www.icr.org/icr-magazines/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the ICR is primarily distributed through religious settings as well as before public audiences in live debates with scientists and other supporters of biological evolution.

ICR launched the [[Vision Forum#Jonathan Park|Jonathan Park]] radio drama series based on a book of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Acts and Facts Magazine |title=ICR Radio Adventure Jonathan Park and the Mystery of the Hidden Cave |date=May 2000 |issue=5 |volume=29 |url=http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/af/af0005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the radio program was transferred to [[Vision Forum Ministries]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionforum.com/news/blogs/doug/2005/05/1107/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205174912/http://www.visionforum.com/news/blogs/doug/2005/05/1107/ |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |title=What is Jonathan Park? |author=Doug Phillips |date=May 16, 2005 |work=Doug's Blog |publisher=Vision Forum |accessdate=6 April 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master Books==
Master Books is a division within Creation-Life Publishers, another enterprise Morris helped to found.  It serves as the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and specializes in theology and creation science works.  Master Books' anti-evolution books are in wide distribution, promoted by most of the large creationist organizations as well as the ICR.&lt;ref name=evsc&gt;{{cite book |last= Scott |first= Eugenie |authorlink= Eugenie Scott |title= Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction |year= 2004 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location=Westport Connecticut-London |isbn= 0-313-32122-1 |oclc= 54752786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School and accreditation==

In June 1981, the ICR received formal state approval in California to offer degree programs, and its first graduate level courses were taught in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name="ICRHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icr.org/discover/index/discover_history/ | title = Institute for Creation Research-History | work = Institute for Creation Research | accessdate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=317–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the ICR sought re-approval. A five-person committee from the [[California Department of Education]] sent to evaluate ICR's degree program found its graduate school consisted of only five full-time faculty and some courses were videotaped rather than professor-led instruction. The committee failed to grant re-approval by 3–2 vote, a move the ICR attributed to "religious intolerance" rather than criticisms of the quality of education it provided.&lt;ref name="Numbers 2006 318"/&gt; This resulted in [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] barring the institute from granting master's degrees in science, which encompassed their existing graduate degree programs in the teaching of biology, geology, astrogeophysics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= California Bars Degrees at Creationist School | author=[[Sandra Blakeslee]] | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DB1638F93BA35751C1A96E948260 | publisher=New York Times | date=1988-12-08 | accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICR filed a lawsuit against California's State Superintendent, [[Bill Honig]], and was awarded a settlement of $225,000 and given permission to continue its program until 1995 so long as it continued to teach evolution alongside creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Delos B. McKown |title=The Mythmaker's Magic |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original agreement expired in 1995, and [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education]] (BPPVE) granted the ICR religious exemption from [[secondary school|postsecondary school]] requirements in California.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to California Colleges and Universities-Institute For Creation Research, Retrieved on 2007-11-26 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070818184624/http://www.cpec.ca.gov/collegeguide/Institution.asp?id=E0380A&amp;bhcp=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the ICR received accreditation from the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS). According to Morris, TRACS and ICR founder, TRACS is a "product of the ICR Graduate School" and was created "Because of the prejudice against creation-science, outspoken creationist schools such as ICRGS used to stand little or no chance of getting recognition through accreditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The ICR Graduates | author=Sandra Blakeslee | url=http://www.icr.org/article/495/ | publisher=Institute for Creation Research | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TRACS was officially recognized as an accreditor by the US Department of Education in 1991. Following the ICR's move to Dallas, in November 2007, TRACS terminated its accredited status after the ICR requested its termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf |title=Accreditation Commission Meeting |accessdate=2008-01-09 |format=PDF |work=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210411/http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas does not recognize TRACS' accreditation.&lt;ref name=TCS/&gt;

The ICR's relocation to Texas required Texas state approval or accreditation by a [[regional accreditation|regional accrediting agency]], in this case [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).&lt;ref name = jaschik/&gt; In 2007, the ICR applied for a temporary state certification there which would have allowed the institute to operate while it pursues accreditation through SACS.&lt;ref name=mysa&gt;{{cite news|first=Melissa |last=Ludwig |title=Institute proposes online degrees in creationism |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA121907.01A.Creationism.2951a43.html |publisher=Express News |location=San Antonio |date=2007-12-19 |accessdate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207185419/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA121907.01A.Creationism.2951a43.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the [[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]] (THECB) received an advisory committee recommendation to allow the ICR to start offering online master's degrees in [[science education]].

The Board originally planned to decide on the issue at their January 2008 meeting.&lt;ref name = jaschik&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insidehighered.com/layout/set/print/news/2007/12/17/texas |title= Creationist College advances in Texas |accessdate=2008-01-04 |last= Jaschik |first= Scott |date= 2007-12-17 |publisher=Inside Higher Ed }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it applied, ICR graduate school had approximately 30 to 50 students, most teachers from private Christian schools or home-schoolers, and four full-time faculty.&lt;ref name= dallas/&gt;&lt;ref name="austin "/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite news |title= Texas-Based Creationism Institute Seeks to Offer Science Education Degree |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,317533,00.html |publisher= Fox News |date= 2007-12-19 |accessdate=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeking the advice from an independent panel, the Chairman of the Texas Board requested information about the research conducted by the faculty, how an on-line program would expose students to the experimental side of science, and asked why "[t]heir curriculum doesn't line up very well with the curriculum available in conventional master of science programs."&lt;ref name="ncse.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/01/decision-icrs-graduate-school-deferred-001690 | title=Decision on ICR's graduate school deferred | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date= January 17, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the ICR asked the THECB to delay its decision until their next meeting, on April 24, 2008 to give them time to respond.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"/&gt; [[Inside Higher Ed]] reported "lobbying — by scientists against the institute, and by others in its favor — is going strong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/01/25/qt ''[[Inside Higher Ed]],''] January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The [[Dallas Morning News]]'' obtained some of the messages sent to the board and published a number of examples and summaries that illustrated how intense the debate had become.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/012408dnmetcreation.2bd704c.html "Creationist institute's master's science degree proposal creates debate,"] ''Dallas Morning News,'' January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the response from the ICR to the Board, Steven Schafersman, of the [[Texas Citizens for Science]], reported that the ICR sent out "prayer requests" and is currently arguing a creationist derived distinction of science in their application for approval.&lt;ref name="texscience.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texscience.org/reviews/icr-duality-science.htm |title=The Disjunctive Duality of Science Distinction |publisher=[[Texas Citizens for Science]] |date=January 15, 2008 |first=Steven |last=Schafersman |accessdate=2008-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119224010/http://www.texscience.org/reviews/icr-duality-science.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2008, education board's Academic Excellence and Research Committee [[unanimous]]ly voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees citing "the institute’s program is infused with creationism and runs counter to conventions of science that hold that claims of supernatural intervention are not testable and therefore lie outside the realm of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Panel rejects creation institute's proposal |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2008/04/23/panel_rejects_creation_institu.html |publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=April 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050448/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2008/04/23/panel_rejects_creation_institu.html |archivedate=June 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day the full Board unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees. The decision was "based the recommendation on two considerations:
# ICR failed to demonstrate that the proposed degree program meets acceptable standards of science and science education.
#The proposed degree is inconsistent with Coordinating Board rules which require the accurate labeling or designation of programs … Since the proposed degree program inadequately covers key areas of science, it cannot be properly designated either as 'science' or 'science education.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ICR fails to obtain certification in Texas |url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/icr-fails-to-obtain-certification-texas-001688 |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |date= April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICR said it would appeal the decision saying the Education Board was guilty of "viewpoint discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Creationist school fights ruling

In 2010, the ICR board of directors voted to close the ICR Graduate School and open a School of Biblical Apologetics, offering a Master of Christian Education degree with Creation Research being one of four minors.&lt;ref name="Defeat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nwcreation.net/articles/Is_there_a_future.pdf | title=Fighting the Dragon | publisher=[[Creation Ministries International|Journal of Creation]] |year= 2010 | first=Chris  | last=Ashcraft | accessdate =2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICR noted that "Due to the nature of ICR's School of Biblical Apologetics — a predominantly religious education school — it is exempt from licensing by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.&lt;ref name="Defeat" /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Scientific criticism===
Young-earth creationism is rejected by nearly all scientists, including most scientists who hold to Christian faith &lt;ref name="Newsweek 1987 Martz McDaniel"&gt;As reported by [[Newsweek]]:  "By one count there are some 700 [[scientist]]s (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to [[creation science|creation-science]], the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'," in "Keeping [[God]] out of the Classroom ([[Washington DC|Washington]] and bureau reports)",
Larry Martz &amp; Ann McDaniel, [[Newsweek]] CIX(26): 23–24, June 29, 1987, ISSN 0028-9604&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coe_report&gt;"Creationism claims to be based on scientific rigour. In reality the methods employed by creationists are of three types: purely dogmatic assertions; distorted use of scientific quotations, sometimes illustrated with magnificent photographs; and backing from more or less well-known scientists, most of whom are not specialists in these matters".{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?link=/documents/adoptedtext/ta07/eres1580.htm |title=The dangers of creationism in education |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |accessdate=2011-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307163155/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta07%2FERES1580.htm |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 45 science organizations having criticized creationism as [[Pseudoscience|not science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/science | title=Statements from Scientific and Scholarly Organizations |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | year=2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Massimo Pigliucci]], a professor of [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], has criticized ICR for professing to present the same science as that taught in secular universities while at the same time requiring students and faculty to sign a statement of faith to ICR's fundamentalist religious mission, most notably in affirming conformity in all its work to Biblical doctrine. Pigliucci notes that any research conducted within the ICR's policy framework is prescribed at the outset by [[Biblical literalism]], and thus antithetical to the methods and [[scientific method|framework used by scientists]].&lt;ref name=Pigliucci&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigliucci | first = Massimo | authorlink = Massimo Pigliucci |title= Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |year= 2002 |isbn=0-87893-659-9 |oclc= |doi= |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Pigliucci cites ICR scientist Harold Slusher resorting to [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] and non-Einsteinian explanations of [[speed of light|light travel]] to reconcile the vast distances light travels in space with the brief timescale given in young earth creationism, and the association adopted by the ICR between the second principle of thermodynamics and the Bible's account of the [[fall of Adam]]. Pigliucci further claimed that "some of the historical claims found in the ICR museum are also stunning and show how easily ideology gets the better of accuracy."&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt;

On January 7, 2007 the [[National Center for Science Education]] reported that ''[[Grand Canyon: A Different View]]'', edited by Tom Vail and published by [[Master Books]], the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and described as promoting "a young-earth creationist view of the geology of the [[Grand Canyon]]," was facing new scrutiny by [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]] (PEER) in December 2006. The Chief of the Park Service's Geologic Resources Division recommended its removal on grounds that it "does not use accurate, professional and scholarly knowledge; is not based on science but a specific religious doctrine; does not further the public's understanding of the Grand Canyon's existence; [and] does not further the mission of the National Park Service".&lt;ref name=ncse&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/27/3-4/renewed-concern-creationism-at-grand-canyon-national-park | title=Renewed concern about creationism at Grand Canyon National Park | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date= January 7, 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate =2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the National Center for Science Education, written by Chemist [[Karen Bartelt]] was critical of the ICR representatives and displays in the "museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/visit-to-institute-creation-research | title=A Visit to the Institute for Creation Research |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | year=1998 | first=Eugenie | last=Scott | accessdate = 2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism from old Earth creationists===
[[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth creationists]] are opposed to the ICR. [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] "opposes the ICR on the grounds that they" think the second principle of [[thermodynamics]] contradicts evolution, and John W. Robbins considers the ICR's activities a "fraud."&lt;ref name=Pigliucci/&gt; The old-Earth creationist organization [[Answers In Creation]] criticizes the ICR,&lt;ref name="AnCreation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answersincreation.org/rebuttal/icr/institute_for_creation_research.htm | author=[[Answers In Creation]] | title= Creation Science Rebuttals: Institute for Creation Research | work= | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a critical review by [[Kevin R. Henke]], Ph.D of the ICR's dating claims.&lt;ref name="Henke"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answersincreation.org/rebuttal/icr/institute_for_creation_research.htm | author=Kevin R.

St. Helens Dacite: The Failure of Austin and Swenson to Recognize Obviously Ancient Minerals | work=[[Answers In Creation]] | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henke concluded that the ICR's "research" was improperly conducted and "was unsuccessful in adequately separating the volcanic glass from the much older minerals."&lt;ref name="Henke"/&gt;  Another creationist opponent of ICR and its doctrine is [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], who accepts the scientific consensus of a [[Age of the Earth|4.54 billion year old Earth]] and is critical of ICR's cosmological models as well as their attempts to solve the starlight problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/humphreys_debate_statement.shtml |title=Exchanges Between Dr. Hugh Ross and Dr. Russell Humphreys |accessdate=2008-11-06 |author=Hugh Ross and Russell Humphreys |date=August 2002 |publisher=Reasons to Believe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827181645/http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/humphreys_debate_statement.shtml |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icr.org/article/345/ |title=Hugh Ross, ICR, and Facts of Science |accessdate=2008-11-06 |author= James Stambaugh |publisher=ICR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism over awarding degrees===
The ICR attracted much opposition when it sought approval in Texas to operate a master's degree program in science education.&lt;ref name="texscience.org"/&gt; An April 2008 survey by [[Texas Freedom Network]] showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR's request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survey shows overwhelming opposition to ICR certification
 |url= http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/survey-shows-overwhelming-opposition-to-icr-certification-001687 |publisher= [[National Center for Science Education]] |date= April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials of the institute state their goal is to integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements ICR officials say that [[scientific literacy]] will be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR say the institute's true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools.

:''This page is about information objects. For the university library, see [[University of Indonesia#Campuses]]. The term ''knowledge crystal'' has also been used independently in several places in the popular culture, but no Wikipedia pages exist about that.

'''Knowledge crystals''' are [[world wide web|web]]-based information objects that are used in [[scientific information]] production. Especially, they are used in [[open assessment]]s designed to support societal decisions. They act as current best answers to specific research questions. They are produced and distributed openly using [[crowdsourcing]] and scientific criticism.

== Definition and principles ==

'''Knowledge crystals''' are web-based information objects (in practice, web pages with a specific topic) that are used in scientific information production. They were first described in a report by [[National Public Health Institute of Finland]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="ora"&gt;Open risk assessment: a new way of providing scientific information for decision-making. National Public Health Institute, B18/2007. [http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-740-736-6]&lt;/ref&gt; at that time using name ''variable'' and later ''ovariable'' (from ''open variable''). The term ''knowledge crystal'' was first used in a review article about big data not earlier than in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomisto JT. Massadata kansanterveyden edistämisessä. [Big data in promotion of public health.] (in Finnish) Duodecim 2015;131:2179–87. URN:NBN:fi-fe201601071478&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a knowledge crystal is to provide best current scientifically defendable answer or answers to a specific research question and also give enough rationale to convince a critical rational observer that the answers are plausible. This gives knowledge crystals their particular structure: question, answer, and rationale. To promote the use of answers in decision support and elsewhere, they are by default published as [[open data]]. Especially, they are used in [[open assessment]]s designed to support societal decisions. They are produced and distributed openly using crowdsourcing and scientific criticism. In disputes, arguments that are based on direct observations and data are the strongest.&lt;ref name="kc"&gt;Tuomisto JT. Knowledge crystal. Opasnet, 2016. [http://en.opasnet.org/w/Knowledge_crystal], accessed April 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The open participation in knowledge crystal production is inspired by the criteria for evaluating implementation of the Aarhus Convention principles by Hartley and Wood,&lt;ref&gt;Hartley N, Wood C: Public participation in environmental impact assessment – implementing the Aarhus Convention. Environmental Impact Assessment Review 2005, 25:319–340.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and particularly the seven categories of principles of public participation by Webler and Tuler.&lt;ref&gt;Webler T, Tuler S: Fairness and Competence in Citizen Participation – Theoretical Reflections From a Case Study. Administration &amp; Society 2000, 32:566–595.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pohjola MV, Leino O, Kollanus V, Tuomisto JT, Gunnlaugsdóttir H, Holm F, Kalogeras N, Luteijn JM, Magnússon SH, Odekerken G, Tijhuis MJ, Ueland O, White BC, Verhagen H. State of the art in benefit-risk analysis: Environmental health. Food Chem Toxicol. (2012) 50: 1: 40–55. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21708210]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than consensus, knowledge crystals aim to produce [[shared understanding]], where all relevant views and facts are described in such a detail that participants can see where there are agreements and where disagreements and why. It is also essential that scientifically falsified views do not affect the answer but that they are shown in the rationale to avoid repetition of previous mistakes. This is an essential part of a decision support approach called [[open policy practice]], where information is structured specifically by using knowledge crystals&lt;ref&gt;Tuomisto, Jouni T.; Pohjola, Mikko; Pohjola, Pasi.

== Usage ==

Knowledge crystals are extensively used in [[Opasnet]], a web-workspace for making open assessments to support societal decisions. The method was initially developed to promote environmental health assessments, but it was deliberately expanded to cover [[health impact assessment]]s and other areas of decision support.

There are different kinds of knowledge crystals. ''Assessments'' are produced to answer practical information needs related to actual decisions to be made. They consist of ''variables'', which contain answers to related scientific questions such as health impacts of planned decision actions. There are also ''methods'', which give specific guidance on how to produce a particular kind of variable, e.g. a [[disease burden]] estimate. Typically, knowledge crystals are continually updated when new information arises. However, assessments are usually closed when the decision has been made, but the variables that the assessments used are kept open and used in subsequent assessments.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt;

The standardised structure of knowledge crystals enables the building of assessment models or different Internet applications on top of them. This is based on the idea that even though the content is updated, a knowledge crystal remains in the same, computer-readable format with a permanent [[URL]]. A specific feature is also that an understandable summary, technical details and metadata for an expert, possible discussions, and open data are all found from the same page.

== Criticism ==

The main criticism by researchers has been that collaborating online will take time away from the real work, namely publishing scientific articles about original research. Also, doubts have been presented whether it would be possible to manage a scientifically high-quality process if anyone could participate, even those who have vested interest in the topic.

In [[medicine]], a '''laboratory specimen''' is a [[biological specimen]] taken by [[sample (medicine)|sampling]], that is, gathered matter of a medical patient's tissue, fluid, or other material derived from the patient used for laboratory analysis to assist [[differential diagnosis]] or staging of a [[disease]] process. Common examples include [[throat]] swabs, [[sputum]], [[urine]], [[blood]], [[surgical drain]] fluids, and [[tissue biopsies]].

The '''Leo Szilard Lectureship Award''' (originally called the '''Leo Szilard Award''')&lt;ref name="APSNews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Szilard Lectureship Award is Funded |url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199811/szlilard.cfm|website=APS News|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given annually by the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) for "outstanding accomplishments by physicists in promoting the use of physics for the benefit of society".&lt;ref name=Awardees/&gt; It is given internationally in commemoration of physicist [[Leo Szilard]].&lt;ref name="APSNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakharov"/&gt;

{{quote|"In the year's of Szilard's life and activity it became clearer than ever before how great the responsibility of scientists is to the society.  And, to a large extent, it is due to Szilard that this awareness began to spread in the scientific community." - Andrei Sakharov&lt;ref name="Sakharov"/&gt;}}

It is often awarded to physicists early in their careers who are active in areas such as [[environmental issues]], [[arms control]], or [[science policy]]. {{As of|2015}} the recipient is given $3,000 plus $2,000 travel expenses and is expected to lecture at an APS meeting and at educational or research laboratories, to promote awareness of their activities.&lt;ref name=Awardees/&gt;

'''''[[De rerum natura]]''''' (usually translated as ''On the Nature of Things'') is a philosophical epic poem written by [[Lucretius]] in Latin around 55 BCE. The poem was lost during the Middle Ages, rediscovered in 1417, and first printed in 1473. Its earliest published translation into any language (French) did not occur until 1650; in English — although earlier partial or unpublished translations exist — the first complete translation to be published was that of [[Thomas Creech]], in [[heroic couplet]]s, in 1682. Only a few more English translations appeared over the next two centuries, but in the 20th century translations began appearing more frequently.

Only complete (or nearly complete) translations are listed. Notable translations of individual passages include the "invocation to Venus" by [[Edmund Spenser]] in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' IV.X.44-47; and five passages in [[John Dryden]]'s ''Sylvae'' (1685).

==Key==

* '''Year''' — The year of first publication (except where * indicates year of composition).
* '''Translator'''
* '''Publication''' — The name of the work as published; ISBNs and links to PDFs when available; other publication information.
* '''Source''' — Some translators refer to multiple Latin editions; only the ''primary'' Latin source text (if known) is noted here.
* '''Notes''' — "Prose" or the form of verse is always listed first, so that sorting on this column groups formally similar translations; other germane information follows.

'Boaters') in 1951. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years, until Procter &amp; Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create [[Pampers]].

Another diaper design was created by [[Valerie Hunter Gordon]] (née de Ferranti), who patented it in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paddi|publisher=paddi.org.uk|url=http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|accessdate=August 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404192409/http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|archivedate=April 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC – Radio4|title=Home truth – Nappy days|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/20050228_nappy_inventor.shtml|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

;[[Stars]] are  primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
:[[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] found in her 1925 PhD thesis that stars are primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].  Thus, her thesis established that hydrogen is the most abundant [[Chemical element|element]] in the Universe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

:When Payne's dissertation was reviewed, astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]] dissuaded her from concluding that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen and thus very different from that of the Earth, as it contradicted the accepted wisdom at the time. She consequently described the result in her thesis as "spurious".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=We Need to Talk About Kelvin|last=Chown|first=Marcus|publisher=faber and faber|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=99–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell realized she was correct four years later after having derived the same result by different means and publishing it in 1929.

==Physics==
;[[Radiation]]
:[[Marie Curie]] (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska) was the first woman to receive a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prize for her works on [[radiations]] and, up until today,{{when|date=May 2018|maybe use an {{as of}} template?}} the only woman to receive two Nobel prizes (among them, one Nobel prize in [[chemistry]] for discoveries on [[Polonium]] and [[Radium]]). She is the sole [[laureate]] to be recognized within two distinct [[scientific]] areas.

: [[Fanny Gates]] further investigated the properties of radiation.  Together with [[Ernest Rutherford]], she amassed evidence that radioactivity was not the result of any simple chemical or physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in chemistry : their changing roles from alchemical times to the mid-twentieth century|last=F.|first=Rayner-Canham, Marelene|date=1998|publisher=American Chemical Society|others=Rayner-Canham, Geoffrey.|isbn=978-0841235229|location=Washington, DC|oclc=38886653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Gates showed that radioactivity could not be destroyed by heat or ionization due to chemical reactions, and that radioactive materials differ from phosphorescent [[materials]] both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;

She carried out physics experiments, popularizing the work of [[Leibniz]]. She demonstrated that the [[kinetic energy]] of an object was proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity, and postulated a [[conservation law]] for the total energy of a system.

;Heavy elements in [[cosmic radiation]]
:As a graduate student, [[Phyllis S. Freier]] found evidence for the existence of elements heavier than [[helium]] in [[cosmic radiation]].Her work was published in ''Physical Review'' in 1948 with co-authors [[Edward J.

;[[Nuclear shell]]
:[[Maria Goeppert Mayer]], a German immigrant to the US who studied at [[Johns Hopkins]] during the [[Great Depression]], persisted in her studies even when no university would employ her and became a [[chemical physicist]]. Her most-famous contribution to [[modern physics]] was discovering the [[nuclear shell]] of the [[atomic nucleus]], for which she won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1963.

;[[Francium]]
: In 1939 [[Marguerite Perey]], a student of [[Marie Curie]], discovered the element [[francium]] by purifying samples of [[lanthanum]] that contained [[actinium]].  Perey first noticed that the actinium she purified was emitting unexpected radiation. After further study she was able to isolate this new element which she named "[[francium]]" for France..&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite magazine|title=My Great-Great-Aunt Discovered Francium.

;[[Nuclear fission]]
:  Austrian-Swedish [[physics|physicist]] Lise Meitner, together with [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]], led the small group of scientists who first discovered [[nuclear fission]] of uranium when it absorbed an extra [[neutron]].  The results were published in early 1939.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Meitner, Hahn and Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy.

;[[Hearing the shape of a drum| You can't hear the shape of a drum. ]]

In 1966 [[Mark Kac]] asked whether the shape of a drum could be determined by the sound it makes (whether a [[Riemannian manifold]]

[[John Milnor]] observed that a theorem due to Witt implied the existence of a pair of 16-dimensional tori that have the same spectrum but different shapes. However, the problem in two dimensions remained open until 1992, when [[Carolyn S. Gordon]] with coauthors [[David Webb (mathematician)|Webb]] and Wolpert, constructed a pair of regions in the Euclidean plane that have different shapes but identical eigenvalues  (see figure on right). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-199706|title=American Mathematical Society|website=www.ams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hilbert's tenth problem]]

'''Hilbert's tenth problem''' is the tenth on the [[Hilbert's problems|list of mathematical problems]] that the German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed in 1900.  It is the challenge to provide a general [[algorithm]] which, for any given [[Diophantine equation]] (a [[polynomial]] equation with [[integer]] coefficients and a finite number of unknowns) can decide whether the equation has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values. 

For example, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;3x^2-2xy-y^2z-7=0&lt;/math&gt; has an integer solution: &lt;math&gt;x=1,\ y=2,\ z=-2&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt; has no such solution.

Hilbert's tenth problem has been solved, and it has a negative answer: such a general algorithm does not exist. This is the result of combined work of [[Martin Davis]], [[Yuri Matiyasevich]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Julia Robinson]] which spans 21 years, with Yuri Matiyasevich completing the theorem in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Barry Cooper]], ''Computability theory'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is now known as [[Matiyasevich's theorem]] or the MRDP theorem.

;[[Three-gap theorem]]
The three-gap theorem states that if one places ''n'' points on a circle, at angles of ''&amp;theta;'', 2''&amp;theta;'', 3''&amp;theta;'' ... from the starting point, then there will be at most three distinct distances between pairs of points in adjacent positions around the circle.

;[[Noether normalization lemma]]

The Noether normalization lemma is a result of [[commutative algebra]], introduced by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that for any [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', and any [[Finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] commutative [[algebra over a field|''k''-algebra]] ''A'', there exists a nonnegative integer ''d'' and [[algebraically independent]] elements ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' 
such that ''A'' is a finitely generated module over  the polynomial ring ''S'':=''k''[''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;].

The theorem has a geometric interpretation. Suppose ''A'' is integral. Let ''S'' be the [[coordinate ring]] of the ''d''-dimensional [[affine space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;, and ''A'' as the coordinate ring of some other ''d''-dimensional [[affine variety]] ''X''.  Then the [[inclusion map]] ''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A'' induces a surjective [[finite morphism]] of [[affine varieties]] &lt;math&gt;X\to \mathbb A^d_k&lt;/math&gt;. The conclusion is that any [[affine variety]] is a [[branched covering]] of affine space.

The [[Noether normalization lemma]] is an important step to proving Hilbert's [[Nullstellensatz]].

;[[Noether's theorem]]

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

;[[isomorphism theorems]]

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[abstract algebra]], the '''isomorphism theorems''' are three [[theorem]]s that describe the relationship between [[quotient]]s, [[homomorphism]]s, and [[subobject]]s.  Versions of the theorems exist for [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[vector space]]s, [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[Lie algebra]]s, and various other [[algebraic structure]]s.  In [[universal algebra]], the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.

The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by [[Emmy Noether]] in her paper ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'' which was published in 1927 in [[Mathematische Annalen]].  Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of [[Richard Dedekind]] and previous papers by Noether.

Three years later, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. van der Waerden]] published his influential ''Algebra,'' the first [[abstract algebra]] textbook that took the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]-[[Ring (mathematics)|rings]]-[[Field (mathematics)|fields]] approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on [[group theory]] and [[Emil Artin]] on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], [[Otto Schreier]], and van der Waerden himself on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called ''homomorphism theorem'', and ''two laws of isomorphism'' when applied to groups, appear explicitly.

;[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lasker–Noether theorem''' states that every [[Noetherian ring]] is a '''Lasker ring''', which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called '''primary decomposition''', of finitely many ''[[primary ideal]]s'' (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of [[prime ideal]]s).  The theorem was first proven by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emanuel Lasker|first=Emanuel|last= Lasker|year= 1905}} for the special case of [[polynomial ring]]s and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emmy Noether|first=Emmy |last=Noether|year= 1921}}.

The Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and more generally the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in [[algebraic geometry]], by asserting that every [[algebraic set]] may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of [[irreducible component]]s.

;[[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]]

In [[algebraic number theory]], the '''Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem''' states that a [[central simple algebra]] over an [[algebraic number field]] ''K'' which splits over every [[local field|completion]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[matrix ring|matrix algebra]] over ''K''. The theorem is an example of a [[local-global principle]] in [[algebraic number theory]] and 
leads to a complete description of finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over algebraic number fields in terms of their [[Hasse invariant of an algebra|local invariants]]. It was proved independently by [[Richard Brauer]], [[Helmut Hasse]], and [[Emmy Noether]] and by [[Abraham Adrian Albert]].

Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in [[science]], of "[[multiple independent discovery]]". [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert K.|title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science|journal=European Journal of Sociology|date=December 1963|volume=4|issue=02|pages=237–282|doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801|jstor=23998345}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|author=Robert K.

Merton|title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPvcHuUMEMwC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22Sometimes+the+discoveries+are+simultaneous+or+almost+so%22&amp;dq=merton+%22The+Sociology+of+Science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sometimes%20the%20discoveries%20are%20simultaneous%20or%20almost%20so%22&amp;f=false|year=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-52092-6|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others, described by A. Rupert Hall;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War'', New York, Cambridge University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th-century discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others; and the [[theory of evolution|theory of the evolution]] of [[species]], independently advanced in the 19th century by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

Multiple independent discovery, however, is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research. Merton believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science", ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton"—a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], ''On Social Structure and Science'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is drawn between a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and an [[invention]], as discussed for example by [[Logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|Bolesław Prus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''O odkryciach i wynalazkach'' ([[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]):  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus], Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since the same phenomenon of [[multiple discovery|multiplicity]] occurs in relation to both discoveries and inventions, this article lists both multiple discoveries and multiple ''inventions''.

The concept was independently introduced by [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and [[Gregory Chaitin]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 1.6 in the first edition of Li &amp; Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications'', who cite Chaitin (1975): "this definition [of Kolmogorov complexity] was independently proposed about 1965 by A.N. Kolmogorov and me ... Both Kolmogorov and I were then unaware of related proposals made in 1960 by Ray Solomonoff."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The concept of [[packet switching]], a communications method in which discrete blocks of data ([[Packet (information technology)|packets]]) are [[routing|routed]] between [[node (networking)|nodes]] over data links, was first explored by [[Paul Baran]] in the early 1960s, and then independently a few years later by [[Donald Davies]].
* The principles of [[atomic layer deposition]], a thin-film growth method that in the 2000s contributed to the continuation of semiconductor-device scaling in accord with [[Moore's law]], were independently discovered in the early 1960s by the Soviet scientists [[Valentin Aleskovsky]] and Stanislav Koltsov and in 1974 by the Finnish inventor [[Tuomo Suntola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahvenniemi|first=Esko|last2=Akbashev|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Ali|first3=Saima|last4=Bechelany|first4=Mikhael|last5=Berdova|first5=Maria|last6=Boyadjiev|first6=Stefan|last7=Cameron|first7=David C.|last8=Chen|first8=Rong|last9=Chubarov|first9=Mikhail|date=2016-12-16|title=Review Article: Recommended reading list of early publications on atomic layer deposition—Outcome of the "Virtual Project on the History of ALD"|url=http://avs.scitation.org/doi/10.1116/1.4971389|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films|volume=35|issue=1|pages=010801|doi=10.1116/1.4971389|issn=0734-2101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puurunen|first=Riikka L.|date=2014-12-01|title=A Short History of Atomic Layer Deposition: Tuomo Suntola's Atomic Layer Epitaxy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cvde.201402012/abstract|journal=Chemical Vapor Deposition|language=en|volume=20|issue=10-11-12|pages=332–344|doi=10.1002/cvde.201402012|issn=1521-3862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malygin|first=Anatolii A.|last2=Drozd|first2=Victor E.|last3=Malkov|first3=Anatolii A.|last4=Smirnov|first4=Vladimir M.|date=2015-12-01|title=From V.

* [[Capital asset pricing model#Inventors|Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]] is a popular model in finance for trading off risk versus return.  Three separate authors published it in academic journals and a fourth circulated unpublished papers.
* 1963:  In a major advance in the development of [[plate tectonics theory]], the [[Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis]] was independently proposed by [[Lawrence Morley]], and by [[Fred Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]], linking [[seafloor spreading]] and the symmetric "zebra pattern" of [[magnetic reversals]] in the [[basalt]] rocks on either side of mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heirtzler |first=James R. |first2=Xavier |last2=Le Pichon |first3=J.

* [[Cosmic background radiation]] as a signature of the [[Big Bang]] was confirmed by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] of [[Bell Labs]].  Penzias and Wilson had been testing a very sensitive microwave detector when they noticed that their equipment was picking up a strange noise that was independent of the orientation (direction) of their instrument.  At first they thought the noise was generated due to pigeon droppings in the detector, but even after they removed the droppings the noise was still detected.  Meanwhile, at nearby [[Princeton University]] two physicists, [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] and [[Jim Peebles]], were working on a suggestion of [[George Gamow]]'s that the early universe had been hot and dense; they believed its hot glow could still be detected but would be so [[red shift|red-shifted]] that it would manifest as microwaves.  When [[Arno Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] learned about this, they realized that they had already detected the red-shifted microwaves and (to the disappointment of Dicke and Peebles) were awarded the 1978 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.&lt;ref name="Time, Bantam 1996, pp. 43-45" /&gt;
* 1964:  the relativistic model for the [[Higgs mechanism]] was developed by three independent groups:  [[Robert Brout]] and [[François Englert]]; [[Peter Higgs]]; and [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[Carl Richard Hagen]], and [[Tom Kibble]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Carrol, ''The Particle at the End of the Universe: The Hunt for the Higgs and the Discovery of a New World'', Dutton, 2012, p.228. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15744013-the-particle-at-the-end-of-the-universe]&lt;/ref&gt;  Slightly later, in 1965, it was also proposed by Soviet undergraduate students [[Alexander Migdal]] and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

Polyakov, [http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/dn/e_024_01_0091.pdf "Spontaneous Breakdown of Strong Interaction Symmetry and Absence of Massless Particles"], ''JETP'' '''51''', 135, July 1966 (English translation: ''Soviet Physics JETP'', '''24''', 1, January 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of the "[[Higgs boson]]" was finally confirmed in 2012; Higgs and Englert were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2013.
* The [[CYK algorithm|Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm]] was independently discovered three times: by T. Kasami (1965), by Daniel H. Younger (1967), and by [[John Cocke]] and Jacob T. Schwartz (1970).
* The [[Wagner–Fischer algorithm]], in [[computer science]], was discovered and published at least six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Navarro | first1 = Gonzalo| doi = 10.1145/375360.375365 | title = A guided tour to approximate string matching | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 31–88| year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/126168/Navarro_Gonzalo_Guided_tour.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}}
* The [[affine scaling]] method for solving [[linear programming]] was discovered by Soviet mathematician I.I. Dikin in 1967. It went unnoticed in the West for two decades, until two groups of researchers in the U.S. reinvented it in 1985.
* [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]] was introduced by a Japanese biologist, [[Motoo Kimura]], in 1968, and independently by two American biologists, [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Hughes Jukes]], in 1969. 
* In 1970, [[Howard Temin]] and [[David Baltimore]] independently discovered [[reverse transcriptase]] enzymes.
* The [[Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm|Knuth–Morris–Pratt]] [[string searching algorithm]] was developed by [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Vaughan Pratt]] and independently by [[J. H. Morris]].
* The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] (also known as "Cook's theorem"), a result in [[computational complexity theory]], was proven independently by [[Stephen Cook]] (1971 in the U.S.) and by [[Leonid Levin]] (1973 in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]). Levin was not aware of Cook's achievement because of communication difficulties between East and West during the [[Cold War]]. The other way round, Levin's work was not widely known in the West until around 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Garey &amp; Johnson, ''Computers and intractability'', p. 119.&lt;br /&gt;Cf. also the survey article by Trakhtenbrot (see "External Links").&lt;br /&gt;Levin emigrated to the U.S. in 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mevastatin]] (compactin; ML-236B) was independently discovered by Akira Endo in Japan in a culture of ''Penicillium citrinium''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endo | first1 = Akira | last2 = Kuroda | first2 = M. | last3 = Tsujita | first3 = Y. | year = 1976 | title = ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium".

* The [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]], a harmonic, non-octave musical scale, was independently discovered by [[Heinz Bohlen]] (1972), [[Kees van Prooijen]] (1978) and [[John R. Pierce]] (1984).
* [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], an algorithm suitable for [[digital signature|signing]] and [[encryption]] in [[public-key cryptography]], was publicly described in 1977 by [[Ron Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]] and [[Leonard Adleman]]. An equivalent system had been described in 1973 in an internal document by [[Clifford Cocks]], a British mathematician working for the UK intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], but his work was not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.
* [[Asymptotic freedom]], which states that the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]] between [[quarks]] decreases with decreasing distance, was discovered in 1973 by [[David Gross]] and [[Frank Wilczek]], and by [[David Politzer]], and was published in the same edition of the journal ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Gross, F. Wilczek, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v30/i26/p1343_1'' Ultraviolet behavior of non-abeilan gauge theoreies''], Physical Review Letters 30 (1973) 1343–1346;

* The [[J/ψ meson]] was independently discovered by a group at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], headed by [[Burton Richter]], and by a group at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], headed by [[Samuel Ting]] of [[MIT]]. Both announced their discoveries on November 11, 1974. For their shared discovery, Richter and Ting shared the 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].
* [[Endorphins]] were discovered independently in Scotland and the US in 1975.
* 1975:  two English biologists, Robin Holliday and John Pugh, and an American biologist, Arthur Riggs, independently suggested that [[methylation]], a chemical modification of [[DNA]] that is heritable and can be induced by [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]al influences, including physical and emotional [[Stress (biology)|stress]]es, has an important part in controlling [[gene expression]].  This concept has become foundational for the field of [[epigenetics]], with its multifarious implications for physical and [[mental health]] and for sociopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Rosenfield]] and [[Edward Ziff]], "[[Epigenetics]]:  The [[Evolution]] Revolution", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 10 (7 June 2018), pp. 36,38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quantum cryptography]]—the first [[cryptography|cryptographic method]] to rely not on mathematical complexity but on the laws of physics—was first postulated in 1984 by [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]], working together, and later independently, in 1991, by [[Artur Ekert]].  The earlier scheme has proven the more practical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Folger]], "The Quantum Hack:  Quantum computers will render today's cryptographic methods obsolete.  What happens then?" ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), pp. 50, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Comet Levy-Rudenko]] was discovered independently by [[David H. Levy]] on 13 November 1984 and the next evening by [[Michael Rudenko]].  (It was the first of 23 comets discovered by Levy, who is famous as the 1993 co-discoverer of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]], the first comet ever observed crashing into a planet, [[Jupiter]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[David H. Levy]], "My Life as a Comet Hunter:  The need to pass a French test, of all things, spurred half a century of cosmic sleuthing", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of [[elliptic curve]]s in [[cryptography]] ([[Elliptic curve cryptography]]) was suggested independently by [[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Victor S. Miller]] in 1985.
* The [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]], another fundamental result in computational complexity theory, was proven independently by [[Neil Immerman]] and [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html EATCS on the Gödel Prize 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804131454/https://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html |date=2007-08-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1989, [[Thomas R. Cech]] (Colorado) and [[Sidney Altman]] (Yale) won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[chemistry]] for their independent discovery in the 1980s of [[ribozyme]]s{{spaced ndash}}for the "discovery of catalytic properties of RNA"{{spaced ndash}}using different approaches. Catalytic RNA was an unexpected finding, something they were not looking for, and it required rigorous proof that there was no contaminating protein enzyme.
* In 1993, groups led by [[Donald S. Bethune]] at IBM and [[Sumio Iijima]] at NEC independently discovered [[Carbon nanotubes#Single-walled|single-wall]] [[carbon nanotubes]] and methods to produce them using transition-metal catalysts.
* [[Conductive polymers]]: Between 1963 and 1977, doped and oxidized highly conductive polyacetylene derivatives were independently discovered, "lost", and then rediscovered at least four times. The last rediscovery won the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry, for the "discovery and development of conductive polymers". This was without reference to the previous discoveries.

Terent'ev had discovered asymptotic freedom in [[quantum electrodynamics]] with charged vector field; and in 1969 [[Iosif Khriplovich]] had discovered asymptotic freedom in the [[SU(2)]] [[gauge theory]].  [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] in 1972 had also noted the effect but had not published it.)

There are yet [[Lists of unsolved problems|unsolved problems]] in [[neuroscience]], although some of these problems have evidence supporting a hypothesized solution, and the field is rapidly evolving. These problems include:

* [[Consciousness]]: What is the [[neural]] basis of [[subjective experience]], cognition, wakefulness, [[alertness]], [[arousal]], and [[attention]]? Is there a "[[hard problem of consciousness]]"? If so, how is it solved? What, if any, is the function of consciousness?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sejnowski, Terrence J. |author2=Hemmen, J.

* [[Perception]]: How does the [[brain]] transfer [[sense|sensory]] information into coherent, private percepts? What are the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] by which perception is organized? What are the features/[[Object (image processing)|objects]] that constitute our perceptual experience of internal and external events? How are the [[senses]] integrated? What is the relationship between subjective experience and the [[nature|physical]] world?
* [[Learning]] and [[memory]]: Where do our memories get stored and how are they retrieved again? How can learning be improved? What is the difference between [[explicit memory|explicit]] and [[implicit memory|implicit]] memories? What molecule is responsible for [[synaptic tagging]]?
* [[Neuroplasticity]]: How [[Neuroplasticity|plastic]] is the mature brain?
* [[Morphogenesis|Development]] and [[evolution]]: How and why did the brain [[Evolution|evolve]]? What are the [[molecular]] determinants of individual brain development?
* [[Free will]], particularly the [[neuroscience of free will]]
* [[Sleep]]: What is the biological function of sleep? Why do we [[dream]]? What are the underlying brain mechanisms? What is its relation to [[anesthesia]]?
* [[Cognition]] and [[Decision making|decisions]]: How and where does the brain evaluate [[Reward system|reward]] value and effort ([[cost]]) to modulate [[behavior]]? How does previous experience alter perception and behavior? What are the genetic and environmental contributions to brain function?
* [[Language]]: How is it implemented neurally? What is the basis of [[semantics|semantic]] [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]?
* [[Diseases]]: What are the neural bases (causes) of [[mind|mental]] diseases like psychotic disorders (e.g. [[mania]], [[schizophrenia]]), [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or [[Substance dependence|addiction]]? Is it possible to recover loss of sensory or motor function?
** One possible neural basis for mental illness is law integration disorder, a term coined by Johan Nygren, a Swedish gentleman who studied medicine and gene memes. While things like Parkinsons are easily explained medically by lack of dopamine, probably caused by environmental epigenetic effects like exposure to pesticides, other mental disorders lack a physiological basis. The theory of law integration disorder factors in the fight or flight response to coercion and explains these non-physiological mental illnesses as stress-induced phenomena.
*[[motor skill|Movement]]: How can we move so controllably, even though the motor nerve impulses seem haphazard and unpredictable?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=University of Copenhagen|title=Thinking With The Spinal Cord?|journal=ScienceDaily|date=24 January 2007|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070123143605.htm|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Computational theory of mind]]: What are the limits of understanding thinking as a form of computing?
*[[Computational neuroscience]]: How important is the precise timing of action potentials for information processing in the neocortex? Is there a canonical computation performed by cortical columns? How is information in the brain processed by the collective dynamics of large neuronal circuits? What level of simplification is suitable for a description of information processing in the brain? What is the neural code?
* How does [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|general anesthetic]] work?
* Neural computation: What are all the different types of [[neuron]] and what do they do in the human brain?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=406507214|title=A Database Of All Things Brainy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Noogenesis]] - the [[emergence]] and [[evolution]] of [[intelligence]]: What are the laws and mechanisms - of new [[idea]] emergence ([[insight]], creativity synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka effect|eureka]]); development (evolution) of an individual [[mind]] in the [[ontogenesis]], etc.?

'''Local density of states''' (LDOS) is a physical quantity that describes the [[density of states]], but space-resolved. In materials science, this term is useful when interpreting the data from an [[Scanning_tunneling_microscope|STM]], since this method is capable of imaging electron densities of states with atomic resolution. According to crystal's structure, this quantity can be predicted by computational methods, as for example with [[density functional theory]].

[[File:Omen ldos v3.gif|thumb|300px|right|Space resolved local density of states. A sequence of images with varying gate bias in a nanowire MOSFET at drain bias Vd=0.6V. Notice the confined energy levels as they move with increasing gate bias.]]
==LDOS in solid state devices==

Local density of states can be used to gain insights into a solid-state device. For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a [[transistor]] as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of bandedge. In the channel, the DOS is increasing as gate voltage increase and potential barrier goes down. 

In optics and photonics the concept of local density of states refers to the states that can be occupied by a photon. For light it is usually measured by fluorescence methods, near-field scanning methods or by cathodoluminescence techniques.

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess]] theatres as well as [[Wembley Stadium]],&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--reversal-of-fortune-a-21yearold-has-bold-new-plans-to-save-the-mermaid-theatre-charles-nevin-meets-the-man-with-a-mission-2316506.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Charles | last=Nevin | title=Reversal of fortune: A 21-year-old has bold new plans to save the Mermaid Theatre | date=30 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the [[Johnson Matthey]] bank collapse.&lt;ref name="Offstage drama at the Mermaid"&gt;{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Neviin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/captain-moonlight-offstage-drama-at-the-mermaid-1466921.html |title= Captain Moonlight: Offstage drama at the Mermaid|publisher=The Independent|access-date= 11 April 2018 |location=London |date= 12 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutlloyds.com/fraud/myth85.html |title=Not a Myth of Hindsight: 1085 |website=Truth About Lloyds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19891101&amp;id=jEVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1612,32433 |title=Prison for millionaire who lied |work=Glasgow Herald |date=1 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[Marc Sinden]] was appointed [[artistic director]] in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Atwood |title=Sinden vows Mermaid will rival West End |work=The Stage |date=12 August 1993 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001180/19930812/034/0005|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the next year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/facethefacts 3 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Roy Marsden]] and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

[[Meta-research]] aims to improve [[reproducibility]] by studying how science is practiced and published and developing better ways for the scientific community to operate.

The research institute has published a large statistical meta-analysis of studies on the effect of [[Stereotype threat]] on girls' mathematics performance. They also use methods for estimating  publication bias.&lt;ref name="Flore2014"/&gt;

The research institute has developed an [[R (programming language)|R based]] software tool that can detect incorrect statistical methods used in research articles.

'''''On Nature''''' was a [[philosophy|philosophical]] poem which details [[Anaximander]]'s theories about the [[evolution]] of the [[Earth]], [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[humankind]]. Anaximander described his theory that humans and other animals descended from fish once the world's oceans began to dry up. Also he described a theory of [[abiogenesis]] in his book in the way that he believed that the first life forms formed from mist. We know little about his book because it has been lost or destroyed, however it still remains important today because it describes one of the world's earliest theories of evolution.

'''Open science''' is the movement to make scientific research, data, and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente-Saez, R., &amp; Martinez-Fuentes, C. (2018). Open Science now: A systematic literature review for an integrated definition. Journal of Business Research, 88, 428-436.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.12.043&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses practices such as publishing [[open research]], campaigning for [[open access]], encouraging scientists to practice [[open notebook science]], and generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific knowledge.

Open Science can be seen as an continuation of, rather than a revolution in, practices begun in the 17th century with the advent of the [[academic journal]], when the societal demand for access to scientific knowledge reached a point at which it became necessary for groups of scientists to share resources&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15431919/Open_Science_Open_Issues Machado, J. "Open data and open science". ''In'' Albagli, Maciel &amp; Abdo. "Open Science, Open Questions", 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; with each other so that they could collectively do their work.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; In modern times there is debate about the extent to which scientific information should be shared.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=198-202}} The conflict that led to the Open Science movement is between the desire of scientists to have access to shared resources versus the desire of individual entities to profit when other entities partake of their resources.&lt;ref name="pauladavid"/&gt; Additionally, the status of [[open access]] and resources that are available for its promotion are likely to differ from one field of academic inquiry to another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openscience.com/|title=OpenScience|work=De Gruyter Open}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==

[[Science]] is broadly understood as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Proponents of open science identify a number of barriers that impede or dissuade the broad dissemination of scientific data.&lt;ref name="molloy"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molloy | first1 = J. C. | title = The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001195 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22162946 | pmc = 3232214 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These include financial [[paywall]]s of for-profit research publishers, restrictions on usage applied by publishers of data, poor formatting of data or use of proprietary software that makes it difficult to re-purpose, and cultural reluctance to publish data for fears of losing control of how the information is used.&lt;ref name="molloy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://im2punt0.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/defining-open-science-definitions/|title=Defining Open Science Definitions|last=Bosman|first=Jeroen|date=2017-03-26|website=I&amp;M / I&amp;O 2.0|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
The term "open science" does not have any one fixed definition or operationalization. On the one hand, it has been referred to as a "puzzling phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;David, P. A. (2008). The historical origins of ‘Open Science’: An essay on patronage, reputation and common agency contracting in the scientific revolution. Capitalism and Society, 3(2), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term has been used to encapsulate a series of principles that aim to foster scientific growth and its complementary access to the public. Two influential sociologists, Benedikt Fecher and Sascha Friesike, have created multiple "schools of thought" that describe the different interpretations of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fecher|first=Benedikt|last2=Friesike|first2=Sascha|year=2014|title=Open Science: One Term, Five Schools of Thought|url=http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/open_science_one_term_five_schools_of_thought.html|journal=Opening Science|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2|pages=17–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fecher and Friesike ‘Open Science’ is an umbrella term for various assumptions about the development and dissemination of knowledge. To show the term’s multitudinous perceptions, they differentiate between five Open Science schools of thought:

==== Infrastructure School ====

The infrastructure school is founded on the assumption that "efficient" research depends on the availability of tools and applications. Therefore, the "goal" of the school is to promote the creation of openly available platforms, tools, and services for scientists. Hence, the infrastructure school is concerned with the technical infrastructure that promotes the development of emerging and developing research practices through the use of the internet, including the use of software and applications, in addition to conventional computing networks. In that sense, the infrastructure school regards open science as a technological challenge.  The infrastructure school is tied closely with the notion of "cyberscience", which describes the trend of applying information and communication technologies to scientific research, which has led to an amicable development of the infrastructure school. Specific elements of this prosperity include increasing collaboration and interaction between scientists, as well as the development of "open-source science" practices. The sociologists discuss two central trends in the infrastructure school:

1. Distributed computing: This trend encapsulates practices that outsource complex, process-heavy scientific computing to a network of volunteer computers around the world.  The examples that the sociologists cite in their paper is that of the Open Science Grid, which enables the development of large-scale projects that require high-volume data management and processing, which is accomplished through a distributed computer network. Moreover, the grid provides the necessary tools that the scientists can use to facilitate this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altunay | first1 = M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = A science-driven production Cyberinfrastructure—the Open Science grid | url = | journal = Journal of Grid Computing | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 201–218 | doi = 10.1007/s10723-010-9176-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Social and Collaboration Networks of Scientists: This trend encapsulates the development of software that makes interaction with other researchers and scientific collaborations much easier than traditional, non-digital practices. Specifically, the trend is focused on implementing newer Web 2.0 tools to facilitate research related activities on the internet. De Roure and colleagues (2008) &lt;ref&gt;De Roure, D., et al. (2008). myExperiment: defining the social virtual research environment. In IEEE (pp. 182–189). Available at: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper. htm?arnumber=4736756.&lt;/ref&gt; list a series of four key capabilities which they believe comprises a Social Virtual Research Environment (SVRE): 
* The SVRE should primarily aid the management and sharing of research objects. The authors define these to be a variety of digital commodities that are used repeatedly by researchers. 
* Second, the SVRE should have inbuilt incentives for researchers to make their research objects available on the online platform. 
* Third, the SVRE should be "open" as well as "extensible", implying that different types of digital artifacts composing the SVRE can be easily integrated. 
* Fourth, the authors propose that the SVRE is more than a simple storage tool for research information.  Instead, the researchers propose that the platform should be "actionable". That is, the platform should be built in such a way that research objects can be used in the conduct of research as opposed to simply being stored.

==== Measurement School ====
The measurement school, in the view of the authors, deals with developing alternative methods to determine scientific impact. This school acknowledges that measurements of scientific impact are crucial to a researcher's reputation, funding opportunities, and career development. Hence, the authors argue, that any discourse about Open Science is pivoted around developing a robust measure of scientific impact in the digital age.  The authors then discuss other research indicating support for the measurement school. The three key currents of previous literature discussed by the authors are:

* The peer-review is described as being time-consuming. 
* The impact of an article, tied to the name of the authors of the article, is related more to the circulation of the journal rather than the overall quality of the article itself. 
* New publishing formats that are closely aligned with the philosophy of Open Science are rarely found in the format of a journal that allows for the assignment of the impact factor.

Hence, this school argues that there are faster impact measurement technologies that can account for a range of publication types as well as social media web coverage of a scientific contribution to arrive at a complete evaluation of how impactful the science contribution was. The gist of the argument for this school is that hidden uses like reading, bookmarking, sharing, discussing and rating are traceable activities, and these traces can and should be used to develop a newer measure of scientific impact. The umbrella jargon for this new type of impact measurements is called altmetrics, coined in a 2011 article by Priem et al., (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Priem, J., et al. (2011). Uncovering impacts: CitedIn and total-impact, two new tools for
gathering altmetrics (pp. 9–11). In iConference 2012. Available at: http://jasonpriem.org/selfarchived/
two-altmetrics-tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Markedly, the authors discuss evidence that altmetrics differ from traditional webometrics which are slow and unstructured. Altmetrics are proposed to rely upon a greater set of measures that account for tweets, blogs, discussions, and bookmarks. The authors claim that the existing literature has often proposed that altmetrics should also encapsulate the scientific process, and measure the process of research and collaboration to create an overall metric. However, the authors are explicit in their assessment that few papers offer methodological details as to how to accomplish this. The authors use this and the general dearth of evidence to conclude that research in the area of altmetrics is still in its infancy.

==== Public School ====

According to the authors, the central concern of the school is to make science accessible to a wider audience. The inherent assumption of this school, as described by the authors, is that the newer communication technologies such as Web 2.0 allow scientists to open up the research process and also allow scientist to better prepare their "products of research" for interested non-experts. Hence, the school is characterized by two broad streams: one argues for the access of the research process to the masses, whereas the other argues for increased access to the scientific product to the public.

* Accessibility to the Research Process:  Communication technology allows not only for the constant documentation of research but also promotes the inclusion of many different external individuals in the process itself.  The authors cite ''citizen science''- the participation of non-scientists and amateurs in research. The authors discuss instances in which gaming tools allow scientists to harness the brain power of a volunteer workforce to run through several permutations of protein-folded structures. This allows for scientists to eliminate many more plausible protein structures while also "enriching" the citizens about science. The authors also discuss a common criticism of this approach: the amateur nature of the participants threatens to pervade the scientific rigor of experimentation.
* Comprehensibility of the Research Result: This stream of research concerns itself with making research understandable for a wider audience. The authors describe a host of authors that promote the use of specific tools for scientific communication, such as microblogging services, to direct users to relevant literature. The authors claim that this school proposes that it is the obligation of every researcher to make their research accessible to the public.  The authors then proceed to discuss if there is an emerging market for brokers and mediators of knowledge that is otherwise too complicated for the public to grasp effortlessly.

==== Democratic School ====

The democratic school concerns itself with the concept of access to knowledge. As opposed to focusing on the accessibility of research and its understandability, advocates of this school focus on the access of products of research to the public. The central concern of the school is with the legal and other obstacles that hinder the access of research publications and scientific data to the public. The authors argue that proponents of this school assert that any research product should be freely available. The authors argue that the underlying notion of this school is that everyone has the same, equal right of access to knowledge, especially in the instances of state-funded experiments and data.  The authors categorize two central currents that characterize this school: Open Access and Open Data.

* Open Data: The authors discuss existing attitudes in the field that rebel against the notion that publishing journals should claim copyright over experimental data, which prevents the re-use of data and therefore lowers the overall efficiency of science in general. The claim is that journals have no use of the experimental data and that allowing other researchers to utilize this data will be fruitful. The authors cite other literature streams that discovered that only a quarter of researchers agree to share their data with other researchers because of the effort required for compliance. 
* Open Access to Research Publication: According to this school, there is a gap between the creation and sharing of knowledge. Proponents argue, as the authors describe, that even scientific knowledge doubles every 5 years, access to this knowledge remains limited. These proponents consider access to knowledge as a necessity for human development, especially in the economic sense.

==== Pragmatic School ====

The pragmatic school considers Open Science as the possibility to make knowledge creation and dissemination more efficient by increasing the collaboration throughout the research process. Proponents argue that science could be optimized by modularizing the process and opening up the scientific value chain. ‘Open’ in this sense follows very much the concept of [[open innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friesike | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Opening science: towards an agenda of open science in academia and industry | url = | journal = The Journal of Technology Transfer | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 581–601 | doi = 10.1007/s10961-014-9375-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Take for instance transfers the outside-in (including external knowledge in the production process) and inside-out (spillovers from the formerly closed production process) principles to science.&lt;ref&gt;Tacke, O., 2010. Open Science 2.0: How Research and Education Can Benefit from Open Innovation and Web 2.0. In T. J. Bastiaens, U. Baumöl, &amp; B. J. Krämer, eds. On Collective Intelligence. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 37–48..&lt;/ref&gt; [[Web 2.0]] is considered a set of helpful tools that can foster collaboration (sometimes also referred to as [[Science 2.0]]). Further, [[citizen science]] is seen as a form of collaboration that includes knowledge and information from non-scientists. Fecher and Friesike describe data sharing as an example of the pragmatic school as it enables researchers to use other researchers’ data to pursue new research questions or to conduct data-driven replications.

==History==
The widespread adoption of the institution of the [[scientific journal]] marks the beginning of the modern concept of open science. Before this time societies pressured scientists into secretive behaviors.

===Before journals===
Before the advent of scientific journals, scientists had little to gain and much to lose by publicizing scientific discoveries.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Many scientists, including [[Galileo]], [[Kepler]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[Robert Hooke]], made claim to their discoveries by describing them in papers coded in anagrams or cyphers and then distributing the coded text.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Their intent was to develop their discovery into something off which they could profit, then reveal their discovery to prove ownership when they were prepared to make a claim on it.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}}

The system of not publicizing discoveries caused problems because discoveries were not shared quickly and because it sometimes was difficult for the discoverer to prove priority. Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] both claimed [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy|priority in discovering calculus]].{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Newton said that he wrote about [[calculus]] in the 1660s and 1670s, but did not publish until 1693.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=172-175}} Leibniz published "[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]", a treatise on calculus, in 1684. Debates over priority are inherent in systems where science is not published openly, and this was problematic for scientists who wanted to benefit from priority.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

These cases are representative of a system of aristocratic patronage in which scientists received funding to develop either immediately useful things or to entertain.&lt;ref name="emergence"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = David | first1 = P. A. | title = Understanding the emergence of 'open science' institutions: Functionalist economics in historical context | doi = 10.1093/icc/dth023 | journal = Industrial and Corporate Change | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 571–589 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, funding of science gave prestige to the patron in the same way that funding of artists, writers, architects, and philosophers did.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; Because of this, scientists were under pressure to satisfy the desires of their patrons, and discouraged from being open with research which would bring prestige to persons other than their patrons.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt;

===Emergence of academies and journals===
Eventually the individual patronage system ceased to provide the scientific output which society began to demand.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; Single patrons could not sufficiently fund scientists, who had unstable careers and needed consistent funding.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; The development which changed this was a trend to pool research by multiple scientists into an academy funded by multiple patrons.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; In 1660 England established the [[Royal Society]] and in 1666 the French established the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt; Between the 1660s and 1793, governments gave official recognition to 70 other scientific organizations modeled after those two academies.&lt;ref name="emergence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClellan III|first=James E.|title=Science reorganized : scientific societies in the eighteenth century|year=1985|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-05996-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, [[Henry Oldenburg]] became the editor of [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]], the first [[academic journal]] devoted to science, and the foundation for the growth of scientific publishing.{{sfn|Groen|2007|p=215-216}} By 1699 there were 30 scientific journals; by 1790 there were 1052.{{sfn|Kronick|1976|p=78}} Since then publishing has expanded at even greater rates.{{sfn|Price|1986}}

=== Popular Science Writing ===
The first popular science periodical of its kind was published in 1872, under a suggestive name that is still a modern portal for the offering science journalism: Popular Science. The magazine claims to have documented the invention of the telephone, the phonograph, the electric light and the onset of automobile technology.  The magazine goes so far as to claim that the "history of Popular Science is a true reflection of humankind's progress over the past 129+ years".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-07/history-popular-science&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussions of popular science writing most often contend their arguments around some type of "Science Boom". A recent historiographic account of popular science traces mentions of the term"science boom" to Daniel Greenberg's Science and Government Reports in 1979 which posited that "Scientific magazines are bursting out all over. Similarly, this account discusses the publication Time, and its cover story of Carl Sagan in 1980 as propagating the claim that popular science has "turned into enthusiasm".&lt;ref&gt;Lewenstein, Bruce V. "Was there really a popular science "boom"?." Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 12.2 (1987): 29-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, this secondary accounts asks the important question as to what was considered as popular "science" to begin with. The paper claims that any account of how popular science writing bridged the gap between the informed masses and the expert scientists must first consider who was considered a scientist to begin with.

===Collaboration among academies===
In modern times many academies have pressured researchers at publicly funded universities and research institutions to engage in a mix of sharing research and making some technological developments proprietary.&lt;ref name="pauladavid"&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=Paul A.|title=Can "Open Science" be Protected from the Evolving Regime of IPR Protections?|journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics|date=March 2004|volume=160|issue=1|publisher=Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG|jstor=40752435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some research products have the potential to generate commercial revenue, and in hope of capitalizing on these products, many research institutions withhold information and technology which otherwise would lead to overall scientific advancement if other research institutions had access to these resources.&lt;ref name="pauladavid"/&gt; It is difficult to predict the potential payouts of technology or to assess the costs of withholding it, but there is general agreement that the benefit to any single institution of holding technology is not as great as the cost of withholding it from all other research institutions.&lt;ref name="pauladavid"/&gt;

===Coining of phrase "OpenScience"===
The exact phrase "Open Science" was coined by [[Steve Mann]] in 1998 at which time he also registered the domain name openscience.com and openscience.org which he sold to egruyter.com in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://who.is/domain-history/openscience.com|title=openscience.com historical whois information - who.is|website=who.is}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surveillance (oversight), Sousveillance (undersight), and Metaveillance (seeing sight itself), CVPR 2016, pages 1408-1417&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In many countries, governments fund some science research. Scientists often publish the results of their research by writing articles and donating them to be published in scholarly journals, which frequently are commercial. Public entities such as universities and libraries subscribe to these journals. [[Michael Eisen]],  a founder of the [[Public Library of Science]], has described this system by saying that "taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/opinion/research-bought-then-paid-for.html?_r=1 |title=Research Bought, Then Paid For |first=Michael |last=Eisen |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 January 2012 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, some United States legislators introduced a bill called the [[Research Works Act]], which would prohibit federal agencies from issuing grants with any provision requiring that articles reporting on taxpayer-funded research be published for free to the public online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Hot-Type-Who-Gets-to-See/130403/ |title=Who Gets to See Published Research?  |first=Jennifer |last=Howard |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Issa, a co-sponsor of the bill, explained the bill by saying that "Publicly funded research is and must continue to be absolutely available to the public. We must also protect the value added to publicly funded research by the private sector and ensure that there is still an active commercial and non-profit research community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-is-open-internet-champion-darrell-issa-supporting-an-attack-on-open-science/250929/ |title=Why Is Open-Internet Champion Darrell Issa Supporting an Attack on Open Science? - Rebecca J. Rosen |first=Rebecca J. |last=Rosen |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One response to this bill was protests from various researchers; among them was a boycott of commercial publisher [[Elsevier]] called [[The Cost of Knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/testify-the-open-science-movement-catches-fire/ |title=Testify: The Open-Science Movement Catches Fire |first=David |last=Dobbs |work=wired.com |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] called out for action in April 2016 to migrate European Commission funded research to Open Science. European Commissioner [[Carlos Moedas]] introduced the Open Science Cloud at the Open Science Conference in Amsterdam on
April 4–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/media/eu-wil-dat-onderzoekers-gegevens-meer-gaan-delen-in-eigen-datacloud~a4276263/|title=EU wil dat onderzoekers gegevens meer gaan delen in eigen datacloud|first=Martijn|last=Van Calmthout|work=|date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=8 April 2016|newspaper=De Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting also [[The Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science]] was presented, a living document outlining concrete actions for the European Community to move to Open Science.

===Arguments against===
[[File:To deposit or not to deposit, that is the question - journal.pbio.1001779.g001.png|thumb|The open sharing of research data is not widely practiced]]Arguments against open science tend to advance several concerns.  These include the potential for some scholars to capitalize on data other scholars have worked hard to collect, without collecting data themselves, the potential for less qualified individuals to misuse open data and arguments that novel data are more critical than reproducing or replicating older findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/jul/08/open-access-makes-no-sense|title=Why open access makes no sense|last=Osborne|first=Robin|date=2013-07-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/free-access-to-science-research-doesnt-benefit-everyone/383875/|title=Free Access to Science Research Doesn't Benefit Everyone|last=Eveleth|first=Rose|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Too much unsorted information overwhelms scientists

Some scientists find inspiration in their own thoughts by restricting the amount of information they get from others.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=198}} [[Alexander Grothendieck]] has been cited as a scientist who wanted to learn with restricted influence when he said that he wanted to "reach out in (his) own way to the things (he) wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of consensus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smolin|first=Lee|title=The trouble with physics : the rise of string theory, the fall of a science, and what comes next|year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-618-55105-7|edition=1st Mariner Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Potential misuse
In 2011, Dutch researchers announced their intention to publish a research paper in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' describing the creation of a strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 influenza]] which can be easily passed between [[ferret]]s, the mammals which most closely mimic the human response to the flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/scientists-brace-for-media-storm.html | title=Scientists Brace for Media Storm Around Controversial Flu Studies | date=November 23, 2011 | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=Enserink, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement triggered a controversy in both political&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/senior-us-lawmaker-leaps-into-h5.html | title=Senior U.S. Lawmaker Leaps Into H5N1 Flu Controversy | publisher=Science Insider - AAAS.ORG | date=March 4, 2012 | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=Malakoff, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/a-central-researcher-in-the-h5n1.html | title=A Central Researcher in the H5N1 Flu Debate Breaks His Silence | publisher=Science Insider - AAAS.ORG | date=January 25, 2012 | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=Cohen, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; circles about the ethical implications of publishing scientific data which could be used to create [[biological weapons]]. These events are examples of how science data could potentially be misused.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=200}} Scientists have collaboratively agreed to limit their own fields of inquiry on occasions such as the [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA]] in 1975,&lt;ref name=Crotty&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crotty|first1=Shane|title=Ahead of the curve : David Baltimore's life in science|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9780520239043|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeJhUa8xJIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} and a proposed 2015 worldwide moratorium on a human-genome-editing technique.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas|title=Scientists Seek Ban on Method of Editing the Human Genome|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/science/biologists-call-for-halt-to-gene-editing-technique-in-humans.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;The public will misunderstand science data
In 2009 NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft and promised that they would release collected data in June 2010. Later they decided to postpone release so that their scientists could look at it first. Their rationale was that non-scientists might unintentionally misinterpret the data, and NASA scientists thought it would be preferable for them to be familiar with the data in advance so that they could report on it with their level of accuracy.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=201}}
;Increasing the scale of science will make verification of any discovery more difficult
When more people report data it will take longer for anyone to consider all data, and perhaps more data of lower quality, before drawing any conclusion.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=202}}
;Low-quality science
Post-publication peer review, a staple of open science, has been criticized as promoting the production of lower quality papers that are extremely voluminous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronininstitute.org/open-science-and-its-discontents/1383/|title=Open Science and its Discontents - Ronin Institute|website=ronininstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, critics assert that as quality is not guaranteed by preprint servers, the veracity of papers will be difficult to assess by individual readers. This will lead to rippling effects of false science, akin to the recent epidemic of false news, propagated with ease on social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/tags/502124007/fake-news|title=Fake news|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common solutions to this problem have been cited as adaptations of a new format in which everything is allowed to be published but a subsequent filter-curator model is imposed to ensure some basic quality of standards are met by all publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewinnower.com/|title=The Winnower - Open Scholarly Publishing|website=thewinnower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments in favor===
A number of scholars across disciplines have advanced various arguments in favor of open science.  These generally focus on the perceived value of open science in improving the transparency and validity of research as well as in regards to public ownership of science, particularly that which is publicly funded.  For example, in January 2014 J. Christopher Bare published a comprehensive "Guide to Open Science".&lt;ref&gt;http://digitheadslabnotebook.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/guide-to-open-science.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in January, 2017, a group of scholars known for advocating open science published a "manifesto" for open science in the journal ''Nature.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munafò|first=Marcus R.|last2=Nosek|first2=Brian A.|last3=Bishop|first3=Dorothy V.

;Open access publication of research reports and data allows for rigorous peer-review
An article published by a team of NASA astrobiologists in 2010 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reported a [[bactera|bacterium]] known as [[GFAJ-1]] that could purportedly metabolize arsenic (unlike any previously known species of lifeform).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wolfe-Simon |first1= Felisa |authorlink= Felisa Wolfe-Simon |last2= Blum |first2= Jodi Switzer |last3=Kulp |first3=Thomas R. |last4=Gordon |first4=Gwyneth W. |last5=Hoeft |first5=Shelley E. |last6=Pett-Ridge |first6=Jennifer |last7=Stolz |first7=John F. |last8=Webb |first8=Samuel M. |last9=Weber |first9=Peter K. |last10=Davies |first10=P.

Much of the scientific commentary and critique around this issue took place in public forums, most notably on [[Twitter]], where hundreds of scientists and non-scientists created a [[hashtag|hashtag community]] around the hashtag #arseniclife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2011/05/the_discovery_of_arsenicbased_twitter.html | title=The Discovery of Arsenic-Based Twitter | publisher=Slate.com | date=May 27, 2011 | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=Zimmer, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of British Columbia astrobiologist Rosie Redfield, one of the most vocal critics of the NASA team's research, also submitted a draft of a research report of a study that she and colleagues conducted which contradicted the NASA team's findings; the draft report appeared in [[arXiv]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1201.6643| title=Absence of arsenate in DNA from arsenate-grown GFAJ-1 cells | date=January 31, 2012 |author1=M.

'''Open Science will make science more reproducible and transparent'''

Increasingly the reproducibility of science is being questioned and the term "[[reproducibility crisis]]" has been coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Peer Review and Reproducibility.

'''Open Science has more impact'''

There are several components to impact in research, many of which are hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Specials : Nature|url = http://www.nature.com/news/specials/impact/index.html|website = www.nature.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under traditional scientific metrics parts Open science such as Open Access and Open Data have proved to outperform traditional versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sharing Detailed Research Data Is Associated with Increased Citation Rate|url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-03-21|pmc = 1817752|pmid = 17375194|pages = e308|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000308|first = Heather A.|last = Piwowar|first2 = Roger S.|last2 = Day|first3 = Douglas B.|last3 = Fridsma|bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..308P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Alma. "The Open Access citation advantage: Studies and results to date." (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Science will help answer uniquely complex questions'''

Recent arguments in favor of Open Science have maintained that Open Science is a necessary tool to begin answering immensely complex questions, such as the neural basis of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXFB-SDCSX8|title=Big Science, Team Science &amp; Open Science to Understand Neocortex|first=|last=Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM)|date=19 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical argument propagates the fact that these type of investigations are too complex to be carried out by any one individual, and therefore, they must rely on a network of open scientists to be accomplished. By default, the nature of these investigations also makes this "open science" as "big science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/|title=Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) - National Institutes of Health (NIH)|website=www.braininitiative.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations and projects==

Big scientific projects are more likely to practice open science than small projects.{{sfn|Nielsen|2011|p=109}}  Different projects conduct, advocate, develop tools for, or fund open science, and many organizations run multiple projects.  For example, the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Why We Chose 'Open Science'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204630904577058162033028028|accessdate=6 January 2012|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducts numerous open science projects while the [[Center for Open Science]] has projects to conduct, advocate, and create tools for open science.  Open science is stimulating the emergence of sub-branches such as [[open synthetic biology]] and [https://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] &lt;ref&gt;https://static.therapoid.net/doc/The-Open-Therapeutics-mission-20171107.a17e0eabe333.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Organizations have extremely diverse sizes and structures.  The [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] (OKF) is a global organization sharing large data catalogs, running face to face conferences, and supporting open source software projects.  In contrast, [[Blue Obelisk]]  is an informal group of chemists and associated [[cheminformatics]] projects.  The tableau of organizations is dynamic with some organizations becoming defunct, e.g., [[Science Commons]], and new organizations trying to grow, e.g., the Self-Journal of Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjscience.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Common organizing forces include the knowledge domain, type of service provided, and even geography, e.g., [[OCSDNet]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsdnet.org|title=OCSDNET|website=OCSDNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; concentration on the developing world.

===Conduct===

Many open science projects focus on gathering and coordinating encyclopedic collections of large amounts of organized data.  The [[Allen Brain Atlas]] maps gene expression in human and mouse brains; [[the Encyclopedia of Life]] documents all the terrestrial species; the [[Galaxy Zoo]] classifies galaxies; the [[International HapMap Project]] maps the [[haplotype]]s of the human genome;  [[the Monarch Initiative]] makes available integrated public model organism and clinical data; and the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] which regularizes and publishes data sets from many sources.  All these projects accrete information provided by many different researchers with different standards of curation and contribution.

Other projects are organized around completion of projects that require extensive collaboration.  For example, [[OpenWorm]] seeks to make a cellular level simulation of a roundworm, a multidisciplinary project. The [[Polymath Project]] seeks to solve difficult mathematical problems by enabling faster communications within the discipline of mathematics.  The Collaborative Replications and Education project [https://osf.io/wfc6u/] recruits undergraduate students as [[Citizen Science|citizen scientists]] by offering funding.  Each project defines its needs for contributors and collaboration.

Another practical example for open science project was the first "open" doctoral thesis started in 2012. It was made publicly available as a self-experiment right from the start in order to examine whether this dissemination is even possible during the productive stage of scientific studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.helmholtz.de/en/science_and_society/a-discussion-about-transparency/|title=A discussion about transparency|website=www.helmholtz.de|publisher=[[Helmholtz Association]]|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The goal of the dissertation project: Publish everything related to the doctoral study and research process as soon as possible, as comprehensive as possible and under an open license, online available at all time for everyone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://offene-doktorarbeit.de/about-english/|title=About the first open PhD thesis|website=www.offene-doktorarbeit.de|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. End of 2017, the experiment was successfully completed and published in early 2018 as an open access book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Heise | first=Christian | date= 15 January 2018 | title= Von Open Access zu Open Science | url=https://meson.press/books/von-open-access-zu-open-science/ | location= Lüneburg, Germany | publisher= meson press e.G. | isbn=978-3-95796-130-3 | DOI=10.14619/1303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Advocacy===

Numerous documents, organizations, and social movements advocate wider adoption of open science.  Statements of principles include the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] from a December 2001 conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1818652.stm |title=Boost for research paper access |first=Ivan |last=Noble |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 February 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Panton Principles]]. New statements are constantly developed, such as the [[Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science]] to be presented to the Dutch [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in late May, 2016.  These statements often try to regularize licenses and disclosure for data and scientific literature.

Other advocates concentrate on educating scientists about appropriate open science software tools.  Education is available as training seminars, e.g., the Software Carpentry project [https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/]; as domain specific training materials, e.g., the Data Carpentry project [http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/]; and as materials for teaching graduate classes, e.g., the Open Science Training Initiative [http://www.opensciencetraining.com/index.php].  Many organizations also provide education in the general principles of open science.

Within scholarly societies there are also sections and interest groups that promote open science practices. The [[Ecological Society of America]] has an Open Science Section [http://esa.org/openscience/]. Similarly, the [[Society for American Archaeology]] has an Open Science Interest Group.&lt;ref name="marwick"/&gt;

===Publishing===

Replacing the current scientific publishing model is one goal of open science. High costs to access literature gave rise to protests such as [[The Cost of Knowledge]] and to sharing papers without publisher consent, e.g., [[Sci-hub]] and [[ICanHazPDF]]. New organizations are experimenting with [[open access journal|the open access model]]: the [[Public Library of Science]], or PLOS, is creating a library of open access journals and scientific literature; [[Faculty of 1000#F1000Research|F1000Research]] provides open publishing and open peer review for the life-sciences; [[figshare]] archives and shares images, readings, and other data; and [[arXiv]] provide electronic preprints across many fields; and [[List of open access journals|many individual journals]].  Other publishing experiments include [[delayed open access journal|delayed]] and [[hybrid open access journals|hybrid]] models.

===Software===

A variety of computer resources support open science.  These include software like the [[Open Science Framework]] from the [[Center for Open Science]] to manage project information, data archiving and team coordination; distributed computing services like [[Ibercivis]] to utilize unused CPU time for computationally intensive tasks; and services like [[Experiment (website)|Experiment.com]] to provide crowdsourced funding for research projects.

Blockchain platforms for open science have been proposed. The first such platform is the [http://oso.network Open Science Organization], which aims to solve urgent problems with fragmentation of the scientific ecosystem and difficulties of producing validated, quality science. Among the initiatives of Open Science Organization include the Interplanetary Idea System (IPIS), Researcher Index (RR-index), Unique Researcher Identity (URI), and Research Network. The Interplanetary Idea System is a blockchain based system that tracks the evolution of scientific ideas over time. It serves to quantify ideas based on uniqueness and importance, thus allowing the scientific community to identify pain points with current scientific topics and preventing unnecessary re-invention of previously conducted science. The Researcher Index aims to establish a data-driven statistical metric for quantifying researcher impact. The Unique Researcher Identity is a blockchain technology based solution for creating a single unifying identity for each researcher, which is connected to the researcher's profile, research activities, and publications. The Research Network is a social networking platform for researchers.

===Preprint Servers===
{{main|Preprint}}
Preprint Servers come in many varieties, but the standard traits across them are stable: they seek to create a quick, free mode of communicating scientific knowledge to the public. Preprint servers act as a venue to quickly disseminate research and vary on their policies concerning when articles may be submitted relative to journal acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv|title=Advancing the sharing of research results for the life sciences|website=www.biorxiv.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxivinfo.org/training|title=Copyright Training Resources {{!}} MarXiv|website=www.marxivinfo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also typical of preprint servers is their lack of a peer-review process - typically, preprint servers have some type of quality check in place to ensure a minimum standard of publication, but this mechanism is not the same as a peer-review mechanism. Some preprint servers have explicitly partnered with the broader open science movement.&lt;ref name="socopen.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socopen.org/2016/07/09/announcing-the-development-of-socarxiv-an-open-social-science-archive/|title=Announcing the development of SocArXiv, an open social science archive|date=9 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preprint servers can offer service similar to those of journals,&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, H. L., Hammond, P., Nordlander, P., &amp; Weiss, P. S. (2012). Prior Publication: Extended Abstracts, Proceedings Articles, Preprint Servers, and the Like.&lt;/ref&gt; and Google Scholar indexes many preprint servers and collects information about citations to preprints&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/accelerating-your-science-with-arxiv-and-google-scholar/|title=Accelerating Your Science with arXiv and Google Scholar|date=2012-11-29|work=An Assembly of Fragments|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The case for preprint servers is often made based on the slow pace of conventional publication formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moed | first1 = H. F. | year = 2007 | title = The effect of "open access" on citation impact: An analysis of ArXiv's Condensed matter section | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 13| pages = 2047–2054 | doi=10.1002/asi.20663| arxiv = cs/0611060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation to start Socarxiv, an open-access preprint server for social science research, is the claim that valuable research being published in traditional venues often times takes several months to years to get published, which slows down the process of science significantly. Another argument made in favor of preprint servers like Socarxiv is the quality and quickness of feedback offered to scientists on their pre-published work.&lt;ref&gt;
Binfield, P. (2014). Novel scholarly journal concepts. In Opening science (pp. 155-163). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of Socarxiv claim that their platform allows researchers to gain easy feedback from their colleagues on the platform, thereby allowing scientists to develop their work into the highest possible quality before formal publication and circulation. The founders of Socarxiv further claim that their platform affords the authors the greatest level of flexibility in updating and editing their work to ensure that the latest version is available for rapid dissemination. The founders claim that this is not traditionally the case with formal journals, which instate formal procedures to make updates to published articles{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Perhaps the strongest advantage of some preprint servers is their seamless compatibility with Open Science software such as the Open Science Framework. The founders of SocArXiv claim that their preprint server connects all aspects of the research life cycle in OSF with the article being published on the preprint server. According to the founders, this allows for greater transparency and minimal work on the authors' part.&lt;ref name="socopen.org"/&gt;

One criticism of pre-print servers is their potential to foster a culture of plagiarism. For example, the popular physics preprint server ArXiv had to withdraw 22 papers whence it came to light that they were plagiarized . In June 2002, a high-energy physicist in Japan was contacted by a man called Ramy Naboulsi, a non-institutionally affiliated mathematical physicist. Naboulsi requested Watanabe to upload his papers on ArXiv as he was not able to do so, because of his lack of an institutional affiliation. Later, the papers were realized to have been copied from the proceedings of a physics conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-nature-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/nature/journal/v426/n6962/full/426007a.html|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=www-nature-com.proxy.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preprint servers are increasingly developing measures to circumvent this plagiarism problem. In developing nations like India and China, explicit measures are being taken to combat it.&lt;ref&gt;Chaddah, P. (2016). On the need for a National Preprint Repository. Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy, 82(4), 1167-1170.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures usually involve creating some type of central repository for all available pre-prints, allowing the use of traditional plagiarism detecting algorithms to detect the fraud {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Nonetheless, this is a pressing issue in the discussion of pre-print servers, and consequently for Open Science.

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T. Lammerts van Bueren, 1997, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to health sciences:

'''Health sciences''' &amp;ndash; are those sciences which focus on health, or health care, as core parts of their subject matter. Because these two subject matter relate to multiple academic disciplines, both [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines as well as emerging [[patient safety]] disciplines (such as [[Social work|social care research]]) are relevant to current health scientific knowledge.

Health sciences knowledge bases are currently diverse, with intellectual foundations which are sometimes mutually-inconsistent. There is currently an existing bias in the field, towards high valuation of knowledge deriving from '''controlling''' views on human agency (as epitomized by the epistemological basis of [[Randomized controlled trial|Randomized Control Trial designs]]); compare this against the more '''naturalistic''' views on human agency taken by research based on [[Ethnography]] for example).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">'''Personoid''' is the concept coined by [[Stanislaw Lem]] (1971), a Polish science-fiction writer. His personoids are an abstraction of functions of human [[mind]] and they live in computers; they do not need any human-like physical body. 

In [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[software]] modeling, ''personoid'' is a research approach to the development of intelligent autonomous agents.
In frame of the IPK (Information, Preferences, Knowledge) architecture, it is a framework of abstract [[intelligent agent]] with a  cognitive and structural intelligence. It can be seen as an essence of high intelligent entities.

From the philosophical and [[systemics]] perspectives, personoid societies can also be seen as the [[Carrier (bearer)|carriers]] of a [[culture]]. According to N. Gessler, the personoids study can be a base for the research on ''[[artificial culture]]'' and ''culture evolution''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21294">The '''Peterson Field Guides''' (PFG) are a popular and influential series of [[United States|American]] [[field guide]]s intended to assist the [[layman]] in identification of birds, plants, insects and other natural phenomena. The series was created and edited by renowned [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] (1908–1996). His inaugural volume was the classic 1934 book ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', published (as were all subsequent volumes) by the [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].

The PFG series utilized what became known as the [[Peterson Identification System]], a practical method for field identification which highlights readily noticed visual features rather than focusing on the technical features of interest to scientists.  The series both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging [[environmental movement]].

Most books in this series use a section of plates of drawings (usually reduced from commissioned paintings) rather than photographs of the subject species, grouped at the center of the book. This allows for idealized portraits that highlight the identifying "field marks" of each species; such field marks are often indicated by arrows or straight lines in the plate illustrations. However, in several books in this series, the plates consist of photographs (usually without such arrows or indicators), such as in the guides for the atmosphere, coral reefs, rocks and minerals, and the (old Charles Covell 1984 guide to) Eastern moths. In many books in this series (especially older editions), a number of the plates are in black and white. For examples, older editions of the Eastern reptiles/amphibians book had many black and white plates which were colorized for the current edition,&lt;ref&gt;Conant, Roger; and Collins, Joseph. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1998 pp viii, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the original 1934 Eastern bird book had only 4 color plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |title=A Book-collector’s Guide to Roger Tory Peterson &amp;#124; Roger Tory Peterson Institute |publisher=Rtpi.org |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909003834/http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one book (insects) was entirely in black and white. However, most newer editions are often full-color (or almost full-color) and tend to be larger. One source claims that the increased size of one of the new editions (Eastern reptiles/amphibians) was considered detrimental to its use as a field guide by its own author and was a publisher decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/78484/in_memoriam_roger_conant_19092003_with_reflections_by_some_of/ |title=In Memoriam: Roger Conant (1909-2003) With Reflections By Some of Roger's Many Friends and Colleagues - Science News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, new "editions" in this series are entirely new books with completely new texts and illustrations. For example, the fourth edition of the mammals guide has an entirely new text and illustrations by new author Fiona Reid, because the author (William Burt) and illustrator (Richard Grossenheider) of previous editions are both deceased. In fact, Grossenheider died prior to the publication of the ''previous'' third edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, William H; and Grossenheider, Richard P. A Field Guide to the Mammals of North America North of Mexico. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co; 1976. p vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the current Northeastern moths guide by David Beadle and Seabrooke Leckie is an entirely new book than the out-of-print 1984 Eastern moths guide by Charles Covell.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seabrookeleckie.com/the-new-peterson-moth-guide/ |title=The new Peterson moth guide |publisher=Seabrooke Leckie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beadle/Leckie book covers a smaller geographical area and (one author claims) covers moths in greater detail.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt; The old Covell book has been out-of-print for many years, but is currently available through the Virginia Museum of Natural History (which purchased the rights to that book).&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmnh.net/news.cfm?ID=193 |title=What's New &amp;#124; Virginia Museum of Natural History |publisher=Vmnh.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above situation of an old "edition" persisting alongside its intended replacement edition is not unique to the Eastern moths guide. [[George A. Petrides|George Petrides]]' 1988 Eastern trees book (PFG11B) was originally intended to replace Petrides' own 1958 Eastern tree and shrubs (PFG11A) book. However, both books remain popular and the original publisher still offers both books for sale (unlike the case of the old Eastern moths book).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmhbooks.com/peterson/plants.cfm |title=Peterson Field Guides(R)- Birds |publisher=Hmhbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between editions can serve to indicate changes in scientific perspective as well as changes species distribution. For example, the second edition of the freshwater fishes guide by Page and Burr (2011), published 20 years after the first edition, increased the number of species included from 768 to 909, largely due to the addition of previously unrecognized species (114), as well as increased numbers of newly established exotic species (16).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/freshwater/fieldguide.html Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes" Florida Museum of Natural History.] flmnh.ufl.edu. Retrieved 2014-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded coverage of marine fish commonly found in freshwater (19).

'''Pheme''' is a 36-month research project into establishing the veracity of claims made on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists develop a lie detector for tweets|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/10647974/Scientists-develop-a-lie-detector-for-tweets.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Unverified content is dominant and prolific in [[social media]] messages. While big data typically presents challenges in its information volume, variety and velocity, social media presents a fourth: establishing veracity. The Pheme project aims to analyse content in real time and determine how accurate the claims made in it are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Plan Lie-Detector For Tweets|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1214023/scientists-plan-lie-detector-for-tweets|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As claims propagate through a [[social network]], each individual chooses whether or not to pass on information, based on how accurate they think it is. Analysing the [[natural language processing|language]] used and the spread of information through a network, as well as the spatial and temporal context of the information, is used to build a real-time lie detector for social media. This will help, for example, emergency services (who already integrate social media as part of their alerting and response systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power|first=Robert|title=Finding Fires with Twitter|journal=Proceedings Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2013|year=2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Earle|first=Paul S|title=Twitter earthquake detection: earthquake monitoring in a social world|journal=Annals of Geophysics|year=2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to flag potential hoax emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers working on social media 'lie detector'|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/528436|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluating the authority of sources automatically is also a project goal, based on the treatment of the news and information that comes from them. For example, a tweet of a [[BBC]] news article would hold more weight than one from an unknown source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers are working on a lie detector to sniff out false tweets|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/19/twitter-lie-detector/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is named after the Greek goddess [[Pheme]].

==Case studies==
Pheme addresses social media lies in two scenarios: information about healthcare, which can be particularly damaging if wrong, and information used by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU project to build lie detector for social media|url=http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/lie-detector-social-media-sheffield-twitter-facebook-1.354715|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Categories of rumour==
Pheme addresses [[speculation]], [[controversy]], [[misinformation]] and [[disinformation]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie detector on the way to test social media rumours|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26263510|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==

The project is a partnership between the [[University of Sheffield]] as part of [[General Architecture for Text Engineering|GATE]], the [[University of Warwick]], [[King's College London]], [[Saarland University]] in Germany and [[MODUL University Vienna]]. Four companies are also taking part - [[Atos]], [[iHub|iHub Nairobi]], [[Ontotext]] and [[swissinfo]]. Pheme is funded by the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pheme.eu/|title=Pheme: Computing Veracity – the Fourth Challenge of Big Data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11414">The '''Polymath Project''' is a collaboration among [[mathematician]]s to solve important and difficult [[Mathematics|mathematical]] problems by coordinating many mathematicians to communicate with each other on finding the best route to the solution. The project began in January 2009 on [[Timothy Gowers]]' blog when he posted a problem and asked his readers to post partial ideas and partial progress toward a solution.&lt;ref name="reinventing" /&gt; This experiment resulted in a new answer to a difficult problem, and since then the Polymath Project has grown to describe a particular process of using an online collaboration to solve any math problem.

==Origin==
In January 2009, Gowers chose to start a [[social experiment]] on his [[blog]] by choosing an important unsolved mathematical problem and issuing an invitation for other people to help solve it collaboratively in the comments section of his blog.&lt;ref name="reinventing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=[[Reinventing discovery : the new era of networked science]]|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14890-8|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the math problem itself, Gowers asked a question which was included in the title of his blog post, "is massively collaborative mathematics possible?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gowers|first=Tim|title=Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/|work=Gowers' weblog|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowers | first1 = T. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/461879a | title = Massively collaborative mathematics | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7266 | pages = 879–881 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19829354 | pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..879G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This post led to his creation of the Polymath Project.

==Projects for high school and college==
Since its inception, it has now sponsored a "[https://artofproblemsolving.com/polymath Crowdmath]" project in collaboration with [[MIT PRIMES]] program and the [[Art of Problem Solving]]. This project is built upon the same idea of the Polymath project that massive collaboration in mathematics is possible and possibly quite fruitful. However, this is specifically aimed at only high school and college students with a goal of creating "a specific opportunity for the upcoming generation of math and science researchers." The problems are original research and unsolved problems in mathematics. All high school and college students from around the world with advanced background of mathematics are encouraged to participate. Older participants are welcomed to participate as mentors and encouraged not to post solutions to the problems. The first Crowdmath project began on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Crowdmath" project for high school students opens on March 1|url=http://polymathprojects.org/2016/01/02/crowdmath-project-for-high-school-students-opens-on-march-1/|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CROWDMATH|url=http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/polymath/mitprimes2016/f/c195578h1177036_welcome_to_crowdmath|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems solved==

===Polymath1===
The initial proposed problem for this project, now called Polymath1 by the Polymath community, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the [[Hales–Jewett theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gowers |first=Tim |title=A combinatorial approach to density Hales-Jewett |date=1 February 2009 |work=Gower's Weblog |url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/a-combinatorial-approach-to-density-hales-jewett/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the project took form, two main threads of discourse emerged. The first thread, which was carried out in the comments of Gowers's blog, would continue with the original goal of finding a combinatorial proof.  The second thread, which was carried out in the comments of [[Terence Tao]]'s blog, focused on calculating bounds on density of [[Hales-Jewett number]]s and [[Moser number]]s for low dimensions.

After seven weeks, Gowers announced on his blog that the problem was "probably solved",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=584|title=The Polymath project: scope of participation|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though work would continue on both Gowers's thread and Tao's thread well into May 2009, some three months after the initial announcement.  In total over 40 people contributed to the Polymath1 project. Both threads of the Polymath1 project have been successful, producing at least two new papers to be published under the [[pseudonym]] '''D.H.J. Polymath''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1009.3956|author1=Polymath|title=Deterministic methods to find primes|class=math.NT|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1002.0374|author1=Polymath|title=Density Hales-Jewett and Moser numbers|class=math.CO|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0910.3926|author1=Polymath|title=A new proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem|class=math.CO|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the initials refer to the problem itself ('''d'''ensity '''H'''ales-'''J'''ewett).

===Polymath5===
This project was set up in order to try to solve the [[Erdős discrepancy problem]]. It was active for much of 2010 and had a brief revival in 2012, but did not end up solving the problem. However, in September 2015, [[Terence Tao]], one of the participants of Polymath5, solved the problem in a pair of papers. One paper proved an averaged form of the Chowla and Elliott conjectures, making use of recent advances in analytic number theory concerning correlations of values of multiplicative functions. The other paper showed how this new result, combined with some arguments discovered by Polymath5, were enough to give a complete solution to the problem. Thus, Polymath5 ended up making a significant contribution to the solution.

===Polymath8===
The Polymath8 project&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes Polymath8 project].&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed to improve the bounds for small gaps between primes. It has two components:

* Polymath8a, "Bounded gaps between primes", was a project to improve the bound H=H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the least gap between consecutive primes that was attained infinitely often, by developing the techniques of [[Yitang Zhang]]. This project concluded with a bound of H = 4,680.
* Polymath8b, "Bounded intervals with many primes", was a project to improve the value of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; further, as well as H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (the least gap between primes with m-1 primes between them that is attained infinitely often), by combining the Polymath8a results with the techniques of [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]]. This project concluded with a bound of H=246, as well as additional bounds on H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

Both components of the Polymath8 project have been successful, producing two new papers, one of which was published under the pseudonym '''D.H.J. Polymath'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|doi=10.2140/ant.2014.8.2067|title=New equidistribution estimates of Zhang type|year=2014|volume=8|journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory|pages=2067–2199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|title=Variants of the Selberg sieve, and bounded intervals containing many primes|doi=10.1186/s40687-014-0012-7|year=2014|volume=1|journal=Research in the Mathematical Sciences|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PubRef''' is a composition and project management application used by researchers and students for [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scholarly writing]] and [[Scholarly communication|communication]].  PubRef uses an extended form of [[Markdown]]  as a primary authoring format and converts this to [[Journal Article Tag Suite|JATS]], the archive format used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|US National Library of Medicine]].

==Research asset containerization==

Researchers manage scholarly writing projects within version-controlled file repositories called ''containers'' that function similarly to [[Repository (version control)|git repositories]] and [[Docker (software)|docker containers]] to provide enhanced [[reproducibility]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[Reusability|re-usability]] in digital science publishing.

==Manuscript writing==

A PubRef manuscript is a Markdown file within a ''container'' that contains extra embedded information that describes the essential front matter elements of a scholarly manuscript such as the [[Title (publishing)|title]], [http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/running-heads/ short title], [[Author|list of authors]], [http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/prep_init.xhtml author affiliations], [[Index term|keywords]].  This information is captured in embedded [[YAML]] blocks within the primary manuscript called ''Meta''.  Figures, tables, equations and other special content can be similarly embedded within the context of the document via ''Meta'' descriptors.

==Minimal example==

This minimal formatting example repurposes a classic paper by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose ''The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology'' &lt;ref name="Auto2J-7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1970.0021 |first=Stephen |last=Hawking |last2=Penrose |first2=Roger |year=1970 |title=The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=314 |issue=1519 |pages=529–548 |bibcode=1970RSPSA.314..529H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cycle of Research and Development.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Cycle of research and development]]

'''Research and development''' ('''R&amp;D,''' '''R+D,''' or '''R'n'D'''), also known in [[Europe]] as '''research and technological development''' ('''RTD'''), refers to innovative activities undertaken by corporations or governments in developing new services or products, or improving existing services or products.&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp|title=Research And Development – R&amp;D|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research]] and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or the production process.

R&amp;D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt; of an R&amp;D department either staffed by [[engineers]] and tasked with directly [[new product development|developing new products]], or staffed with [[applied science|industrial scientists]] and tasked with [[applied research]] in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&amp;D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain [[return on investment]]. However R&amp;D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketisation of new products.&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt;

==Background==
New product design and development is often a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&amp;D program, a firm must rely on [[strategic alliance]]s, [[acquisitions]], and networks to tap into the innovations of others.

A system driven by [[marketing]] is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell.{{cn|date=March 2017}} [[Market research]] is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential [[niche market]] of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&amp;D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In general, research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company, or can be [[out-sourced]] to a contract research organization, [[universities]], or [[sovereign state|state]] agencies.{{cn|date=March 2017}} In the context of [[commerce]], "research and development" normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in [[science]] or [[technology]], using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yield.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

[[Statistics]] on organizations devoted to "R&amp;D" may express the state of an [[industry]], the degree of [[competition]] or the lure of [[scientific progress|progress]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} Some common measures include: [[budget]]s, numbers of [[patent]]s or on rates of peer-reviewed [[publication]]s. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are continuously maintained, public and reflect risk.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In the United States, a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called "[[R&amp;D intensity]]".{{cn|date=March 2017}} A [[high technology]] company, such as a computer manufacturer, might spend 7% or a [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] such as [[Merck &amp; Co.]] 14.1% or [[Novartis]] 15.1%. Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as  engineering company [[Ericsson]] 24.9%, or [[Allergan]] a [[biotech]] company,  tops the spending table with 43.4% investment&lt;ref name="fn_2"&gt; All figures [http://www.innovation.gov.uk/rd_scoreboard/ UK R&amp;D Scoreboard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027005836/http://www.innovation.gov.uk/rd_scoreboard/ |date=2005-10-27 }} {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such companies are often seen as [[credit risk]]s because their spending ratios are so unusual.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs, like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals, [[scientific instrument]]s, and [[safety-critical system]]s in medicine, [[aeronautics]] or [[military weapons]]. {{cn|date=March 2017}}The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues.{{cn|date=March 2017}} That is, [[gross profit]]s will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of [[amortizing loan|amortizing]] the high overhead.{{cn|date=March 2017}} They often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications, specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic designs and mechanical subsystems.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Research from 2000 has shown that firms with a persistent R&amp;D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&amp;D investment program.&lt;ref name="rdt"&gt;{{cite web | last = Johansson | last2 = Lööf | title = The Impact of Firm's R&amp;D Strategy on Profit and Productivity|date=December 2008 | url = http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:487391/FULLTEXT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business R&amp;D==
Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, "higher R&amp;D spending does not guarantee more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerospace and Defense: Inventing and Selling the Next Generation|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/090520_diig_aerospace.pdf|website=Center for Strategic and International Studies|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies, International Security Program|accessdate=6 August 2017|pages=1|language=English|format=pdf|date=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor-partner.co.uk/business-dictionary/42/invention-finance |title=Investor-partner business partner finder Business dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way entrepreneurs can reduce these uncertainties is to buy the licence for a franchise, so that the [[know-how]] is already incorporated in the licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor-partner.co.uk/business-dictionary/41/know-how-finance |title=Investor-partner business partner finder Business dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit by sector===
In general, it has been found that there is a positive [[correlation]] between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors, but that this positive correlation is much stronger in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ortega-Argiles |first=Raquel |last2=Potters |first2=Lesley |last3=Vivarelli |first3=Marco |date=2011 |title=R&amp;D and productivity: testing sectoral peculiarities using micro data |url= |journal=Empirical Economics |publisher= |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=817–839 |doi= 10.1007/s00181-010-0406-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ortega-Argiles |first=Raquel |last2=Piva |first2=Mariacristina |last3=Vivarelli |first3=Marco |date=2011 |title=Productivity Gains from R&amp;D Investment: Are High-Tech Sectors Still Ahead? |url= |journal=IZA Discussion Papers |publisher=IZA |volume= |issue=5975 |pages=1–22 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In research done by Francesco Crespi and Cristiano Antonelli, high-tech firms were found to have "virtuous" [[Matthew effect]]s while low-tech firms experienced "vicious" Matthew effects, meaning that high-tech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while low-tech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition, even if not put to good use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crespi |first=Francesco |last2=Antonelli |first2=Cristiano |date=2011 |title=Matthew Effects and R&amp;D Subsidies: Knowledge Cumulability in High-Tech and Low-Tech Industries |url= |journal=Working Papers |publisher=Università degli Studi Roma Tre |volume= |issue=140 |pages=1–24 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the strength of the correlation between R&amp;D spending and productivity in low-tech industries is less than in high-tech industries, studies have been done showing non-trivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by low-tech R&amp;D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendonca |first=Sandro |date=2009 |title=Brave Old World: Accounting for 'High-Tech' Knowledge in 'Low-Tech' Industries |url= |journal=Research Policy |publisher= |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=470–482 |doi= 10.1016/j.respol.2008.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global===
[[Global R&amp;D management]] is the discipline of designing and leading R&amp;D processes globally, across cultural and lingual settings, and the transfer of knowledge across international corporate networks.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, V. (2001). R&amp;D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government expenditures==

===United States===
President [[Barack Obama]] requested $147.696 billion for research &amp; development in [[Fiscal year|FY]]2012, of which 21% was destined to fund basic research.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41098.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

===European Union===
Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], based on the [[Europe 2020]] strategy which will run from 2014 to 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-848_en.htm?locale=en|title=European Commission – PRESS RELEASES  – Press release – Horizon 2020: Commission proposes €80 billion investment in research and innovation, to boost growth and jobs|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multidisciplinary effort to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire value chain of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02013R1291-20150704|title=EUR-Lex – 02013R1291-20150704 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldwide===
In 2015, research and development constituted an average 2.2% of the [[global GDP]] according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS|title=Research and development expenditure (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29336">'''Science, technology, society and environment''' ('''STSE''') '''education''', originates from the [[Science and technology studies|science technology and society (STS)]] movement in [[science education]]. This is an outlook on science education that emphasizes the teaching of scientific and technological developments in their cultural, economic, social and political contexts. In this view of science education, students are encouraged to engage in issues pertaining to the impact of science on everyday life and make responsible decisions about how to address such issues (Solomon, 1993 and Aikenhead, 1994)

==Science technology and society (STS)==

[[File:ScienceOlympiad.jpg|200 px|right]]
The STS movement has a long history in science education reform, and embraces a wide range of theories about the intersection between science, technology and society (Solomon and Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti 1997). Over the last twenty years, the work of Peter Fensham, the noted Australian science educator, is considered to have heavily contributed to reforms in science education. Fensham's efforts included giving greater prominence to STS in the school science curriculum (Aikenhead, 2003). The key aim behind these efforts was to ensure the development of a broad-based science curriculum, embedded in the socio-political and cultural contexts in which it was formulated. From Fensham's point of view, this meant that students would engage with different viewpoints on issues concerning the impact of science and technology on everyday life. They would also understand the relevance of scientific discoveries, rather than just concentrate on learning scientific facts and theories that seemed distant from their realities (Fensham, 1985 &amp; 1988).

[[File:pollution de l'air.jpg|200 px|left]]

However, although the wheels of change in science education had been set in motion during the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that STS perspectives began to gain a serious footing in science curricula, in largely Western contexts (Gaskell, 1982). This occurred at a time when issues such as, [[animal testing]], [[environmental pollution]] and the growing impact of technological innovation on social infrastructure, were beginning to raise ethical, moral, economic and political dilemmas (Fensham, 1988 and Osborne, 2000). There were also concerns among communities of researchers, educators and governments pertaining to the general public's lack of understanding about the interface between science and society (Bodmer, 1985; Durant ''et al.'' 1989 and Millar 1996).  In addition, alarmed by the poor state of [[scientific literacy]] among school students, science educators began to grapple with the quandary of how to prepare students to be informed and active citizens, as well as the scientists, medics and engineers of the future (e.g. Osborne, 2000 and Aikenhead, 2003). Hence, STS advocates called for reforms in science education that would equip students to understand scientific developments in their cultural, economic, political and social contexts. This was considered important in making science accessible and meaningful to all students—and, most significantly, engaging them in real world issues (Fensham, 1985; Solomon, 1993; Aikenhead, 1994 and Hodson 1998).

==Goals of STS==

The key goals of STS are:

[[File:waste dumping in a slum of Cap-Haitien.jpg|200 px|right]]

==STSE education==

[[File:canal-pollution.jpg|150 px|right]]

There is no uniform definition for STSE education. As mentioned before, STSE is a form of STS education, but places greater emphasis on the environmental consequences of scientific and technological developments. In STSE curricula, scientific developments are explored from a variety of economic, environmental, ethical, moral, social and political (Kumar and Chubin, 2000 &amp; Pedretti, 2005) perspectives.

At best, STSE education can be loosely defined as a movement that attempts to bring about an understanding of the interface between science, society, technology and the environment. A key goal of STSE is to help students realize the significance of scientific developments in their daily lives and foster a voice of active citizenship (Pedretti &amp; Forbes, 2000).

===Improving scientific literacy ===
Over the last two decades, STSE education has taken a prominent position in the  science curricula of different parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, the UK and USA  (Kumar &amp; Chubin, 2000). In Canada, the inclusion of STSE perspectives in science education has largely come about as a consequence of the ''Common Framework of science learning outcomes, Pan Canadian Protocol for collaboration on School Curriculum (1997)''[http://www.cmec.ca/science/framework]. This document highlights a need to develop scientific literacy in conjunction with understanding the interrelationships between science, technology, and environment.  According to Osborne (2000) &amp; Hodson (2003), scientific literacy can be perceived in four different ways:

*'''Cultural''': Developing the capacity to read about and understand issues pertaining to science and technology in the media.
*'''Utilitarian''': Having the knowledge, skills and attitudes that are essential for a career as scientist, engineer or technician.
*'''Democratic''': Broadening knowledge and understanding of science to include the interface between science, technology and society.
*'''Economic''': Formulating knowledge and skills that are essential to the economic growth and effective competition within the global market place.

However, many science teachers find it difficult and even damaging to their professional identities to teach STSE as part of science education due to the fact that traditional science focuses on established scientific facts rather than philosophical, political, and social issues, the extent of which many educators find to be devaluing to the scientific curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/ihpst07/proceedings/IHPST07%20papers/117%20Pedretti.pdf] - Promoting Issues-based STSE Perspectives in Science Teacher Education: Problems of Identity and Ideology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale and goals===
In the context of STSE education, the goals of teaching and learning are largely directed towards engendering cultural and democratic notions of scientific literacy. Here, advocates of STSE education argue that in order to broaden students' understanding of science, and better prepare them for active and responsible citizenship in the future, the scope of science education needs to go beyond learning about scientific theories, facts and technical skills. Therefore, the fundamental aim of STSE education is to equip students to understand and situate scientific and technological developments in their cultural, environmental, economic, political and social contexts (Solomon &amp; Aikenhead, 1994; Bingle &amp; Gaskell, 1994; Pedretti 1997 &amp; 2005).  For example, rather than learning about the facts and theories of weather patterns, students can explore them in the context of issues such as global warming. They can also debate the environmental, social, enconomic and political consequences of relevant legislation, such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. This is thought to provide a richer, more meaningful and relevant canvas against which scientific theories and phenomena relating to weather patterns can be explored (Pedretti ''et al.'' 2005).

In essence, STSE education aims to develop the following skills and perspectives (Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti, 1996; Alsop &amp; Hicks, 2001):

*Social responsibility
*Critical thinking and decision making skills
*The ability to formulate sound ethical and moral decisions about issues arising from the impact of science on our daily lives
*Knowledge, skills and confidence to express opinions and take responsible action to address real world issues

===Curriculum content===
Since STSE education has multiple facets, there are a variety of ways in which it can be approached in the classroom. This offers teachers a degree of flexibility, not only in the incorporation of STSE perspectives into their science teaching, but in integrating other curricular areas such as history, geography, social studies and language arts (Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001). The table below summarizes the different approaches to STSE education described in the literature (Ziman, 1994 &amp; Pedretti, 2005):

===Summary table: Curriculum content===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Approach'''
! '''Description'''
! '''Example'''
|-
| '''Historical'''
|A way of humanizing science. This approach examines the history of science through concrete examples, and is viewed as way of demonstrating the fallibility of science and scientists.  
|Learning about inventions or scientific theories through the lives and worlds of famous scientist. Students can research their areas of interest and present them through various activities: e.g. drama-role play, debates or documentaries. Through this kind of exploration, students examine the values, beliefs and attitudes that influenced the work of scientists, their outlook on the world, and how their work has impacted our present circumstances and understanding of science today.
|-
| '''Philosophical'''
|Helps students formulate an understanding of the different outlooks on the nature of science, and how differing viewpoints on the nature and validity of scientific knowledge influence the work of scientists—demonstrating how society directs and reacts to scientific innovation.
|Using historical narratives or stories of scientific discoveries to concretely examine philosophical questions and views about science. For example, “The Double Helix” by [[James D. Watson]] is an account of the discovery of DNA. This historical narrative can be used to explore questions such as: “What is science? What kind of research was done to make this discovery? How did this scientific development influence our lives? Can science help us understand everything about our world?”  Such an exploration reveals the social and historical context of philosophical debates about the nature of science—making this kind of inquiry concrete, meaningful and applicable to students’ realities. 
|-
|'''Issues-based'''
|This is the most widely applied approach to STSE education. It stimulates an understanding of the science behind issues, and the consequences to society and the environment. A multi-faceted approach to examining issues highlights the complexities of real-life debates. Students also become aware of the various motives for decisions that address environmental issues.
|Real life events within the community, at the national or international level, can be examined from political, economic, ethical and social perspectives through presentations, debates, role-play, documentaries and narratives. Real life events might include: the impact of environmental legislations, industrial accidents and the influence of particular scientific or technological innovations on society and the environment.

===Opportunities and challenges of STSE education===

Although advocates of STSE education keenly emphasize its merits in science education, they also recognize inherent difficulties in its implementation. The opportunities and challenges of STSE education have been articulated by Hughes (2000) and Pedretti &amp; Forbes, (2000), at five different levels, as described below:

'''Values &amp; beliefs:''' The goals of STSE education may challenge the values and beliefs of students and teachers—as well as conventional, culturally entrenched views on scientific and technological developments. Students gain opportunities to engage with, and deeply examine the impact of scientific development on their lives from a critical and informed perspective. This helps to develop students' analytical and problem solving capacities, as well as their ability to make informed choices in their everyday lives.

As they plan and implement STSE education lessons, teachers need to provide a balanced view of the issues being explored. This enables students to formulate their own thoughts, independently explore other opinions and have the confidence to voice their personal viewpoints. Teachers also need to cultivate safe, non-judgmental classroom environments, and must also be careful not to impose their own values and beliefs on students.

[[File:waldkindergarten.jpg|200px|right]]

'''Knowledge &amp; understanding:''' The interdisciplinary nature of STSE education requires teachers to research and gather information from a variety of sources. At the same time, teachers need to develop a sound understanding of issues from various disciplines—philosophy, history, geography, social studies, politics, economics, environment and science. This is so that students’ knowledge base can be appropriately scaffolded to enable them to effectively engage in discussions, debates and decision-making processes.

This ideal raises difficulties. Most science teachers are specialized in a particular field of science. Lack of time and resources may affect how deeply teachers and students can examine issues from multiple perspectives. Nevertheless, a multi-disciplinary approach to science education enables students to gain a more rounded perspective on the dilemmas, as well as the opportunities, that science presents in our daily lives.

'''Pedagogic approach:''' Depending on teacher experience and comfort levels, a variety of [[pedagogic]] approaches based on [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] can be used to stimulate STSE education in the classroom. As illustrated in the table below, the pedagogies used in STSE classrooms need to take students through different levels of understanding to develop their abilities and confidence to critically examine issues and take responsible action.

Teachers are often faced with the challenge of transforming classroom practices from task-oriented approaches to those which focus on developing students' understanding and transferring agency for learning to students (Hughes, 2000). The table below is a compilation of pedagogic approaches for STSE education described in the literature (e.g. Hodson, 1998; Pedretti &amp; Forbes 2000; Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001):

==Projects in the field of STSE==

===Science and the City===

STSE education draws on holistic ways of knowing, learning, and interacting with science. A recent movement in science education has bridged science and technology education with society and environment awareness through critical explorations of place. The project Science and the City, for example, took place during the school years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 involving  an intergenerational group of researchers: 36 elementary students (grades 6, 7 &amp; 8) working with their teachers, 6 university-based researchers, parents and community members. The goal was to come together, learn science and technology together, and use this knowledge to provide meaningful experiences that make a difference to the lives of friends, families, communities and environments that surround the school. The collective experience allowed students, teachers and learners to foster imagination, responsibility, collaboration, learning and action. The project has led to a series of publications:

*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., &amp; Ibrahim, S. 2008. Visual journeys in critical place based science education. In Y-J. Lee, &amp; A-K. Tan (Eds.), Science education at the nexus of theory and practice. Rotterdam: SensePublishers 291-303.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., &amp; Ibrahim, S. 2007. Searching for Science Motive: Community, Imagery and Agency. Alberta Science Education Journal (Special Edition, Shapiro, B. (Ed.) Research and writing in science education of interest to those new in the profession). 38(2), 17-24.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Science and the City: A Field Zine'''

One collective publication, authored by the students, teachers and researchers together is that of a community zine that offered a format to share possibilities afforded by participatory practices that connect schools with local-knowledges, people and places.

*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., Ibrahim, S., &amp;  Blimkie, M. (Eds.) (2008) Science and the city: A Field Zine. Toronto: Ontario.
[An independent publication written by students and researchers and distributed free to research, student and parent communities].&lt;/small&gt;

===STEPWISE===

'STEPWISE' is the acronym for 'Science and Technology Education Promoting Wellbeing for Individuals, Societies and Environments.' It is a research and development project based on the STEPWISE framework, which integrates major categories of learning outcomes - including STSE - and relates all of them to 'WISE Activism.' In WISE Activism, students use their literacy in science and technology to try to bring about improvements to the 'wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments' (WISE). Students might, for example, use their knowledge about nutrition and issues relating to for-profit food manufacturing, along with data from their own inquiries into eating habits of students in a school cafeteria, to lobby the school administration to improve the nutritional value of foods on offer in the school.

The STEPWISE framework implements some important educational principles, including:
* Educate all students to the best of their ability;
* Address relationships among different learning domains (e.g., Skills and NoST Education);
* Encourage student self-determination (e.g., via student-led science inquiry &amp;/or technology design projects);
* Provide students with an apprenticeship that enables them to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in addressing important personal, social and environmental problems;
* Educate students about negative, as well as positive, aspects of the nature of science and technology and relationships between them and societies and environments; and,
* Encourage and enable students to take actions to address socioscientific issues; which implies that they use their literacy in science and technology (re: elements of STEPWISE) for improving the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments.

An important research goal/finding is that:
* educators should help students to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in the context of WISE Problems [http://www.lbencze.ca/WISE_Problems.html] (i.e., problems regarding the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments);
* doing the above may encourage and enable students to conduct science inquiry and/or technology design projects that explore possible WISE Problems;
* findings from students' WISE-oriented projects may serve as great motivation for addressing WISE Problems; more so than from STSE Education, since student-led science inquiry and/or technology design projects provide students with personal engagement in 'phenomena &lt;----&gt; representation' dialectical relationships.

You can learn more about STEPWISE, including how to get involved in it, at: [http://www.stepwiser.ca].

A forum for discussing STSE (socioscientific) issues and actions is at: [http://www.wepaste.org]. This forum contains a 'community-reviewed' journal; that is, the Journal for Activist Science &amp; Technology Education.

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone STSE education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—STSE coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, so students are not paid for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

==Science in India==

{{Main|Science and technology in India}}

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Scientism''' is an [[ideology]] that promotes [[science]] as the purportedly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] means by which society should determine [[normative]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] values. The term ''scientism'' is generally used critically, pointing to the cosmetic application of science in unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the [[scientific method]] or similar scientific standards.  

In [[philosophy of science]], the term ''scientism'' frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rey | first= Abel | title = Review of ''La Philosophie Moderne'' | journal = The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods |volume = 6.2 |date = 1909 | pages = 51–3 | doi= 10.2307/2011609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Abraham | last = Maslow | quote = There are criticisms of orthodox, 19th Century scientism and I intend to continue with this enterprise | title = Toward a Psychology of Being | chapter = Preface | edition = 1st|year=1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by social scientists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayek | title = The Counter Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason | publisher = Liberty Fund | date = June 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers of science such as [[Karl Popper]],&lt;ref name = Popper-Hacohen&gt;{{cite book |last = Hacohen|first = Malachi Haim| title = Karl Popper: the formative years, 1902–1945: politics and philosophy in interwar Vienna | date = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name= Putnam&gt;{{cite book| last= Putnam| first= Hilary | title = Renewing Philosophy |date= 1992|publisher= Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tzvetan Todorov]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov, Tzvetan]]. ''The Imperfect Garden: the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 20. "Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does."&lt;/ref&gt; to describe (for example) the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methodology and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22&gt;{{Citation | last = Outhwaite | first = William | origyear = 1988 | title = Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers | publisher = Polity Press | edition = 2nd | date = 2009 | page = 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, scientism is often interpreted as science applied "in excess". The term ''scientism'' has two senses:

# The improper usage of [[science]] or scientific claims.{{Sfn | Peterson | 2003 | p = 753 | ps =: 'the best way to understand the charge of scientism is as a kind of logical fallacy involving improper usage of science or scientific claims'}}  This usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = Denver | url = http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html | title = Scientism | first = Martin | last = Ryder | publisher = University of Colorado | accessdate = July 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630205732/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|deadurl=yes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and in contexts where there is insufficient [[empirical evidence]] to justify a scientific conclusion. It includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific. This can be a [[counterargument]] to [[argument from authority|appeals to scientific authority]]. It can also address the attempt to apply "hard science" methodology and claims of certainty to the [[social science]]s, which Friedrich Hayek described in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' (1952) as being impossible, because that methodology involves attempting to eliminate the "human factor", while social sciences (including his own field of [[economics]]) center almost purely on [[praxeology|human action]].

W. Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-34411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also sometimes used to describe universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that [[empirical science]] constitutes the most authoritative [[worldview]] or the most valuable part of human learning—to the complete exclusion of other viewpoints, such as historical, philosophical, economic or cultural worldviews. It has been defined as "the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society".&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley (Eds), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper Collins, 1999, p.775&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''scientism'' is also used by historians, philosophers, and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive [[reductionism]] in all fields of human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Collins | title = A Critical Analysis of Competency-based Systems in Adult Education | journal = Adult Education Quarterly | date = March 20, 1983 | volume = 33 | number = 3 | pages = 174–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Irwin | last = Chargaff | title = In Dispraise of Reductionism | journal = BioScience | volume = 47 | number = 11 |date= Dec 1997 | pages = 795–7 | doi= 10.2307/1313101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R Keith | last = Sawyer | title = Connecting Culture, Psychology and Biology: Essay Review on Inghilleri's From Subjective Experience to Cultural Change | journal = Human Development | volume = 43 | date =  2000 | pages = 56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Republic"&gt;{{cite web|last= Wieseltier|first= Leon|title= Crimes Against Humanities|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/114548/leon-wieseltier-responds-steven-pinkers-scientism|accessdate= 21 December 2013|date=4 September 2013|quote= His essay, a defense of "scientism," is a long exercise in assimilating humanistic inquiries into scientific ones.

For [[social theorist]]s in the tradition of [[Max Weber]], such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]], the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of [[positivism]], but also to the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] for modern [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunkhorst|first= Hauke|title= On Max Horkheimer: New Perspectives|date= 1995|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 0262522071|pages= 74|editor= Seyla Benhabib|editor2= Wolfgang Bonss|editor3= John McCole|chapter= Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British novelist [[Sara Maitland]] has called scientism a "myth as pernicious as any sort of [[fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

# It is used to criticize a totalizing view of science as if it were capable of describing ''all'' [[reality]] and [[knowledge]], or as if it were the ''only'' true way to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things;
# It is used, often pejoratively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term scientism is ordinarily used with pejorative intent. | first = Donald R | last = Peterson | title = Science, Scientism, and Professional Responsibility | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 196–210 |date=June 2004 | doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The term 'scientism' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense | first = C | last = Hakfoort | title = Science deified: Wilhelm Osstwald's energeticist world-view and the history of scientism | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | date = 1992 | pages = 525–44 | doi=10.1080/00033799200200441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Scientism... a term of abuse since [[Friedrich Hayek]] first popularized it in the 1940s. | first = Robert C | last = Bannister | title = Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1940 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | date = 1991 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  to denote a border-crossing violation in which the theories and methods of one (scientific) discipline are inappropriately applied to another (scientific or non-scientific) discipline and its domain. An example of this second usage is to label as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values (a traditional domain of [[ethics]]) or as the source of [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and purpose (a traditional domain of [[religion]] and related [[worldviews]]).

The term ''scientism'' was popularized by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winner [[F.A. Hayek]], who defined it as the "slavish imitation of the method and language of Science".&lt;ref name="Hayek1942"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayek |first=F.

[[Mikael Stenmark]] proposes the expression ''scientific expansionism'' as a synonym of scientism.&lt;ref name="expansionism"&gt;{{Citation | first = Mikael | last = Stenmark | contribution = Scientism | editor-first = J Wentzel Vrede | editor-last = van Huyssteen | title = Encyclopedia of science and religion | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Gale | date = 2003 | page = 783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of science and religion'', he writes that, while the [[doctrine]]s that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition, they share the idea that the boundaries of science (that is, typically the natural sciences) could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science (usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension).&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt;

According to Stenmark, the strongest form of scientism states that science has no boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor, with due time, will be dealt with and solved by science alone.&lt;ref name ="expansionism"/&gt; This idea has also been called the [[Myth of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = G | last1 = Monastra | first2 = MM | last2 = Zarandi | title = Science and the Myth of Progress | date = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. F. Schumacher]], in his ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted, measured and weighed. "The architects of the modern worldview, notably [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]], assumed that those things that could be weighed, measured, and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified. If it couldn't be counted, in other words, it didn't count."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.schumachersociety.org/publications/orr_92.html | first = David | last = Orr | contribution = Environmental Literacy: Education as if the Earth Mattered | title = Twelfth Annual EF Schumacher Lectures |date=October 1992 | place = Great Barrington, [[Massachusetts|MA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual historian [[T.J. Jackson Lears]] argues there has been a recent reemergence of "nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified 'science' has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies."

Genetic biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote in conservative journal ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'' that scientism has much in common with superstition: "the stubborn insistence that something...has powers which no evidence supports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Austin| last = Hughes| title = The Folly of Scientism | journal = The New Atlantis | date = Fall 2012 | volume = 37 | pages = 32–50 | url = https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-folly-of-scientism | access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to debates about science and religion==
Several scholars use the term to describe the work of vocal critics of religion-as-such. Individuals associated with [[New Atheism]] have garnered this label from both religious and non-religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Marilynne | title = Hysterical Scientism: The Ecstasy of Richard Dawkins | newspaper = Harper's Magazine |date=Nov 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stephen LeDrew on his 'The Evolution of Atheism' an Interview | url = http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5325 |date= 10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[John Haught]] argues that [[Daniel Dennett]] and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of [[scientific naturalism]], which holds the central dogma that "only nature, including humans and our creations, is real: that God does not exist; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haught argues that this belief system is self-refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Philosopher Peter Williams argues that it is only by conflating science with scientism that new atheists feel qualified to "pontificate on metaphysical issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Peter S.|title=C.S. Lewis vs. the New Atheists|date=2013|publisher=Paternoster|page=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] responded to religious criticism of his book ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'' by saying that accusations of scientism "[are] an all-purpose, wild-card smear... When someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don't like, they just try to discredit it as 'scientism'. But when it comes to [[facts]], and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | first = Sholto | last = Byrnes | title = When it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 10 April 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131703/http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | archive-date = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious scholars have also linked New Atheist thought with scientism. Atheist philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] conflates all empirical knowledge with that of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=He says that the discovery of moral truth depends on science, but this turns out to be misleading, because he includes under "science" all empirical knowledge of what the world is like...Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] argues that [[Christopher Hitchens]] possesses an "old-fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence" that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] has also criticized New Atheist philosopher [[Alexander Rosenberg]]'s ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality'' for resurrecting a self-refuting [[epistemology]] of [[logical positivism]] and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|title=True Believers|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=June 2012|quote=The main tenets of this philosophy are bracingly summed up in a series of questions and answers: Is there a God? No. What is the nature of reality? What physics says it is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], draws a parallel between scientism and traditional religious movements, pointing to the [[cult of personality]] that develops around some scientists in the public eye. He defines scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations, eschews [[supernatural]] and [[paranormal]] speculations, and embraces empiricism and [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shermer | first = Michael | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AA74F-FF5F-1CDB-B4A8809EC588EEDF | title = The Shamans of Scientism | journal = [[Scientific American]] |date=June 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian scholar [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] has stated that in the [[Western world]], many will accept the [[ideology]] of modern science, not as "simple ordinary science", but as a replacement for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chittick | first = William | title = The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington | date = 2007 | isbn = 1-933316-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory R. Peterson writes that "for many theologians and philosophers, scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins".&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"/&gt;

==Philosophy of science==
{{main article|Philosophy of science}}
In his essay ''Against Method'', [[Paul Feyerabend]] characterizes science as "an essentially anarchic enterprise"{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = vii | ps =: '[[Imre Lakatos]] loved to embarrass serious opponents with jokes and irony and so I, too, occasionally wrote in a rather ironical vein. An example is the end of Chapter 1: 'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history'}} and argues emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly over "dealing in knowledge" and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self-defined tradition. He depicts the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination, aimed at "making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more 'objective' and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules."{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii, 9, 11]}}

{{quotation|[S]cience can stand on its own feet and does not need any help from [[rationalist]]s, [[secular humanist]]s, [[Marxist]]s and similar religious movements; and... non-scientific cultures, procedures and assumptions can also stand on their own feet and should be allowed to do so... Science must be protected from ideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be protected from science... In a democracy scientific institutions, research programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected to public control, there must be a separation of state and science just as there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and science should be taught as one view among many and not as the one and only road to truth and reality.|Feyerabend|''Against Method''|p. viii{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii]}}}}

==Rhetoric of science==
{{main article|Rhetoric of science}}
Thomas M. Lessl argues that religious themes persist in what he calls scientism, the [[public rhetoric]] of science.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"/&gt; There are two methodologies that illustrate this idea of scientism. One is the epistemological approach, the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing and the ontological approach, that the rational mind reflects the world and both operate in knowable ways. According to Lessl, the ontological approach is an attempt to "resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism". Lessl also argues that without scientism, there would not be a scientific culture.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessl|first=Thomas M.|title=Naturalizing science: Two episodes in the evolution of a rhetoric of scientism|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=Fall 1996|volume=60|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.1080/10570319609374555}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3/5/2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and philosophy==
Philosopher of religion [[Keith Ward]] has said scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even [[self-refuting]], as the truth of the statements "no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)" or "no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true" cannot themselves be proven scientifically, logically, or empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Ward | author-link = Keith Ward | title = [[Is Religion Dangerous?]]|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William P |last=Alston |chapter=Religious language and verificationism |editor-first=Paul K |editor-last=Moser |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Copan |title= The Rationality of Theism |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-415-26332-8 |pages= 26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalization and modernity==
{{Main article|Rationalization (sociology)}}
In the introduction to his collected oeuvre on the [[sociology of religion]], [[Max Weber]] asks why "the scientific, the artistic, the political, or the economic development [elsewhere]… did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the Occident?" According to the distinguished German social theorist, [[Jürgen Habermas]], "For Weber, the intrinsic (that is, not merely [[contingent]]) relationship between [[modernity]] and what he called 'Occidental rationalism' was still self-evident." Weber described a process of rationalisation, [[disenchantment]] and the "disintegration of religious world views"  that resulted in modern [[secularisation|secular]] societies and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Habermas1990"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"Modernization" was introduced as a technical term only in the 1950s. It is the mark of a theoretical approach that takes up Weber's problem but elaborates it with the tools of social-scientific [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]… The theory of modernization performs two abstractions on Weber's concept of "modernity". It dissociates "modernity" from its modern European origins and stylizes it into a spatio-temporally neutral model for processes of social development in general. Furthermore, it breaks the internal connections between modernity and the historical context of Western [[rationalism]], so that processes of modernization… [are] no longer burdened with the idea of a completion of modernity, that is to say, of a goal state after which "[[postmodern]]" developments would have to set in.  …Indeed it is precisely modernization research that has contributed to the currency of the expression "postmodern" even among social scientists.||author=[[Jürgen Habermas]]|title=''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]''}}

Habermas is critical of pure [[instrumental rationality]], arguing that the "Social Life–World" is better suited to literary expression, the former being "intersubjectively accessible experiences" that can be generalized in a [[formal language]], while the latter "must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case":&lt;ref name="Olson2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Olson |date=2008 |title=Science and scientism in nineteenth-century Europe |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-07433-2 |lccn= 2007005146 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h8C7fe50J0AC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last = Habermas |first2=JJ |last2=Shapiro |date=1971 |title=Toward a rational society: student protest, science, and politics | format = paperback |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4177-2 |lccn= 73121827 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cW7PmVj7kzQC&amp;pg=PA50 |pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation |The world with which literature deals is the world in which human beings are born and live and finally die; the world in which they love and hate, in which they experience triumph and humiliation, hope and despair; the world of sufferings and enjoyments, of madness and common sense, of silliness, cunning and wisdom; the world of social pressures and individual impulses, of reason against passion, of instincts and conventions, of shared language and unsharable feelings and sensations…||author=[[Aldous Huxley]]|title=''[[Literature and Science]]''}}

==Epigraph==

The epigraph for chapter three is from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) by [[John Milton]], Book II, 681-683:

"Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,&lt;br /&gt;
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance&lt;br /&gt;
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way."

==Plot==

The novel opens amidst a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the [[Swiss Alps]] who seeks cover from the storm. He is a disillusioned outcast from society who seeks to kill himself. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life. Bandits attack them and take Wolfstein to an underground hideout. He meets Megalena, whom the bandits have abducted after killing her father in an ambush. After Steindolph, one of the bandits, recites a ballad about the reanimation of the corpse of a nun named Rosa, Wolfstein manages to poison the leader of the bandits, Cavigni, in a second attempt. He is able to escape with Megalena. Ginotti, a member of the bandits, befriends Wolfstein.

Wolfstein and Megalena flee to [[Genoa]] where they live together. Olympia, a woman of the town, seduces Wolfstein. Megalena, enraged by the relationship, demands that Wolfstein kill Olympia. Armed with a dagger, Wolfstein is unable to kill her. Olympia kills herself.

Ginotti follows Wolfstein. Ginotti is a member of the Rosicrucian, or Rose Cross, Order. He is an alchemist who seeks the secret of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=52rRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=wolfstein+percy+shelley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ks9Yibs3DT&amp;sig=k75B0HYJN9R9L5_JHw9-CoOMLkU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ySwXVKK8G5KcyASbxoHwCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wolfstein%20percy%20shelley&amp;f=false ''The Gothic Wanderer: From Transgression to Redemption'', "Rosicrucian Elements in ''Frankenstein''," p. 131.]&lt;/ref&gt; He tells Wolfstein that he will give him the secret to immortality if he will renounce his faith and join the sect.

Eloise de St. Irvyne is the sister of Wolfstein who lives in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Ginotti, under his new identity of Frederic Nempere, travels to Geneva and seeks to seduce her.

Ginotti reveals his experiments in his lifelong quest to find the secret of eternal life: "From my earliest youth, before it was quenched by complete
satiation, ''curiosity'', and a desire of unveiling the latent mysteries of nature, was the passion by which all the other emotions of my mind were intellectually organized. ... Natural philosophy at last became the peculiar science to which I directed my eager enquiries." He has studied science and the laws of nature to ascertain the mysteries of life and of being: "I thought of ''death''---... I cannot die.---'Will not this nature---will not the ''matter'' of which it is composed---exist to all eternity? Ah! I know it will; and, by the exertions of the energies with which nature has gifted me, well I know it shall.'" Ginotti tells Wolfstein that he will reveal the "secret of immortal life" to him if he will take certain prescribed ingredients and "mix them according to the directions which this book will communicate to you" and meet him in the abbey at St. Irvyne.

In the final scene, which takes place at the abbey of St. Irvyne in France, Wolfstein finds the corpse of Megalena in the vaults. An emaciated Ginotti confronts Wolfstein. Wolfstein is asked if he will deny his Creator. Wolfstein refuses to renounce his faith. Lightning strikes the vaults as thunder and a sulphurous windstorm blast the abbey. Both men are struck dead. This is the penalty they pay for "the delusion of the passions", for tampering with forces that they neither can control nor understand in seeking "endless life".

==Reception==
The novel, originally intended as a much longer "triple decker" novel, circulated as part of the "circulating libraries" which were popular at that time.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Behrendt, Stephen C. Edited by, with Introduction, and notes. Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne. Peterborough, ON, Canada: Broadview Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a source of revenue for the publisher of the novel. Shelley ended the novella abruptly, deciding not to develop or integrate the two strands. The result was a much shorter work.

Critics attacked the novel, which received generally negative reviews. The conservative British periodical ''The [[Anti-Jacobin Review]] and Magazine'', in a January 1812 review, castigated "the writer, who can outrage nature and common sense in almost every page of his book". The reviewer sought to deter readers from "the perusal of unprofitable and vicious productions."

French author Maurice Sarfati adapted the novel as ''Wolfstein et Mégaléna, ou La Vengeance du Rosiccrucien'', or ''Wolfstein and Megalena, the Vengeance of the Rosicrucian'', in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb40898072h BnF Catalogue General.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Wolfstein'' Chapbooks==

[[File:Wolfstein title page 1822.jpg|thumb|''Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit'', chapbook, title page, London, John Bailey, 1822.]]The novel was popular enough, however, to be made into two [[chapbook|chapbooks]] in 1822 and 1850. The first chapbook version was entitled ''[[Wolfstein (Percy Bysshe Shelley chapbook)|Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit]]'' and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822 after the original novel was republished that year.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein.html?id=JRoBHQAACAAJ ''Wolfstein; Or, The Mysterious Bandit.''

London: Grafton, 1939, p. 266. Block gives a publication date of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapbook version was a condensed version of the novella in 28 pages meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.

The story is described on the title page as "A Terrific Romance" with an epigraph by [[Ossian]]: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Added to ''Wolfstein'' was the story ''The Bronze Statue, A Pathetic Tale'' by another author, [[Anna Jane Vardill]].&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; "The Bronze Statue" had appeared for the first time in print as part of the "Annals of Public Justice" in ''The European Magazine'' of May, 1820, signed "V", i.e., Anna Jane Vardill.

Another more condensed twelve page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled ''[[Wolfstein, The Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave]]'': A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue. The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was "Two-Pence".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein_the_Murderer_Or_The_Secrets_of.html?id=OZhmngEACAAJ ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; Or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">"'''The Limits of Individual Plasticity'''" is a short essay written by [[science fiction]] author [[H.G. Wells]] (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) in 1895. In it, H.G. Wells speculates his theories
on the plasticity of animals, explaining that the default biological form of an animal may be altered in a way that it would continue to survive even if it, in any way, no longer resembles its inherent form. This could, according to Wells, theoretically be achieved through surgical, or [[chemical modification]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothma, Sheila and David, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-gB7ZawIDsC&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw The Pursuit of Perfection: The Promise and Perils of Medical Enhancement], Random House Digital, Inc., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was fully aware that surgical modification is only a physical change, and would not alter an animal's [[DNA|genetic blueprint]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Herbert George (1975). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ8eByH9QXsC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA H.G. Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction]. California: University of California Press. p. 249. {{ISBN|0520026799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He made note that should an animal be surgically 
modified, their offspring would most likely retain their parent creature's original physical form.

== Incorporation in novels ==

H.G. Wells presented many of his ideas from "The Limits of Individual Plasticity" in his 1896 science fiction novel, ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiler, Everett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&amp;pg=PA796&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg Science Fiction: The Early Years]. p.796. Kent State University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
In the novel, a shipwrecked Englishman named Edward Prendick is rescued from the sea and brought to a secluded island by a man named
Montgomery, who reveals the island is owned and operated by an eminent British physiologist named Dr. Moreau. Moreau was shunned from the scientific community
when his horrific experiments of [[vivisection]] were brought to the public spotlight. Dr. Moreau continued his experiments on vivisection
on his private island, where animals are altered with great detail to resemble human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, Nancy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObOBRDdBIEcC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22The+Limits+of+Individual+Plasticity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HB-HUfXSC8LhrAGsooDoCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw Promoting and Producing Evil], Rodopi, 2010, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; They are a defective experiment, as they will
revert to their bestial forms after a period of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7922">'''University spin-offs''' transform technological [[invention]]s developed from [[university]] [[research]] that are likely to remain unexploited otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Shane (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, university/academic spin-offs are a [[subcategory]] of [[research spin-off]]s. Prominent examples of university spin-offs are [[Genentech]], [[Crucell]], [[Lycos]] and [[Plastic Logic]]. In most countries, universities can claim the [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights on technologies developed in their [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. In the United States, the [[Bayh–Dole Act]] permits universities to pursue ownership of inventions made by researchers at their institutions using funding from the federal government, where previously federal research funding contracts and grants obligated inventors (wherever they worked) to assign the resulting IP to the government. This IP typically draws on [[patents]] or, in exceptional cases, [[copyrights]]. Therefore, the process of establishing the spin-off as a new [[Incorporation (business)|corporation]] involves transferring the IP to the new corporation or giving the latter a [[license]] on this IP. Most [[research universities]] now have [[Technology Licensing Office]]s (TLOs) to facilitate and pursue such opportunities.

== Critical steps in developing a spin-off ==

University spin-offs typically go through a number of critical steps to develop the initial invention into a successful business venture. The following steps are critical in creating a successful spin-off (not necessarily in this order).&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Vohora et al. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Developing a [[proof of concept]], or [[proof of principle]], that demonstrates that the invented method or new [[theory]] is probably useful in a particular application - for example a new [[product (business)|product]].
* Developing a fully functioning [[prototype]] of this new product; the prototype also serves to learn about how to produce, use and sell the new product.
* Attracting startup funding to finance the development of prototypes and new products; this may involve acquiring financial resources from [[venture capital]] firms, [[angel Investors]], [[bank]]s, or other providers of early-stage [[financial capital]].
* Developing a successful [[business model]] for the spin-off; a business model depicts the rationale of how the spin-off will create, deliver and capture value.
* Acquiring the first [[customers]]. The first customer, also called an [[early adopter]], can provide candid feedback to help the spin-off refine future product releases and also provide access to a [[distribution channel]] or other forms of support.

== Conditions for spin-off creation ==

Some universities generate substantially higher numbers of spin-offs than others.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio &amp; Shane (2003); Klofsten &amp; Jones-Evans (2000); Kondo (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Universities with high numbers of successful spin-offs …
* draw on university-wide [[awareness]] of entrepreneurial [[wiktionary:opportunity|opportunities]] and/or benefit from a strong entrepreneurship culture at the national or regional level;
* have developed a university culture that thrives on entrepreneurial [[role model]]s among their [[alumni]] and academic staff as well as successful spin-offs that serve as inspiring examples (e.g. [[Lycos]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]);
* actively stimulate the development of entrepreneurial talent and help founders of spin-offs obtain access to [[investors]], [[consultants]] and other forms of support; these activities are particularly critical in (e.g. continental European) countries that suffer from an entrepreneurial culture that is weaker than elsewhere (e.g. USA).&lt;ref&gt;Clarysse et al. (2005); Van Burg et al. (2008); Wright et al. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other issues ==

University spin-off activity may give rise to potential [[conflict of interest]] between commercial and academic work. In addition, the university’s [[reputation]] may be at risk if founders of spin-offs act inappropriately.&lt;ref&gt;Bird et al. (1993); Shane (2004); Slaughter &amp; Rhoades (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the antagonism between academic research and technology commercialization by way of spin-offs is likely to create fairness issues, for example regarding the distribution of [[royalties]] or [[equity (finance)|equity]]. This antagonism can be managed by installing [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] procedures for the spin-off formation process that enhance fair [[wiktionary:treatment|treatment]] of all participants.&lt;ref&gt;Van Burg et al. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
