The '''aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]''' included both a humanitarian crisis and massive economic impacts. The [[tsunami]] created over 300,000 refugees in the [[Tōhoku region]] of [[Japan]], and resulted in shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine and fuel for survivors. 15,891 deaths have been confirmed. In response to the crisis, the Japanese government mobilized the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defence Forces]], while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the [[Japanese Red Cross]] reporting $1 billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¥10 trillion ($122 billion).

A further serious impact of the tsunami  was the critical damage done to the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], resulting in [[Fukushima I nuclear incidents|severe releases of radioactivity]] and the prospect of a long-term health and [[environmental hazard]] in need of an expensive cleanup.

==Humanitarian crisis==
[[File:Temporary housings for tsunami evacuees in Shichigahama.jpg|thumb|Emergency housing under construction in Shichigahama]]

The [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] caused a large number of displaced people. The number of evacuees, as of 26 January 2012, was 341,411.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "11 March death toll updated to 15,848", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 February 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some earthquake survivors died in shelters or in the process of evacuation. Many shelters struggled to feed evacuees and were not sufficiently equipped medically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0317/TKY201103170134.html |title=asahi.com（朝日新聞社）：避難所など震災関連死２７人 医療設備不足や寒さ響く – 社会 |work=Asahi Shimbun |location=Japan |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331005043/http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0317/TKY201103170134.html| archivedate= 31 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fujimura |first=Naoko |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-26/japan-s-evacuees-battle-flu-survive-on-rice-balls-and-bread.html |title=Quake Evacuees Survive on Rice Balls, Bread, Seek to Avoid Contracting Flu |publisher=Bloomberg |date= 26 March 2011|accessdate=29 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331005142/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-26/japan-s-evacuees-battle-flu-survive-on-rice-balls-and-bread.html| archivedate= 31 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel shortages hampered relief actions. In the first week after the earthquake, supplies of food, water, and medicine were held up due to a fuel shortage and weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83d55156-509a-11e0-9e89-00144feab49a.html#axzz1I363qFis / Asia-Pacific – Fuel shortages hamper humanitarian effort].

There is a need for temporary housing, as the Japanese government are trying to remove evacuees from large shelters, where there have been reports of poor sanitary conditions. As of late March, 8,800 temporary units were planned in Iwate, 10,000 in Miyagi, and 19,000 in Fukushima.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimura, Naoko.

Bloomberg. Retrieved on 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 2011, the number of evacuees in Japan stood at 87,063.  Of those, 12,905 were residing in public shelters and 19,918 were staying in inns or hotels.  46,081 units of temporary housing, about 88 percent of the number planned, had been erected.  Evacuees had moved into 73 percent of the temporary housing available.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110811x1.html 87,000 still in limbo five months after quake]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 August 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear accidents==

Following the earthquake, tsunami, and failure of cooling systems at [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|issues concerning other nuclear facilities]] in Japan on 11 March 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan, and 140,000 residents within {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} of the plant were evacuated.&lt;ref name="bi-emergency"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|title=Japan Declares Nuclear Emergency, As Cooling System Fails At Power Plant|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fukushima-nuclear-plant-2011-3|accessdate=11 March 2011|newspaper=Business Insider|date=11 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110311152117/http://www.businessinsider.com/fukushima-nuclear-plant-2011-3| archivedate= 11 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explosions and a fire have resulted in dangerous levels of [[radiation]], sparking a stock market collapse and panic-buying in supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1500862/Blasts-escalate-Japan's-nuclear-crisis |title=Blasts escalate Japan's nuclear crisis |date=16 March 2011 |work=World News Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407005125/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1500862/Blasts-escalate-Japan%27s-nuclear-crisis |archivedate=7 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, France and some other countries advised their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading nuclear contamination. The accidents have drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. As of April 2011, water is still being poured into the damaged reactors to cool melting fuel rods. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it "might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/01/3179487.htm |title=Crews 'facing 100-year battle' at Fukushima |author=David Mark, Mark Willacy |date=1 April 2011 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima I plant have hardened attitudes to [[nuclear power]]. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are [[anti-nuclear]] and distrust government information on [[radiation]]".&lt;ref name=refuse2011/&gt; The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission – now required by law – to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name=refuse2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0620/Beginning-of-the-end-for-nuclear-power-in-Japan |title=Beginning of the end for nuclear power in Japan? |author=Gavin Blair, |date=20 June 2011  |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern Tōhoku region, which was most affected, accounts for about 8% of the country's gross domestic product, with factories that manufacture products such as cars and beer, as well as energy infrastructure.&lt;ref name="bloombergspendingplan" /&gt; It includes northern Miyagi prefecture, where Sendai is, about {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Tokyo. The Miyagi area includes manufacturing and industrial zones with chemical and electronics plants.

An estimated 23,600 hectares of farmland, mostly rice paddies, were damaged by the tsunami. Salt left in the soil by the seawater could adversely affect rice crops for years. The affected area accounts for as much as 3%–4% of Japan's rice production.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Alex, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110408f2.html Farmers struggle amid tsunami aftermath]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 April 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 4.37 million chickens in northeast Japan died following the earthquake as a result of disruptions in the supply of feed from overseas suppliers.&lt;ref name="Metropolis 2012, p. 4"&gt;''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', "The Small Print", 16–29 March 2012, No. 938, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 90% of the 29,000 fishing boats in Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures were rendered unusable by the tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110428a5.html 90% of Tohoku's fishing fleet said lost]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 April 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Miyagi Prefecture's fishing industry was almost completely destroyed. Twelve thousand of 13,000 registered fishing boats in the prefecture were destroyed or damaged. At least 440 fishermen were killed or missing. The damage to the prefecture's fishing industry was estimated at ¥400 billion (US$5 billion).&lt;ref&gt;Robson, Seth, and Elena Sugiyama, "[http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/earthquake-disaster-in-japan/miyagi-prefecture-fishing-industry-devastated-by-tsunami-1.141489 Miyagi prefecture fishing industry devastated by tsunami]", ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', 20 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The total damage to Japan's fishing industry, in seven affected prefectures, was estimated at ¥1.26 trillion (US$11.29 billion).&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, Setsuko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120307f1.html Fisheries rebound at sporadic pace]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 March 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earthquake and tsunami have had significant immediate impacts on businesses such as [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]] and [[Honda]], which completely suspended auto production until 14 March  2011. [[Nippon Steel Corporation]] also suspended production, [[Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company]] and [[Sumitomo Rubber Industries]] shuttered their tire and rubber production lines, while [[GS Yuasa]] closed its [[automotive battery]] production. This was expected to hinder supply availability for automakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/business/news/20110313p2g00m0bu012000c.html |title=Toyota, other automakers to suspend production at all domestic plants |date=13 March 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily News |accessdate=13 March 2011 |location=Tokyo |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x9RsDbNC?url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/business/news/20110313p2g00m0bu012000c.html |archivedate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economic analysts consider that, ultimately, the catastrophe will improve Japan's economy, with increased job availability during restoration efforts. An analyst at [[JPMorgan Chase]], citing the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and the Southern California [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], noted that natural disasters "do eventually boost output." An analyst at [[Société Générale]] anticipated that Japan's economy will decline in March 2011 but will revive powerfully in subsequent months. After the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]], industrial output dropped 2.6%, but increased by 2.2% the next month and 1% the following month. Japan's economy then accelerated substantially through the next two years, at more than its former rate.&lt;ref name="economicrecovery" /&gt; Others are of the opinion that the catastrophe will harm the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/nbr/blog/2011/03/japan_tsunami_economy.html |title=Japan's Tsunami- The Broken Window Fallacy Returns &amp;#124; XChange – The NBR Blog &amp;#124; Nightly Business Report |publisher=PBS |accessdate=13 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110316002510/http://www.pbs.org/nbr/blog/2011/03/japan_tsunami_economy.html| archivedate= 16 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have argued that those who predict that the reconstruction effort could help Japan's economy have fallen prey to the [[broken window fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melloan |first=George |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704893604576200670789813058?mod=rss_opinion_main |title=''Japan and the Broken Window Fallacy'', George Melloan, March 15, 2011, Wall Street Journal |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= 15 March 2011|accessdate=15 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110315182606/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704893604576200670789813058.html?mod=rss_opinion_main| archivedate= 15 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March, an executive of Bank of Japan's [[Osaka]] branch said he expected "a big decline in production, [leading to] an adjustment in the economy initially with exports and inventories falling and imports rising...

Japanese media reported in 2012 that up to 25% of special funds allocated by the government for disaster recovery and relief were being used outside the disaster area on projects unrelated to the earthquake and tsunami.  The projects included ¥500 million (US$4 million) for road construction in Okinawa, ¥330 million (US$3 million) for repairs to [[National Olympic Stadium (Tokyo)|National Stadium]], ¥10.7 million (US$95 thousand) in subsidies for nuclear research, ¥30 million (US$269 thousand) for power shovels for prisons in Hokkaido and Saitama, and ¥2.3 billion (US$20 million) to combat the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]].

There was a notable lack of disorder immediately following the earthquake.

Some ten days after the quake, reports began to emerge of incidents of [[looting]] and theft in quake and tsunami-hit areas. By 20 March 2011, 250 thefts, with ¥4.9 million (US$43 thousand) in merchandise stolen from stores and ¥5.8 million (US$52 thousand) in cash, were reported to the Miyagi Prefectural Police. Witnesses reported thieves stealing cash and bank books from smashed houses, looting goods from stores, and siphoning gas from abandoned or damaged vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]] and [[Jiji Press]], "Desperation tests crime taboo", ''Japan Times'', 21 March 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Thieves, looters targeting Miyagi's quake-hit stores", ''Japan Times'', 21 March 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-in/8395153/Japan-earthquake-Looting-reported-by-desperate-survivors.html |title=Japan earthquake: Looting reported by desperate survivors |last=Allen |first=Nick |date=21 March 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xMHawuzX?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-in/8395153/Japan-earthquake-Looting-reported-by-desperate-survivors.html |archivedate=21 March 2011 |location=London |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around ¥40 million (US$358 thousand) was reportedly stolen from a bank in Kesennuma, Miyagi.&lt;ref&gt;Gilhooly, Rob, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110327x1.html Survivors strive to start picking up the pieces]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27 March 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 11 March and the end of June 2011, a total of ¥684.4 million (US$6 million) was stolen from ATMs and convenience stores in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate prefectures. Of the money stolen, ¥477 million (US$4 million) from 34 ATM thefts took place in Fukushima Prefecture, 80% of that in the 20-km evacuation zone around the Daiichi nuclear plant. The number of thefts from homes and stores during the same period in those three prefectures stood at 1,233, about 1.5 times the number from the same period in 2010. Of them, 194 were in the nuclear evacuation zone, 19 times the number from 2010. The rumors which had spread immediately after the quake of rampant rapes by armed gangs proved to be false, as reports of sexual assaults actually fell 35.7 percent to 81 cases. Only one sexual assault was reported occurring in one of the evacuee centers. Throughout Japan, there were 51 reported cases of scams or frauds related to the disaster, with losses amounting to around ¥12.6 million (US$112 thousand).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]]/[[Kyodo News]], "¥684 million (US$6 million) stolen from ATMs in hardest-hit prefectures", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 July 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are no regulations imposed by the Japan government for conservation, many people practised self-restraint by conserving resources and cancelling celebrations, this reaction was attributed by experts as a way of coping with the traumatising scale of losses and the spreading fear of radioactive fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/151147/in-wake-tragedy-japanese-usher.html |title=Japanese usher in era of self-restraint |newspaper=Deccan Herald |date=29 March 2011 |publisher=The New York Times |page=A6 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2011, there were 2,439 complaints lodged with the [[National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan]] concerning earthquake-related scams from throughout Japan. A total of ¥970 million had been paid or lost by those targeted by the alleged scams. The reported scams included exorbitant house and roof repairs, faulty radiation gauges, and water filters touted to remove radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111226a5.html Scams targeting disaster victims]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 26 December 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government raised the [[International Nuclear Event Scale|level 7]] severity of the nuclear accident after the [[Japanese unified regional elections, 2011]].

Non-government organizations, including [[Peace Boat]], have assisted in cleaning up the disaster area since the quake.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Andrew, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110508x1.html A volunteer's journal of hope for Tohoku]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 8 May 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-citizen residents of Japan===
Approximately 531,000 non-Japanese residing in Japan departed the country after the quake and tsunami, including approximately 25% of foreigners living in Tokyo. Foreigners living in Japan and the English-language media in Japan coined the term "[[flyjin]]" (or fly-jin), a play on the Japanese word [[gaijin]], as a label for the non-Japanese who fled in the wake of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', "The Small Print: See Ya!", No. 893, 6–19 May 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gondor, Derek, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110405zg.html 'Fly-jin' face fallout from decision to go]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Debito Arudou|Arudou, Debito]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110503ad.html Better to be branded a 'flyjin' than a man of the 'sheeple']", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gurumurthy, R., "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/rc20110410a1.html Bad habit of judging foreigners]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 April 2011; ''[[Japan Times]]'', "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20120506a2.html 'Flyjin' rather few]", 6 May 2012, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of foreign residents in Japan dropped by 55,000 in 2011, with Iwate losing 15.5%, Fukushima 15.1%, and Miyagi 13.2% of their populations of non-Japanese. The total reduction in foreigners nationwide was 2.6% of the pre-quake total.&lt;ref name="Metropolis 2012, p. 4"/&gt;

===Media===

The former Japanese participant of [[Korean Broadcasting System]]'s ''[[Global Talk Show]]'' Junko Sagawa criticized the Japanese government for "intentionally ignoring the Japanese citizens during the tsunami and the nuclear crisis" through her personal homepage on 17 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ko:'미수다' 준코, 日 정부 공개 비난 "위험없다는 말은 더 이상 듣고 싶지 않아" | date = 19 March 2011 | url = http://bntnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&amp;nid=04&amp;c1=04&amp;c2=04&amp;c3=00&amp;nkey=201103191224503&amp;mode=sub_view | work = bntnews (Hankyung.com) | accessdate =31 August 2011 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earthquake postponed the [[analog shutdown]] in the Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures. Television stations in these three prefectures shut off their analog signals on 31 March 2012 at noon. Television stations in the Yamagata, Aomori, and Akita prefectures shut down their analog signals on 24 July 2011, along with the rest of Japan.

The '''''Annales Petaviani''''' (''AP'') is one of the so-called "minor annals group", three related ''[[Reichsannalen]]'', year-by-year histories of the [[Carolingian empire]] composed in [[Middle Latin|Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;The others are the ''[[Annales sancti Amandi]]'', ''[[Annales laubacenses]]'', and ''[[Annales tiliani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after the former owner of the manuscript, the French Jesuit [[Denis Pétau]] (1583–1652), whose name, in Latin, is Dionysius Petavius. The standard [[critical edition]] of the ''Annales'' is that of [[Georg Pertz]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. 

The first entry in the ''Annales Petaviani'' is for the year 687 and records the [[Battle of Tertry]]. There is then a gap until 708, when the annals begin again and continue to 799 in chronological order. Those entries through to 771 were compiled from earlier annals, such as the ''Annales sancti Amandi'' and the ''[[Annales mosellani]]'', and do not comprise an independent source. Together with the ''Annales sancti Amandi'', the ''Annales Petaviani'' are the primary source of the entries for 741–88 in the ''[[Annales laurissenses maiores]]''. Both of these may have been based on an earlier exemplar originally compiled contemporaneously with events at the convent of [[Great St. Martin Church|Sankt Martin]] in [[Cologne]]. For the years 771–99 the ''Annales Petaviani'' are an independent and contemporary source.

They are the only source to date [[Charlemagne]]'s birth to 747. They are also the only source to name either of [[Carloman I]]'s two known sons, who fled to Italy with his widow in 771. The one born towards 770, whom [[Pope Stephen III]] offered to baptise himself, was named Pepin. Carloman's widow, Gisela, is also named in only one source: the ''[[Annales mettenses priores]]''. The ''Annales Petaviani'' also provide a unique explanation for the retirement of Carloman's uncle and namesake, [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel]], who entered the [[Abbey of Montecassino]] in 747, leaving power in the hands of his brother, [[Pepin the Short]]. The ''Annales'' claim that Carloman's conversion to the religious life came about because his conscience was unsettled by his defeat in [[Alemannia]], where he lost thousands of men: ''Karolomannus intravit Alamanniam ubi fertur quod multa hominum millia ceciderit. Unde compunctus regnum reliquit'' ("Carloman enterred Alemannia where it is said that many thousands of men died. In remorse he relinquished the kingdom"). The ''Annales'' also provide evidence of an [[Anglo-Saxon]] presence in [[Marseille]], the great seaport of [[Merovingian]] [[Francia|Gaul]], when they note under the year 790 the death of the son of Botto, an English ''negotiator'' in Marseille.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3010">The '''Aspurgiani''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀσπουργιανοί}} or {{lang|grc|Ἀσπουγγιτανοί}}) were an ancient people, a tribe of the [[Maeotae]] dwelling along east side of the [[Strait of Kerch]] along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. They seem to be identical with the "[[Asturicani]]" of [[Ptolemy]] (v. 9. § 7).

The Aspurgiani inhabited the region called [[Sindica]], between [[Phanagoria]] and [[Gorgippia]], among the Maeotae, [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Agri (Maeotae)|Agri]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Obidiaceni]], [[Sittaceni]] and [[Dosci]], among others. (Strab. xi. 2. 11). They were among the Maeotic tribes whom King [[Polemon I of Pontus]] and [[Bosporan kingdom|the Bosporus]], in the reign of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]], attempted to subdue; however, they took him prisoner and put him to death. (Strab. xi. p. 495, xii. p. 556; [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]] ''s. v.''; see Ritter's speculations on the name, in connection with the origin of the name of Asia, Vorhalle, pp. 296, foil.). 

Scholars often attribute artifacts found in the Bosporus and Gorgippia, which featured the [[Solar deity|Sun god]] or its symbols, to the Aspurgiani tribes, indicating their Iranian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intangible Spirits and Graven Images: The Iconography of Deities in the Pre-Islamic Iranian World|last=Shaked|first=Shaul|last2=Bhayro|first2=Siam|publisher=BRILL|year=2014|isbn=9789004281486|location=Leiden|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes were first mentioned in Strabo's works as the group who killed Polemo when he launched a treacherous attack.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scythians and Greeks: A Survey of Ancient History and Archaeology on the North Coast of the Euxine from the Danube to the Caucasus|last=Minns|first=Ellis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781108024877|location=Cambridge|pages=128, 594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FSRPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT329&amp;dq=Aspurgiani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB5NGi4NPeAhWBa7wKHSGMBG8Q6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Aspurgiani&amp;f=false|title=The Geography of Strabo : Volume II (Illustrated)|last=Strabo|date=2014-04-07|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781312078659|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Strabo|last=Dueck|first=Daniela|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781317445852|location=London|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account cited that these tribes were more of a political party or a military colony rather than a tribe, having been founded by a person called [[Tiberius Julius Aspurgus|Aspurgus]], who once was a king of the [[Bosporan Kingdom|Bosporan kingdom]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''chronology of Jesus''' aims to establish a [[timeline]] for the events of the life of [[Jesus]]. Scholars have correlated [[Jewish]] and [[Greco-Roman]] documents and astronomical calendars with the [[New Testament]] accounts to estimate dates for the major events in Jesus's life. 

Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]]: one based on the accounts in the [[Gospels]] of his birth with reference to [[Herod the Great|King Herod's]] reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=MJDG324 &gt;[[John P. Meier]] (1991).

Three details have been used to estimate the year when [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus began preaching]]: a mention of his age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" during "the fifteenth year" of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], another relating to the date of the building of the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], and yet another concerning the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 &gt;Eerdman Publishing.

Five methods have been used to estimate the date of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. One uses non-Christian sources such as [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. |author2=[[Jesus Seminar]]  |authorlink=Robert W.

Both methods result in AD&amp;nbsp;36 as an upper bound to the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum. (2009).

Humphreys &amp; W. G. Waddington. (1985). The Date of the Crucifixion. ''Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation'',&amp;nbsp;''37''. (March 1985). [http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[lunar eclipse]] method, the Apostle Peter's statement that the moon turned to blood at the crucifixion ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14-21]]) is taken to refer to the lunar eclipse of 3 April AD 33; although astronomers are discussing whether the eclipse was visible as far west as Jerusalem.  Recent astronomical research uses the contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus' last Passover on the one hand with John's date of the subsequent "Jewish Passover" on the other hand, to propose Jesus' Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday 3 April AD 33.

(1999). ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'', pages=6–7, 105–10, 232–34, 266. [[Alfred A. Knopf]] Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; One indication that the gospels are theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one-third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, also known as [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} page 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the gospels provide some details regarding events which can be clearly dated, so one can establish date ranges regarding major events in Jesus' life by comparison with independent sources.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name = autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Historical  Figure of Jesus | last = Sanders | first = EP | publisher = Penguin Books | place = London | year = 1995 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and [[Greco-Roman]] sources, have been used in historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus.&lt;ref name= Blomberg431 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pages 431-436&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all modern historians agree that Jesus existed, and regard [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]] as historical events, and assume that approximate ranges for these events can be estimated.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285&gt;In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" B.

Using these methods, most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=

===Biblical references to King Herod's reign===
The two [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity accounts of Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke]] differ substantially from each other, and are considered to have been written independently. However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Luz]]: ''Die Geburtsgeschichten Jesu und die Geschichte.'' Göttingen 2013, [https://books.google.de/books?id=6ZJbAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 S. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jesus was born under the Judean king [[Herod the Great]] (Matt 2,1f; Luke 1,5 vs Luke 2,1f)
*in [[Bethlehem]] (Matt 2,5f; Luke 2,4.15)
*prior to his parents moving to [[Nazareth]] (Matt 2,22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39).
*Jesus' parents [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] were [[Engagement#Betrothal|betrothed]] (Matt 1,18–20; Luke 1,27; 2,5).
* His birth was a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* [[Angel]]s announced Jesus' birth, his name, his role as the [[Messiah]] (being a descendant of King [[David]] and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|son of God]]), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matt 1,21; Luke 1,77; 2,11,30).

Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus' birth with the reign of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matt 2:16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although some have argued for 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

===Subtracting Jesus' age of "about 30 years" when preaching===
Another approach to estimating Jesus' year of birth is based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" when starting his ministry.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate to have been in AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 28–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
The Gospel of John 8:57 mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus' age when preaching: ''Then the Jews said to Him: You are not even fifty years old, and you claim to have seen Abraham?'' Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus's claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=Humphreys72 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the [[heliacal rising]] and lunar [[occultation]] of [[Jupiter]], while it was [[Apparent retrograde motion#Apparent motion|momentarily stationary]] in the [[Aries (constellation)|constellation of Aries]]. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea. &lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar, "The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi," Rutgers University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a "comet" that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC.  Authors Dugard and O'Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem. &lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Bill, and Dugard, Martin, "Killing Jesus: A History," Henry Holt and Company, 2013, {{ISBN|0805098542}}, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''101 Questions and Answers on the Bible'', Paulist Press (2003), page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years of preaching==

===Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke===
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Madaba Map]] showing [[Bethabara]] (Βέθαβαρά), calling it the place where John baptised]]
One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the [[ministry of Jesus]] is based on the Gospel of Luke's specific statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1-2]] about the ministry of [[John the Baptist]] which preceded that of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans67 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]] began on the death of his predecessor [[Augustus Caesar]] in September AD&amp;nbsp;14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD&amp;nbsp;28 or early AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Cradle &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, Charles L Quarles, ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown'' (B&amp;H Publishing, 2009), page 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=art201 &gt;''Luke 1-5: New Testament Commentary'' by John MacArthur 2009 {{ISBN|0-8024-0871-0}} page 201&lt;/ref&gt; Riesner's alternative suggestion is that John the Baptist began his ministry in AD&amp;nbsp;26 or 27, because Tiberius ruled together with Augustus for two years before becoming the sole ruler. If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius' reign would be counted from AD&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref name="Riesner"/&gt; Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule - namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio - count from AD&amp;nbsp;14 - the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref name=Humphreys64 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament presents [[John the Baptist]] as the precursor to Jesus and the [[Baptism of Jesus]] as marking the beginning of Jesus' ministry.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} page 224-229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alister16 &gt;''Christianity: an introduction'' by Alister E.

Rausch 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5078-3}} page&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' baptism account is followed directly by his [[Temptation of Christ|40 day fast and ordeal]].

===The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John===
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Herod's Temple]], referred to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]], as imagined in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]]. It is currently situated adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]

Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the [[Synoptic gospels]] is to relate the account in the [[Gospel of John]] about the visit of Jesus to [[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] says that Jesus went to the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] around the start of his ministry and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] Jesus is told: "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?".&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;

Herod's Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the [[Temple Mount]], which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.&lt;ref name=Roller67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundquist /&gt;&lt;ref name= Maxxix &gt;''The biblical engineer: how the temple in Jerusalem was built'' by Max Schwartz 2002 {{ISBN|0-88125-710-9}} pages xixx-xx&lt;/ref&gt; Having built entire cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]], Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument.&lt;ref name=Lundquist &gt;''The Temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future'' by John M. Lundquist 2007 {{ISBN|0-275-98339-0}} pages101-103 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22john+2:20%22+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kpydTvvXB-qK4gSg2NHPCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%202%3A20%22%20temple&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of [[Augustus]] to Syria.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roller67 &gt;''The building program of Herod the Great'' by Duane W. Roller 1998 University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-20934-6}} pages 67-71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZsB1yQOmyEC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=herod+temple+construction&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DredTu3cIqT64QSitp2nCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20construction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus]] ([[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Ant 15.11.1]]) states that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostenberger140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the historical Jesus'' by Craig A. Evans 2008 {{ISBN|0-415-97569-7}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod's reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt; Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

===Josephus' reference to John the Baptist===
Both the gospels and first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]], in his work [[Antiquities of the Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;''The new complete works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus'', William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Herod Antipas]] killing [[John the Baptist]], and to the marriage of Herod and [[Herodias]], establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt; Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]]), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2]].&lt;ref name=Leslie508 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} pages 508-509 [https://books.google.com/books?id=17kzgBusXZIC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=baptist+josephus+antipas+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5kmbTvPYB9TP4QSuzIDjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptist%20herodias%20josephus%20antipas%20jesus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women in scripture'' by [[Carol Meyers]], Toni Craven and Ross Shepard Kraemer 2001 {{ISBN|0-8028-4962-8}} pages 92-93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbHT73BxpAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=herodias+herod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJmcToy0M4abOtTmzIYJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Herod Antipas in Galilee: The Literary and Archaeological Sources'' by Morten H.

The exact year of the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] and [[Herodias]] is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; While some scholars place the year of the marriage in the range AD&amp;nbsp;27-31, others have approximated a date as late as AD&amp;nbsp;35, although such a late date has much less support.&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt; In his analysis of Herod's life, [[Harold Hoehner]] estimates that John the Baptist's imprisonment probably occurred around AD&amp;nbsp;30-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oO0upEG0g7kC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=herodias+herod+antipas#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod%20antipas&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;Herod Antipas'&amp;#39; by Harold W.

===Reign of Herod Antipas===
{{see also|Jesus at Herod's court}}
In the [[Gospel of Luke]], while Jesus is in [[Pilate's court]], Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean and thus is under the jurisdiction of [[Herod Antipas]].&lt;ref name=Niswonger &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L.

This episode is described only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:7|23:7–15]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} page 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patella &gt;''The Gospel according to Luke'' by Michael Patella 2005 {{ISBN|0-8146-2862-1}} page 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: The Gospel of Amazement'' by Michael Card 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-8308-3835-6}} page 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudyworkshop.com/data/Lesson228.pdf |title=Bible Study Workshop - Lesson 228 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars have questioned the authenticity of this episode, given that it is unique to the Gospel of Luke, the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia states that it fits well with the theme of the gospel.&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;

===Conversion of Paul===
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], Greece, where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered early in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;]]
Another approach to estimating an [[upper bound]] for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]] which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt; Paul's conversion is discussed in both the [[Letters of Paul]] and in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey William (1979). ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A–D'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. pp. 689. {{ISBN|0-8028-3781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|15:3–8]]), Paul refers to his conversion. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#9|Acts 9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#22|Acts 22]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#26|Acts 26]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and His Letters'' by John B. Polhill 1999 {{ISBN|0-8054-1097-X}} pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' by William Lane Craig, James Porter Moreland 2009 {{ISBN|1-4051-7657-1}} page 616&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the year of Paul's conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before [[Junius Annaeus Gallio|Junius Gallio]] in [[Achaea]] Greece ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:12|Acts 18:12–17]]) around AD&amp;nbsp;51–52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the [[Delphi Inscription]]s, at [[Delphi]] across the Gulf from [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name=Marrow45 &gt;''Paul: his letters and his theology'' by Stanley B.

Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of [[Seneca the Younger]]) became [[proconsul]] between the spring of AD&amp;nbsp;51 and the summer of AD&amp;nbsp;52, and that his position ended no later than AD&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 &gt;''The Cambridge Companion to St Paul'' by James D.

Evans 2004 {{ISBN|0-7814-4006-8}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Paul is generally assumed to be in the earlier part of Gallio's tenure, based on the reference ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|Acts 18:2]]) to his meeting in Corinth with [[Priscilla and Aquila]], who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius' [[Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome|expulsion of Jews from Rome]], which is dated to AD&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;ref name=Novak18 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edition'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Testament, Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth, approximately seventeen years after his conversion.&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdsman1019 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' Amsterdam University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 1019&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1-10]] states that Paul went [[Paul the apostle#Visits to Jerusalem in Acts and the epistles|back to Jerusalem]] fourteen years after his conversion, and various missions (at times with [[Barnabas]]) such as those in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#11:25|Acts 11:25–26]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Corinthians#11:23|2 Corinthians 11:23–33]] appear in the Book of Acts.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt; The generally accepted scholarly estimate for the date of conversion of Paul is AD&amp;nbsp;33–36, placing the death of Jesus before this date range.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt;

===Astronomical analysis===

====Newton's method====
[[File:Bolton-newton.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton]]]]
All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (Matt 27:62, 28:1, Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, John 19:31,42). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April in our calendar). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (Leviticus 23 v. 5; Numbers 28 v. 16). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover (John 18 v. 28 and 19 v. 14), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan ("sacrificed as a Passover lamb", 1 Cor 5:7), and was resurrected on the Jewish [[Shavuot|festival of the first fruits]], i.e. on a 16 Nisan (1 Cor 15:20).&lt;ref name=Humphreys68 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html "The Date of the Crucifixion"], Colin Humphreys and W. Graeme Waddington, March 1985. American Scientific Affiliation website. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, [[Isaac Newton]] considered only the range AD&amp;nbsp;31–36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, and 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton &gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733).

K. Fotheringham]], who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"&gt;Fotheringham, J.K., 1910.

Schaefer]] and J. P. Pratt, following a similar method, arrived at the same date.&lt;ref name=Pratt1 &gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J. P. |year=1991 |title=Newton's Date for the Crucifixion |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=301–304 |bibcode=1991QJRAS..32..301P }} [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991QJRAS..32..301P]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=B.

A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.&lt;ref&gt;C. Philipp E. Nothaft, ''Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology'' (200–1600) page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' (Penguin, 1993) 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD&amp;nbsp;27.  Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;ref name=Humphreys53 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD&amp;nbsp;27 and AD&amp;nbsp;34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with Luke 3:1–2, and spring AD&amp;nbsp;34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD&amp;nbsp;30, and Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.&lt;ref name=Humphreys63 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipse method====
[[File:Total_lunar_eclipse_May_4_2004-Jpeter_smith.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Lunar eclipse]], 4 May 2004. Red hue caused by diffraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.]]
A [[lunar eclipse]] is potentially alluded to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]] ("The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come"), as pointed out by physicist [[Colin Humphreys]] and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33,&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"/&gt;[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/0001-0100/LE0033-04-03P.gif] a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red "bite" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]]).&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Astronomer [[Bradley Schaefer]] agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1990, March). Lunar visibility and the crucifixion. Royal Astronomical Society Quarterly Journal, 31(1), 53–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1991, July). Glare and celestial visibility.

A potentially related issue involves the reference in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος – the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,&lt;ref&gt;David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing,  1999) page 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a [[solar eclipse]], since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover,&lt;ref name=Milone &gt;''Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy'' by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011 {{ISBN|1-4419-7623-X}} pages 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond'' by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 {{ISBN|0-495-56203-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.&lt;ref&gt;Meeus, J. (2003, December). ''The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse''. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, astronomers [[Colin Humphreys|Humphreys]] and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the ''lunar'' eclipse of AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref name="HumWadJASA"/&gt; This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'.&lt;ref name="henige"&gt;{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | authorlink=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | page=150| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a ''[[khamsin]]'', i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review&lt;ref name="Telford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371–376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the "three different Passovers in John" and Matthew's statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate's alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys 2011 p85 "Much apocryphal writing consists of highly theatrical literature, which cannot be used as historical evidence ... if [Pilate's report to Tertullian] is a Christian forgery, probably made up on the basis of Acts, as seems likely, then this suggests there was a tradition that at the crucifixion the moon appeared like blood."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double Passover method====
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|The rising full moon at sunset signals the start of the Passover meal. This is two weeks after the new moon has heralded the start of the month of Nisan (March/April).]]
In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) ''before'' his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official "Jewish" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall ''after'' Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' "synoptic" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's "Jewish" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by [[Moses]] in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the [[Samaritans]]). The official "Jewish" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD&amp;nbsp;30 and AD&amp;nbsp;33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD&amp;nbsp;30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD&amp;nbsp;33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 192–195&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel's Holy Week "is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction".  As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;WR Telford ''The Barren Temple and the Withered Tree: A Redaction-Critical Analysis of the Cursing of the Fig-Tree Pericope in Mark's Gospel and its Relation to the Cleansing of the Temple Tradition'' Bloomsbury, London, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; "the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions."

===Scholarly debate on time of death===
[[File:Papyrus 90 (John 19.1-7).jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Papyrus 90]] fragment of [[Gospel of John|John 19]]]]
The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries, since there was perceived to be&lt;ref name=RBrown959 /&gt; a clear difference between the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels and that in the Gospel of John. Also, some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), ''Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus – A Critical Study'' [Trans. from German] (pp. 35–71 for ‘The Chronology of “More Than One Day”)&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Kellum142 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nis167 &gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Niswonger+%22which+meant+Friday%22&amp;btnG= ''New Testament History''] by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pages 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the [[Last Supper]] takes place on the first night of [[Passover]], defined in the [[Torah]] as occurring after daylight on [[Quartodeciman|14 of Nisan]], and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Lev|23:5–6|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[the Gospel of John]] the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett, ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'', page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999). {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm and eaten before midnight on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Philo]] |title=''De Specialibus Legibus'' 2.145 |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]]. ''[[s:The War of the Jews|The War of the Jews]]'' [[s:The War of the Jews/Book VI#Chapter 9|6.9.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishnah]], [[Pesahim]]'' 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding fits well with [[Old Testament]] [[Typology (theology)|typology]], in which Jesus entered [[Jerusalem]] to identify himself as the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal lamb]] on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, at the same time the High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the [[First Fruits]]. It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:17–19}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:12–16}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts,&lt;ref name= KEasley323 /&gt; although [[Raymond E.

Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 538&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]] has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the [[Lamb of God]].&lt;ref name="Barclay2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Barclay|title=The Gospel of John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTjS1ADrbMkC&amp;pg=PA340|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-015-1|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Humphreys' widely publicised "double passover" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the hour of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the "six days" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie Jaubert&lt;ref&gt;La date de la cène, Gabalda, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran ''solar'' calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper ''after'' the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of [[Samaritans]] did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s.

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which "does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise."&lt;ref name="Telford"/&gt;

==Ancient estimates==
Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries, e.g. [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and [[Cassiodorus]] asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD&amp;nbsp;31.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 3rd/4th century Roman historian [[Lactantius]] states that Jesus was crucified on a particular day in AD&amp;nbsp;29, but that did not correspond to a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Of the Manner In Which the Persecutors Died'' 2: "In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius (''sic'') Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, as I find it written".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="969">The '''Compromise of Avranches''' in 1172 marked the reconciliation of [[Henry II of England]] with the Catholic Church after the [[Becket controversy]] from 1163, which culminated with the murder in 1170 of [[Thomas Becket]].&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Warren, ''Henry II'' (2000), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Henry was purged of any guilt in Becket's murder, and swore to go on crusade. He agreed to allow appeals to the papacy in Rome, and to eliminate all customs to which the Church objected. He also agreed that the secular courts had no jurisdiction over the clergy, with the exceptions of high treason, highway robbery and arson: the [[Benefit of Clergy]] provision in English law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In return, the king managed to secure good relations with the papacy at a time when he faced rebellions from his sons.

{{confused|alternate history}}

'''Counterfactual history''', also sometimes referred to as '''virtual history''', is a form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer "[[wikt:what if|what if]]" questions known as [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," ''American Historical Review'' (2004) 109#3 pp. 845–858 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Black and MacRaild provide this definition: "It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Donald M. MacRaild|title=Studying History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQZeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=125|isbn=9780230364929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a [[literary genre]] which is variously called [[alternate history|alternative history]], [[speculative fiction|speculative history]], or hypothetical history.&lt;ref name = "Arnold" /&gt;

One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim "What would have happened had [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] drunk [[coffee]] instead of [[tea]] on the afternoon he committed suicide?", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual "What would have happened had Hitler died in the [[20 July plot|July 1944 assassination attempt]]?", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to [[World War II]]. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, [[Albert Speer|Speer]], [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.

==Development==
Although there are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.

An early example is ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' (1931) which features a contribution by [[Winston Churchill]] who examined what would have happened had [[Robert E. Lee]] won at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg |first=Winston |last=Churchill |authorlink=Winston Churchill |publisher=The Churchill Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132718/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional [[alternate history]] genre.

A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]]. In his 1964 book ''[[Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History]]'', Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History – Book Reviews ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228010214/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”&lt;ref name="eh.net"/&gt;

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of ''[[Plausible Worlds|Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences]]'' by the Cambridge sociologist [[Geoffrey Hawthorn]], who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederic |last=Smoler |title=Past Tense |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/past-tense |journal=American Heritage |date=September 1999 |volume=50 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work helped inspire ''[[Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals]]'' (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian [[Niall Ferguson]]. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as [[Marxism]], and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of [[What If? (essays)|"What If?"]] books edited by [[Robert Cowley]] presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about "how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time."&lt;ref name = "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/books/making-books-the-what-ifs-that-fascinate.html?src=pm|title=Making books: The 'What Ifs' that fascinate|last=Arnold|first=Martin|date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven [[globalization]] processes for almost a thousand years. From [[Song dynasty]] in China to [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither [[historical revisionism]] nor [[alternate history]].

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], whose alternate-history novel ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as "a useless exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/riceandsalt.htm|title=Kim Stanley Robinson: The Years of Rice and Salt – an infinity plus review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about [[causality]] in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's ''Virtual History in History and Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00090 |title=Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency |journal=History and Theory |volume=38 |number=2 |pages=264–276 |date=May 1999 |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1171466/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-83415-5 |doi=10.2277/0521834155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Richard J. Evans]] in his book ''Altered Pasts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/altered-pasts-counterfactuals-in-history-by-richard-j-evans/2012202.article|title=Altered Pasts: Counterfactuals in History, by Richard J.

[[File:Kyrgyz Manaschi, Karakol.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kyrgyz ''[[Epic of Manas|manaschi]]'' performing part of the epic poem (dastan) at a yurt camp in [[Karakol]]]]
'''Dastan''' ({{lang-fa|داستان}} ''dâstân'', meaning "story" or "tale")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steingass|first=Francis Joseph|authorlink=Francis Joseph Steingass|title=A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, Including the Arabic Words and Phrases to Be Met with in Persian Literature|place=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

A dastan is generally centered on one individual who protects his tribe or his people from an outside invader or enemy, although only occasionally can this figure be traced back to a historical person. This main character sets an example of how one should act, and the dastan becomes a teaching tool — for example the [[Sufi]] master and Turkic poet [[Khoja Akhmet Yassawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] said "Let the scholars hear my wisdom, treating my words like a dastan".{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}} Alongside the wisdom, each dastan is rich with cultural history of interest to scholars.

During the [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian invasion and occupation of Central Asia]], many new dastans were created to protest the Russian occupation. It is possible that they came into contact and influenced each other. According to Turkish historian [[Hasan Bülent Paksoy]], the [[Bolsheviks]] tried to destroy these symbols of culture, e.g. by only publishing them in insufficiently large quantities and in a distorted form "in order to weaken the heroic impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paksoy|first=H.B.|authorlink=Hasan Bülent Paksoy|chapter-url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-6/cae05.html|chapter=Dastan Genre in Central Asia|title=Essays on Central Asia|year=1999|place=Lawrence|publisher=Carrie|pages=82|OCLC=45603165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable dastan is ''[[Book of Dede Korkut|Korkut Ata]]'' of the [[Oghuz Turks]] — which may have been created as early as the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=Michael E.|title=The Dede Korkut Ethic|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=24|issue=3|date=August 1992|pages=395–417|doi=10.1017/S0020743800021954|quote=The ''Book of Dede Korkut'' is an early record of oral [[Turkish folklore|Turkic folktales]] in [[Anatolia]], and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among [[Turkic peoples]] living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to [[Geoffrey Lewis (scholar)|Lewis]] (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the [[Aq Qoyunlu|Akkoyunlu Confederation]] of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves “Turcoman” rather than “Oghuz,” had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun.

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995).

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty.

''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|-

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russia]]'s behavior threatens the integrity and existence of [[NATO]] member states and Russia's non-NATO neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=Russian expansionism may pose existential threat, says NATO general |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2015-02-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/russia-existential-threat-british-nato-general |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events associated with Russia are: the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and Russia's [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]]; the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], which began in 2014 with the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]]; and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|military intervention in Syria]].

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

This article details the history and status of '''Heritage conservation in [[Hong Kong]]''', as well as the role of various stakeholders.

An indication of the size of the built heritage in Hong Kong is given by a territory-wide survey conducted by the [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] (AMO) between 1996 and 2000, which recorded some 8,800 buildings. The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is also an emerging theme.

==Historic buildings==
[[File:HK CausewayBayTinHauTemple.JPG|thumb|The [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau Temple]] in Causeway Bay is a declared monument since 1982.]]
As of 20 May 2016, there were 114 [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monuments]] in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/DM_Mon_List_e.pdf List of declared monuments on LCSD website]&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013, there were 917 graded historic buildings (153 Grade I, 322 Grade II, 442 Grade III), of which 203 were owned by the Government and 714 by private bodies.&lt;ref name="Audit60"&gt;Report No. 60 of the Director of Audit, [http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e60ch01.pdf Chapter 1: "Conservation of monuments and historic buildings"], 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading system===
Grades for historic buildings are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-eng.pdf Results of the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I]]: "Buildings of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible."
* [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II]]: "Buildings of special merit; efforts should be made to selectively preserve."
* [[List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade III]]: "Buildings of some merit; preservation in some form would be desirable and alternative means could be considered if preservation is not practicable."

===Surveys and assessment===
[[File:King Yin Lei SingChiu.jpg|thumb|[[King Yin Lei]] was declared a monument in 2008 after media had reported that its owner had begun demolishing the building.]]
A territory-wide survey on historic buildings conducted by the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) between 1996 and 2000 recorded some 8,800 buildings. A more detailed survey conducted between 2002-2004 focused on 1,444 buildings.&lt;ref name="Completion"&gt;[http://www.devb-wb.gov.hk/press_releases_and_publications/UMPR/index.aspx?langno=1&amp;nodeid=1779&amp;Branch=W&amp;lstYear=2009&amp;PressReleaseID=11946 Press Release: "Completion of the assessment of 1,444 historic buildings announced". March 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005,&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; a seven-member Expert Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-A.pdf Composition of the Expert Panel for the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising historians and members of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Architects]], [[Hong Kong Institute of Planners]] and [[Hong Kong Institute of Engineers]] was formed by the Antiquities Advisory Board (AAB) to assess the heritage value of these buildings. The assessment was completed on March 19, 2009. As part of this work, the AMO proposed changes in the grading of historic buildings: 212 buildings to be Grade I, 366 to be Grade II, and 576 to be Grade III, and no grading for the remaining 290 ones.&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; Current grades may be increased, decreased or removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-E.pdf List of the Historic Buildings in Building Assessment (as of 18 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation initiatives==
[[File:1881 Heritage 200905.jpg|thumb|Adaptive reuse: the [[Former Marine Police Headquarters Compound]], a declared monument, is being transformed into a heritage hotel with food and beverage outlets, and retail facilities.]]
Conservation initiatives include:
* Heritage Impact Assessment Mechanism for Capital Works Projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB137-6-A-chi.pdf Heritage Impact Assessment Mechanism for Capital Works Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.gov.hk/en/rhbtp/about.htm Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Building restoration|Restoration]]
* [[Adaptive reuse]]
* Relocation: complete ([[Murray House]]) or partial ([[Blake Pier at Stanley]])

==Issues==

===Demolitions===
[[File:QP Hungerstrike.jpg|thumb|Public protest against the demolition of [[Queen's Pier]]: hunger strikers occupied the location in July 2007.]]
The demolition of several historic buildings has led to public protest in recent years. This included the [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier]] (demolition completed in early 2007) and [[Queen's Pier]], demolished in February 2008.

===Other issues===
Other issues include:
* Ownership of historic buildings and private owners' rights
* Funding of Heritage conservation programs

==Intangible cultural heritage==
The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is an emerging theme in Hong Kong, with The Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee having held its first meeting on July 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det2.php?id=190 Press release: "Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee holds first meeting". July 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A territory-wide survey was carried out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkheritage.ust.hk/english|title=Introduction {{!}} Territory-wide Survey of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Hong Kong|website=hkheritage.ust.hk|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4340">{{For|academic study of the Spanish (and sometimes Portuguese) cultures and language|Hispanism}}
'''Hispanismo''' or '''Hispanicism''' is an [[ideology]], [[school of thought]] and [[historiography|historiographic current]] centered on [[Spain|Spanish]] heritage. In [[Hispanic America]] it is similar but unlike most times to [[indigenismo]].&lt;ref name=Montoya1998&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montoya Iriarte |first=Urpi |date=1998 |title=Hispanismo e Indigenismo: o dualismo cultural no pensamento social peruano (1900-1930). Uma revisão necessária |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0034-77011998000100005 |journal=[[Revista de Antropologia]] |publisher= |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |access-date=30 January 2016 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of hispanismo holds that "countries" should not deny their cultural roots because in doing so they are denying themselves. In the case of [[Hispanic America]] these cultural roots are Spanish and indigenous. An important detail is that in hispanismo the Spanish roots are implicitly more important than the indigenous roots. Hispanismo consist of Hispanic American countries building upon their "own heritage" which would be the same as Spanish heritage.&lt;ref name=Gong&gt;{{cite book |last=Góngora |first=Alvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |date= |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |url= |language=Spanish |location= |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=224–225 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''Because of that the Spaniard is not yet another element in the ethnic conglomerate. He is the decisive factor, the only one that could attract them all... Because of this any attempt to forget the Spanish name in these lands and oppose to him a hyperbolic renewed value of the indigenous, would go straight to attack the lifeblood that unite our peoples. Anything worthy that the ancient civilizations could have had at the moment of decadence when they faced the Spanish conquest was saved and defended by the Spaniards themselves who took with them just in time the instrument of writing, unknown to the indigenous peoples, to perpetuate the history and the traditions of the conquered ones. Whatever the Spaniards destroyed was not comparable with what they contributed with in terms of culture.''| [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rojas Mix |first=Miguel |date=1991 |title=Los cien nombres de América: eso que descubrió Colón |url= |location= |publisher=Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica |page=186 |isbn=84-264-1209-2 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hispanistas==
The ranks of notable supporters of hispanismo include Chilean historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]], who rejected liberal historiography in favor of [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] hispanismo.&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;{{Cite journal| url   = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-656.html

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

'''Historical reenactment''' (or '''re-enactment''') is an [[educational entertainment|educational or entertainment]] activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of [[Pickett's Charge]] presented during the [[Great Reunion of 1913]], or as broad as an entire period, such as [[Regency reenactment]] or [[The 1920s Berlin Project]].

==History==
[[File:Corbould edward henry thejoustbetweenthelordofthetournament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|''The joust between the Lord of the Tournament and the Knight of the Red Rose'', a [[lithograph]] commemorating the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]]]]
Activities related to "reenactment" have a long history. The Romans staged recreations of famous battles within their [[Amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] as a form of public [[spectacle]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] often reenacted historical themes from [[Ancient Rome]] or elsewhere.

Military displays and mock battles and reenactments first became popular in 17th century England. In 1638 the first known reenactment was brought to life by Lord James ‘Jimmy’ Dunn of Coniston, a staged battle between Christian and Muslim forces was enacted in London, and the [[Roundheads]], flush from a series of victories during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], reenacted a recent battle at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in 1645, despite the ongoing conflict.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.eventplan.co.uk/page29.html| title=A Brief History of Re-enactment| author=Howard Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the nineteenth century that historical reenactments became widespread, reflecting the then intense [[Romantic movement|romantic]] interest in the [[medievalism|Middle Ages]]. Medieval culture was widely admired as an antidote to the modern [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and [[industrial age]]. Plays and theatrical works (such as ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', which in 1820 was playing in six different productions in [[London]] alone)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Anstruther|Anstruther, Ian]] ''The Knight and the Umbrella: An Account of the Eglinton Tournament, 1839''. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd, 1963. pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; perpetuated the romanticism of knights, castles, feasts and tournaments. The [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]] staged naval battles from the [[Napoleonic War]] on the large lake on his estate in 1821, and a reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] was put on for a public viewing at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] in 1824.&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

Historical reenactment came of age with the grand spectacle of the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]], a reenactment of a [[medieval]] [[jousting|joust]] and revel held in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="EglintonT"&gt;Corbould, Edward. ''The Eglinton Tournament: Dedicated to the Earl of Eglinton''. Pall Mall, England: Hodgson &amp; Graves, 1840.[http://www.georgeglazer.com/archives/prints/genre/eglingtonjoust.html]. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and organized by [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton]]. The Tournament was a deliberate act of [[Romanticism]], and drew 100,000 spectators.

[[File:A map of the Eglinton Tournament features.jpg|left|thumb|Layout of the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839|Eglinton Tournament]].]]
It was held on a meadow at a loop in the [[River Irvine|Lugton Water]]. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes rising on all sides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Anstruther|Anstruther, Ian]] ''The Knight and the Umbrella: An Account of the Eglinton Tournament, 1839''. London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd, 1963. pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Eglinton announced that the public would be welcome; he requested medieval fancy dress, if possible, and tickets were free. The pageant itself featured thirteen medieval knights on horseback.

The preparations, and the many works of art commissioned for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, had an effect on public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as a similar lavish tournament in Brussels in 1905, and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by  [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Ivanhoe]]'': it was attempting "to be a living reenactment of the literary romances".&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Karen, 2009, "The Eglinton Tournament of 1839"&lt;/ref&gt; In Eglinton’s own words "I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition&amp;nbsp;— more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; I am aware that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Literary Gazette, 1831:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reenactments of battles became more commonplace in the late 19th century, both in Britain, and also in America. Within a year of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], survivors of [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] reenacted the scene of their defeat for the camera as a series of still poses.

[[File:Battle of namur reenactment.jpg|thumb|right|Modern reenactments of historical battles were held at [[Aldershot#The Aldershot Military Tattoo|Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo]]. Pictured, the programme for the 1934 show, where the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Siege of Namur]] was recreated.]]
In 1895, members of the [[Royal Engineers|Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers]] reenacted their famous stand at [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]], 18 years earlier. 25 [[British Army|British soldiers]] beat back the attack of 75 [[Zulu people|Zulus]] at the Grand Military Fete at the [[Cheltenham|Cheltenham Winter Gardens]].&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

Veterans of the [[American Civil War]] recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "Reliving the Civil War: A reenactor's handbook". Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1999. p 4 "Civil War reenacting was done almost from the beginning of war, as soldiers demonstrated to family and friends their actions during the war, in camp, in drill, and in battle. Veterans organizations recreated camp life to show their children and others how they lived and to reproduce the camaraderie of shared experience with their fellow veterans."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Reunion of 1913]], celebrating the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], was attended by more than 50,000 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including [[Pickett's Charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/reunion13.htm |title=The Great Reunion of 1913 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |date=September 1998 |author=Heiser, John |publisher=[[National Park Service]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918074740/http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/getttour/sidebar/reunion13.htm| archivedate= 18 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in [[Russia]] with reenactments of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)]] (1906), the [[Battle of Borodino]] (1812) in [[St Petersburg]] and the ''Taking of Azov'' (1696) in [[Voronezh]] in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 ''[[Storming of the Winter Palace]]'' on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]''.

Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the [[Aldershot#The Aldershot Military Tattoo|Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo]] in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Siege of Namur]], an important military engagement of the [[Nine Years' War]], was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show.&lt;ref name="Giles"/&gt;

In America, modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961–1965 [[American Civil War Centennial|Civil War Centennial]] commemorations.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 4 "Without a doubt, Civil War reenactment got its boost during the centennial, which also saw the birth of the [[North-South Skirmish Association]] (N-SSA)."&lt;/ref&gt; After more than 6,000 reenactors participated in a 125th anniversary event near the original Manassas battlefield, reenacting grew in popularity during the late 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 6 "In 1986, the first of the 125th Anniversary battles was held near the original battlefield of [[First Bull Run|Manassas]]. More than anything, this mega-event sparked an interest in the Civil War and reenacting."&lt;/ref&gt; and there are today over a hundred Civil War reenactments held each year throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beery|first1=Zoë|title=Say Goodbye to Your Happy Plantation Narrative|url=https://theoutline.com/post/3956/cheyney-mcknight-not-your-mommas-history-profile|website=The Outline|accessdate=30 March 2018|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most participants are amateurs who pursue history as a [[hobby]]. Participants within this hobby are diverse, ranging in age from young children whose parents bring them along to events, to the elderly. In addition to hobbyists, members of the armed forces and professional historians sometimes participate.

===Categories of reenactors===
Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into several broadly defined categories, based on the level of concern for [[authenticity (reenactment)|authenticity]].&lt;ref name="Dress Authenticity"&gt;Strauss. "In the United States, hobby organizations participate in the public reenactment of historical events. The most popular is Civil War reenacting, which can be viewed as a manifestation of the unresolved nature of that war&amp;nbsp;... Among reenactors, the quest for historical authenticity is considered a core value."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton. p 34&lt;/ref&gt;  (It should be noted that these definitions and categorisation is primarily that of the USA.  Other countries have different terms of art, [[slang]], and definitions)

====Farbs====
{{main|Farb (reenactment)}}
"[[Farb (reenactment)|Farb]]s" or "polyester soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 209 and p 219&lt;/ref&gt; are reenactors who spend relatively little  time and/or money achieving authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or period behavior. Anachronistic clothing, fabrics, fasteners (such as [[velcro]]), [[Snood (headgear)|snoods]], [[footwear]], vehicles, and modern cigarettes are common.	
	
The origin of the word "farb" (and the derivative adjective "farby") is unknown, though it appears to date to early [[American Civil War]] centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8. "Ross M. Kimmel states that it was used at the Manassas reenactment in 1961&amp;nbsp;... George Gorman and his 2nd North Carolina picked up the term at the First Manassas Reenactment in 1961 and enjoyed using it constantly with condescension and sarcasm directed toward other units."&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the word derives from a truncated version of "Far be it from authentic".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://wesclark.com/jw/hodge.html |title=They Don Period's Clothes, Eat Era's Grub and Sneer At Less-Exacting Brethern |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=1994-06-02 |accessdate=2011-01-03 |last=Horwitz |first=Tony |quote=Some also refuse to fight beside those whose uniforms and performance art don't measure up: a group derided as "farbs," {{Sic|hide=y|short|-hand}} for "far-be-it-from-authentic."}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative definition is "Far Be it for me to question/criticise",&lt;ref name="Hadden 8"&gt;Hadden, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesclark.com/jw/forigin.html Wesclark.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Fast And Researchless Buying".&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8 ''Juanita Leisch calls it "Fast And Researchless Buying," and other sources insist it came from the Bicentennial and Revolutionary War groups and means "Fairly Authentic Royal British."''&lt;/ref&gt; A humorous definition of "farb" is "F.A.R.B: Forget About Research, Baby". Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German ''Farbe'', color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined.&lt;ref name="Hadden 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-far1.htm Worldwidewords.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burton K. Kummerow, a member of "The Black Hats, CSA" reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors since.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, pp.&amp;nbsp;219–220&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mainstream====
Mainstream reenactors make an effort to appear authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used "after hours" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
{{anchor|Progressive}}

====Progressive====
At the other extreme from farbs are "hard-core authentics", or "progressives," as they sometimes prefer to be called.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 138&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes derisively called "stitch counters",&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 224&lt;/ref&gt; "(t)he hard-core movement is often misunderstood and sometimes maligned."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, p 138 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate "reenactorisms". They generally seek an "immersive" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the period might have done. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p. 138 "Like soldiers of the Civil War, progressives experience the same poor conditions that the original soldiers did, camping without tents and sleeping out exposed to the cold and rain. They spend weekends eating bad and insufficient food, and they practice a steady regimen of work, marching, and drill. They suffer the cold, carrying insufficient clothing and blankets as well as sleeping campaign-style by spooning with each other for warmth."&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for an immersive experience often leads hard-core reenactors to smaller events, or to setting up separate camps at larger events.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period==
[[Image:Buckskins.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Mountain man]] reenactor displaying [[buckskins]]]]
The ''period'' of an event is the range of dates. See [[authenticity (reenactment)]] for a discussion of how the period affects the types of costume, weapons, and armour used.

Popular periods to reenact include:
* [[Classical reenactment]]
* [[Dark Ages reenactment]]
* [[Medieval reenactment]]
* [[Renaissance reenactment]] (including [[English Civil War reenactment]])
* [[Modern reenactment]]
**[[Regency reenactment]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Clothing and equipment==
[[Image:CompanyOfStGeorgeCamp2006.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Company of Saynt George|The Company of St. George]] recreating a small medieval military camp in France, 2006.]]
Numerous cottage industries abound that provide not only the materials but even the finished product for use by reenactors. Uniforms and clothing made of hand woven, natural dyed materials are sewn by hand or machine using the sartorial techniques of the period portrayed.

Detailed attention to authenticity in design and construction is given equally as well to headgear, footwear, eyewear, camp gear, accoutrements, military equipment, weapons and so on. These items (which are generally much more expensive than clothing and uniform in modern production) offer the wearer a lifelike experience in the use of materials, tailoring and manufacturing techniques that are as close to authentic as possible.

Event spectators may derive more satisfaction from attending reenactments when a high level of authenticity is attained in both individual clothing and equipment, as well as equipment used in camp.

===Living history===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0628-0006-001, Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer.jpg|thumb|Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer Leipzig 1970, the [[popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries|popular image of Native Americans]] made Indian living history quite popular in communist Eastern Germany]]
{{Main|Living history}}
The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a manner that in most cases is not following a planned script. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred. While the latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events.

Living histories are usually meant for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, The [[National Park Service]] land; NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are HIGHLY controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historial truths"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=25 July 2008 | publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals as e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity. The specific German approach of [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP/&gt; Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Benita Luckmann: Bretten, Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but serve as [[staffage]] for the immersion experience.&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark several [[open air museum]]s uses living history as a part of their concept. These include [[Middelaldercentret]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/themedievaltown.html The Medieval Town]. [[Middelaldercentret]]. Accessed 9 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Old Town, Aarhus]] and [[Frilandsmuseet]].

===Combat demonstration===
Combat demonstrations are mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public what combat in the period might have been like. Combat demonstrations are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may simply consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.

[[Image:Pike Charge Battle of Maidstone Military Odyssey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Maidstone]] Reenactment, [[Kent]] (2011)]]

===Battle reenactment===
Scripted battles are reenactments in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that were taken in the original battles.

They are often fought at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original. These demonstrations vary widely in size from a few hundred fighters to several thousand, as do the arenas used (getting the right balance can often make or break the spectacle for the public).

===Tactical combat===
{{Main|Tactical event}}
Tactical battles are generally not open to the public. Tactical battles are fought like real battles with both sides coming up with strategies and tactics to beat their opponents. With no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and on-site judges, tactical battles can be considered a form of [[Live action role-playing game]], but, in the cases where firearms are used, with real weapons firing blank ammunition (depending on gun control ordinances).

Tactical reenactment is one of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism activities | activities]] done by the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], which hosts tournaments using practice (not damaging) versions of medieval and renaissance weapons.

===Commercial reenactment===
{{See also|List of tourist attractions providing reenactment}}

Many castles, museums, and other historical tourist attractions employ actors or professional reenactors as part of the experience.  These usually address the recreation of a specific town, village, or activity within a certain time frame. Commercial reenactment shows are usually choreographed and follow a script.

Some locations have set up permanent [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] displays. By their nature, these are usually [[living history]] presentations, rather than tactical or battle reenactment, although some host larger temporary events.{{clear left}}

In 2008 [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]] and North Carolina's Tryon Palace staff and buildings provided the period backdrop for early 1800's life depicted in the "Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck" documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck" Documentary|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=nautilusproductions.com|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Many publications have covered historical reenactment and [[living history]]. Prominent among these are the ''Camp Chase Gazette'', ''Smoke and Fire News,'' and two different magazines named ''Living History'', and ''Skirmish Magazine''.

[[File:Preussische Soldaten exerzieren.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=260|left|Autumnal military exercise 1912 / Reenactment [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]], [[Konz]]]]

''The Medieval Soldier'' by [[Gerry Embleton]] and [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] (1995) is a popular book on the topic, which has been translated into French and German. It was followed by ''Medieval Military Costume in Colour Photographs''.

For the Napoleonic period, two books of interest cover life in the military at that time and living history: ''The Napoleonic Soldier'' by Stephen E. Maughan (1999) and ''Marching with Sharpe'' by B. J. Bluth (2001). Various Napoleonic reenactment groups cover the history of their associated regiments as well as try to describe and illustrate how they approach recreating the period. The goal to be as authentic as is possible has led many serious reenactment societies to set up their own research groups to verify their knowledge of the uniforms, drill and all aspects of the life that they strive to portray. In this way reenactment plays a vital role in bringing history to life, keeping history alive, and in expanding the knowledge and understanding of the period.

In the UK a number of small publishing houses have been established that particularly publish books about the English Civil War and more recently, of earlier periods as well. The largest are Stuart Press (with around 250 volumes in print) and Partizan Press.

Little has been published about reenactment in the mainstream market, except for press articles. One exception is the book ''I Believe in Yesterday: My Adventures in Living History'' by Tim Moore, which recounts his experiences trying out different periods of reenactment and the people he meets and things he learns whilst doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Tim (2008). ''I Believe in Yesterday: My Adventures in Living History''. London: Jonathan Cape. {{ISBN|0-224-07781-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media support==
Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'',&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-09/features/1993282122_1_ted-turner-gettysburg-jeff-daniels |last=Jubera |first=Drew |title=GETTYSBURG: Ted Turner, a cast of thousands and the ghosts of the past |date=1993-10-09 |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/events/natm/glory.aspx AFI Night at the Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and ''[[Alatriste]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics.

In a documentary about the making of the film ''Gettysburg'', actor [[Sam Elliott]], who portrayed Union General [[John Buford]] in the film, said of reenactors:

{{quote|text=I think we're really fortunate to have those people involved. In fact, they couldn't be making this picture without them; there's no question about that.  These guys come with their wardrobe, they come with their weaponry.  They come with all the accoutrements, but they also come with the stuff in their head and the stuff in their heart.&lt;ref&gt;This documentary can be found on the DVD of the film ''Gettysburg''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
[[Image:Wehrmacht re-enactors recreate the battle of Molotov Line in Sanok-Olchowce. (Poland) 2008. June 22.jpg|thumb|[[Wehrmacht]] reenactors recreate the battle of [[Molotov Line]] in [[Sanok]]-Olchowce.]]

Critics question the motivation of reenactors; some suggest concerns about the level of immersion found in some areas, notably those involving 20th century conflicts where combatants had stricter regulations regarding [[personal grooming]].&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jenny. ''Wargames: Inside the World of 20th Century Reenactors'' (Smithsonian Books, Washington, 2004). {{ISBN|1-58834-128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of reenactors is generally far higher than the average age of soldiers in most conflicts. Few reenactment units discriminate based on age and physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, reenactors are overwhelmingly white and thus African-American characters, both enslaved and free, are underrepresented. (Hundreds of thousands of black Union soldiers served in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Soldiers in the U.S. Military During the Civil War|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war|website=National Archives|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2013, five black reenactors at the 150th anniversary event at Gettysburg constituted "the largest bloc of black civilians anyone had ever seen at an event whose historical basis was full of black civilians...Astonished spectators stopped them constantly, usually assuming they were portraying enslaved people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beery|first1=Zoë|title=Say Goodbye to Your Happy Plantation Narrative|url=https://theoutline.com/post/3956/cheyney-mcknight-not-your-mommas-history-profile|website=The Outline|accessdate=30 March 2018|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's book discusses the "fantasy [[farb (reenactment)|farb]]", or tendency of reenactors to gravitate towards "elite" units such as commandos, paratroopers, or [[Waffen-SS]] units. This results in under-representation in the reenactment community of what were the most common types of military troops in the period being reenacted. The question has arisen among North American reenactors, but similar issues exist in Europe. For example, in Britain, a high proportion of Napoleonic War reenactors perform as members of the [[95th Rifles]] (perhaps due to the popularity of the fictional character of [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]]) and medieval groups have an over-proportion of plate-armoured soldiers.{{or|date=October 2016}} The UK has multi-period events such as "History in Action", where groups can see each other's appearance and performances, as well as perform for the general public. Weapons can be a concern in countries where weapons of most forms are legally banned or socially frowned on (such as in the UK).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

A final concern is that reenactors may be accused of being, or actually be, aligned with the political beliefs that some of the reenacted armies fought for, such as Nazism or the Confederate South. For example, U.S. politician [[Rich Iott]]{{'s}} participation in a [[World War II reenactment]] in which he was in the group that portrayed the German [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking]] side excited media criticism during his [[United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010#District 9|2010 Congressional campaign]].&lt;ref name="Nazi uniform row"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11511574 |title=US Republican candidate Rich Iott in Nazi uniform row |date=2010-10-10 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, in the weeks following [[Unite the Right rally|a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia]] at which a neo-Nazi killed a counterprotester, some reenactors complained about &amp;mdash; as one reporter put it &amp;mdash; "the co-opting of the [Civil] war by neo-Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Mark|title=Will Civil War reenactments die out?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/will-civil-war-reenactments-die-out/2017/08/25/f43c6bc0-874b-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html|accessdate=30 March 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and mechanisms of the '''Fall of the Western Roman Empire''' are a historical theme that was introduced by historian [[Edward Gibbon]] in his 1776 book ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. He started an ongoing [[historiography|historiographical]] discussion about what caused the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], and the reduced power of the remaining Eastern Empire, in the 4th–5th centuries. Gibbon was not the first to speculate on why the Empire collapsed, but he was the first to give a well-researched and well-referenced account.  Many theories of causality have been explored. In 1984, [[Alexander Demandt]] enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new theories emerged thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crookedtimber.org/2003/08/25/decline-and-fall | first=Alexander | last=Demandt | title= 210 Theories | work=[[Crooked Timber]] weblog entry | date=August 25, 2003 | accessdate=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html Alexander Demandt: 210 Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232650/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html |date=2015-03-16 }}, Source: A. Demandt, ''Der Fall Roms'' (1984) 695. See also: Karl Galinsky in ''Classical and Modern Interactions'' (1992) 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon himself explored ideas of internal decline (the disintegration of political, economic, military, and other social institutions, civil wars) and of [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. "From the eighteenth century onward," historian [[Glen Bowersock]] wrote, "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1996) 49#8 pp 29-43 at p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of historiography==
[[Historiography|Historiographically]], the primary issue historians have looked at when analyzing any theory is the continued existence of the Eastern Empire or Byzantine Empire, which lasted almost a thousand years after the fall of the West. For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards (although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success). As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not "fall."

Theories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon's criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing [[British Empire]]. In the 19th century [[socialism|socialist]] and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame [[decadence]] and other political problems. More recently, [[natural environment|environment]]al concerns have become popular, with [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]] proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to [[epidemic]]s such as early cases of bubonic plague and [[malaria]] also cited. Global [[climate changes of 535–536]], perhaps caused by the possible eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 535, as mentioned by [[David Keys (author)|David Keys]] and others,&lt;ref name="Krakatoa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winchester |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Winchester |title=[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883]] |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-621285-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another example. Ideas about transformation with no distinct fall mirror the rise of the [[postmodern]] tradition, which rejects [[periodization]] concepts (see [[metanarrative]]). What is not new are attempts to diagnose Rome's particular problems, with [[Satire X]], written by Juvenal in the early 2nd century at the height of Roman power, criticizing the peoples' obsession with "[[bread and circuses]]" and rulers seeking only to gratify these obsessions.

One of the primary reasons for the vast number of theories is the notable lack of surviving evidence from the 4th and 5th centuries. For example, there are so few records of an economic nature it is difficult to arrive at even a generalization of the economic conditions. Thus, historians must quickly depart from available evidence and comment based on how things ought to have worked, or based on evidence from previous and later periods, on [[inductive reasoning]]. As in any field where available evidence is sparse, the historian's ability to imagine the 4th and 5th centuries will play as important a part in shaping our understanding as the available evidence, and thus be open for endless interpretation.

The end of the Western Roman Empire traditionally has been seen by historians to mark the end of the [[Ancient Era]] and beginning of the Middle Ages. More recent schools of history, such as [[Late Antiquity]], offer a more nuanced view from the traditional historical narrative.

There is no consensus on a date for the start of the Decline. Gibbon started his account in 98.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The year 376 is taken as pivotal by many modern historians.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In that year there was an unmanageable influx of [[Goths]] and other [[Barbarians]] into the Balkan provinces, and the situation of the Western Empire generally worsened thereafter, with recoveries being incomplete and temporary. Significant events include the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the [[crossing of the Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the execution of [[Stilicho]] in 408, the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] in 410, the death of [[Constantius III]] in 421, the death of [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in 454, and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]] in 455, with the death of [[Majorian]] in 461 marking the end of the last opportunity for recovery.

Gibbon took September 4, 476 as a convenient marker for the [[final dissolution of the Western Roman Empire]], when [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]], a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of the year 476 for its end.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, echoing the trope of the sound a tree falling in the forest, titled an article in 1973, "La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C." ("The noiseless fall of an empire in 476 AD").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Nepos]], the Western emperor recognized by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], continued to rule in [[Dalmatia]], until he was assassinated in 480. The [[Ostrogoth]]ic rulers of [[Italia]] considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman tradition, and the Eastern emperors considered themselves the sole rightful Roman rulers of a united empire.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Roman cultural traditions continued throughout the territory of the Western Empire, and a recent school of interpretation argues that the great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, Volume A: To 1500|author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

==Overview of events==
{{See also|Late Antiquity|Migration Period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
[[File:RomulusAugustus.jpg|thumb|right|206px|[[Romulus Augustus]] was deposed as [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Emperor]] in 476 while still young. However, [[Julius Nepos]] continued to claim the title of Western Emperor after his deposition.]]

The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the traditional markers of the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Migration period]]. Although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for several centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests]]), the Empire as a whole had initiated major cultural and political transformations since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], with the shift towards a more openly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and ritualized form of government, the adoption of [[Christianity]] as the [[state religion]], and a general rejection of the traditions and values of Classical Antiquity. While traditional historiography emphasized this break with Antiquity by using the term "[[Byzantine Empire]]" instead of Roman Empire, recent schools of history offer a more nuanced view, seeing mostly continuity rather than a sharp break. The Empire of [[Late Antiquity]] already looked very different from [[Ancient Rome|classical Rome]].

The Roman Empire emerged from the [[Roman Republic]] when [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus Caesar]] transformed it from a republic into a monarchy. Rome reached its zenith in the 2nd century, then fortunes slowly declined (with many revivals and restorations along the way). The reasons for the decline of the Empire are still debated today, and are likely multiple. Historians infer that the population appears to have diminished in many provinces—especially western Europe—from the diminishing size of fortifications built to protect the cities from [[barbarian]] incursions from the 3rd century on. Some historians even have suggested that parts of the periphery were no longer inhabited because these fortifications were restricted to the center of the city only. Tree rings suggest "distinct drying" beginning in 250.&lt;ref name=treerings&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12186245 | title = Roman rise and fall 'recorded in trees' | last = Kinver | first = Mark |date = 14 January 2011 | work =[[BBC]] | accessdate = 24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 3rd century, the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] no longer served as an effective capital for the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and various cities were used as new administrative capitals. Successive emperors, starting with [[Constantine I|Constantine]], privileged the eastern city of [[Byzantium]], which he had entirely rebuilt after a siege. Later renamed [[Constantinople]], and protected by formidable walls in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, it was to become the largest and most powerful city of Christian [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the Empire was intermittently ruled by more than one emperor at once (usually two), presiding over different regions. At first a haphazard form of power sharing, this eventually settled on an East-West administrative division between the [[Western Roman Empire]] (centered on Rome, but now usually presided from other seats of power such as [[Trier]], [[Mediolanum|Milan]], and especially [[Ravenna]]), and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (with its capital initially in [[Nicomedia]], and later Constantinople). The [[Latin]]-speaking west, under dreadful demographic crisis, and the wealthier{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking east, also began to diverge politically and culturally. Although this was a gradual process, still incomplete when Italy came under the rule of barbarian chieftains in the last quarter of the 5th century, it deepened further afterward, and had lasting consequences for the medieval history of Europe.

Throughout the 5th century, Western emperors were usually figureheads, while the Eastern emperors maintained more independence. For most of the time, the actual rulers in the West were military strongmen who took the titles of ''[[magister militum]]'', [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], or both, such as [[Stilicho]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], and [[Ricimer]]. Although Rome was no longer the capital in the West, it remained the West's largest city and its economic center. But the city was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by rebellious Visigoths in 410]] and [[Sack of Rome (455)|by the Vandals in 455]], events that shocked contemporaries and signaled the disintegration of Roman authority. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] wrote ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' partly as an answer to critics who blamed the sack of Rome by the Visigoths on the abandonment of the traditional [[paganism|pagan]] religions.

In June 474, [[Julius Nepos]] became Western Emperor but in the next year the ''magister militum'' [[Orestes (Roman soldier)|Orestes]] revolted and made his son [[Romulus Augustus]] emperor. Romulus, however, was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and so was technically an usurper, Nepos still being the legal Western Emperor. Nevertheless, Romulus Augustus is often known as the last Western Roman Emperor. In 476, after being refused lands in Italy, Orestes' Germanic mercenaries under the leadership of the chieftain [[Odoacer]] captured and executed Orestes and took [[Ravenna]], the Western Roman capital at the time, deposing Romulus Augustus. The whole of Italy was quickly conquered, and Odoacer was granted the title of patrician by Zeno, effectively recognizing his rule in the name of the Eastern Empire. Odoacer returned the Imperial insignia to Constantinople and ruled as King in Italy. Following Nepos' death [[Theodoric the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]], conquered Italy with Zeno's approval.

Meanwhile, much of the rest of the Western provinces were conquered by [[Migration Period|waves of Germanic invasions]], most of them being disconnected politically from the East altogether and continuing a slow decline. Although Roman political authority in the West was lost, Roman culture would last in most parts of the former Western provinces into the 6th century and beyond.

The first invasions disrupted the West to some degree, but it was the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]] launched by the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the 6th century, and meant to reunite the Empire, that eventually caused the most damage to Italy, as well as straining the Eastern Empire militarily. Following these wars, Rome and other Italian cities would fall into severe decline (Rome itself was almost completely abandoned). Another blow came with the [[Roman-Persian Wars#Climax|Persian invasion of the East]] in the 7th century, immediately followed by the [[Muslim conquests]], especially of [[History of Roman Egypt|Egypt]], which curtailed much of the key trade in the Mediterranean on which Europe depended.

The Empire was to live on in the East for many centuries, and enjoy periods of recovery and cultural brilliance, but its size would remain a fraction of what it had been in classical times. It became an essentially regional power, centered on [[Greece]] and [[Anatolia]]. Modern historians tend to prefer the term ''Byzantine Empire'' for the eastern, medieval stage of the Roman Empire.

===Highlights===
{{See also|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
The decline of the Western Roman Empire was a process spanning many centuries; there is no consensus when it might have begun but many dates and time lines have been proposed by historians.
;3rd century:
* The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (234–284), a period of political instability.
* The reign of Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284–305), who attempted substantial political and economic reforms, many of which would remain in force in the following centuries.

;4th century:
* The reign of [[Constantine I]] (306–337), who built the new eastern capital of [[Constantinople]] and converted to [[Christianity]], legalizing and even favoring to some extent this religion. All Roman emperors after Constantine, except for [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], would be Christians.
* The [[Gothic War (376-382)|first war]] with the [[Visigoths]] (376–382), culminating in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (August 9, 378), in which a large Roman army was defeated by the Visigoths, and Emperor [[Valens]] was killed. The Visigoths, fleeing a migration of the [[Huns]], had been allowed to settle within the borders of the Empire by Valens, but were mistreated by the local Roman administrators, and rebelled.
* The reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379–395), last emperor to reunite under his authority the western and eastern halves of the Empire. Theodosius continued and intensified the policies against [[paganism]] of his predecessors, eventually outlawing it, and making [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaean]] Christianity the [[state religion]].

;5th century:
* The [[Crossing of the Rhine]]: on December 31, 406 (or 405, according to some historians), a mixed band of [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the frozen river [[Rhine]] at Moguntiacum (modern [[Mainz]]), and began to ravage [[Gaul]]. Some moved on to the regions of [[Hispania]] and [[Africa Province|Africa]]. The Empire would never regain control over most of these lands.
* The second war with the Visigoths, led by king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] (410). The Visigoths eventually left Italy and founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in southern Gaul and Hispania.
* The rise of the [[Hunnic Empire]] under [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] and [[Bleda]] (434–453), who raided the [[Balkans]], Gaul, and Italy, threatening both Constantinople and Rome.
* The [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]], this time by the Vandals (455).
* Failed counterstrikes against the Vandals (461–468). The Western Emperor [[Majorian]] planned a naval campaign against the Vandals to reconquer northern Africa in 461, but word of the preparations got out to the Vandals, who took the Roman fleet by surprise and destroyed it. A [[Basiliscus#Disastrous expedition against the Vandals|second naval expedition against the Vandals]], sent by Emperors [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and [[Anthemius]], was defeated at [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|Cape Bon]] in 468.
[[File:476eur.jpg|thumb|center|500px|{{center|Europe in 476, from ''Muir's Historical Atlas'' (1911)}}]]
* Deposition of the last Western Emperors, [[Julius Nepos]] and [[Romulus Augustus]] (475–480). Julius Nepos, who had been nominated by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], was deposed by the rebelled ''magister militum'' [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]], who installed his own son Romulus in the imperial throne. Both Zeno and his rival [[Basiliscus]], in the East, continued to regard Julius Nepos, who fled to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], as the legitimate Western Emperor, and Romulus as an usurper. Shortly after, [[Odoacer]], ''magister militum'' appointed by Julius, invaded Italy, defeated Orestes, and deposed Romulus Augustus on September 4, 476. Odoacer then proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and asked the Eastern Emperor Zeno to become formal Emperor of both empires, and in so doing legalize Odoacer's own position as Imperial viceroy of Italy. Zeno did so, setting aside the claims of Nepos, who was murdered by his own soldiers in 480.
* Foundation of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy (493). Concerned with the success and popularity of Odoacer, Zeno started a campaign against him, at first with words, then by inciting the [[Ostrogoths]] to take back Italy from him. They did as much, but then founded an independent kingdom of their own, under the rule of king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]]. Italy and the entire West were lost to the Empire.

==Theories and explanations of a fall==
The various theories and explanations for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West may be very broadly classified into four schools of thought, although the classification is not without overlap:

* [[#Decay owing to general malaise|Decay owing to general malaise]]
* [[#Monocausal decay|Monocausal decay]]
* [[#Catastrophic collapse|Catastrophic collapse]]
* [[#Transformation|Transformation]]

The tradition positing general malaise goes back to [[Edward Gibbon]] who argued that the edifice of the Roman Empire had been built on unsound foundations to begin with. According to Gibbon, the fall was - in the final analysis - inevitable. On the other hand, Gibbon had assigned a major portion of the responsibility for the decay to the influence of Christianity, and is often, though perhaps unjustly, seen as the founding father of the school of monocausal explanation.

On the other hand, the school of catastrophic collapse holds that the fall of the Empire had not been a pre-determined event and need not be taken for granted. Rather, it was due to the combined effect of a number of adverse processes, many of them set in motion by the [[Migration Period|Migration of the Peoples]], that together applied too much stress to the Empire's basically sound structure.

Finally, the transformation school challenges the whole notion of the 'fall' of the Empire, asking to distinguish between the fall into disuse of a particular political dispensation, anyway unworkable towards its end, and the fate of the Roman civilisation which under-girded the Empire. According to this school, drawing its basic premise from the [[#Henri Pirenne|Pirenne thesis]], the Roman world underwent a gradual (though often violent) series of transformations, morphing into the medieval world. The historians belonging to this school often prefer to speak of [[Late Antiquity]] instead of the Fall of the Roman Empire.

===Decay owing to general malaise===

====Edward Gibbon====
In ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–88), [[Edward Gibbon]] famously placed the blame on a loss of [[civic virtue]] among the Roman citizens. They gradually entrusted the role of defending the Empire to [[Barbarian#Modern academia|barbarian]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] who eventually turned on them. Gibbon held that [[Christianity]] contributed to this shift by making the populace less interested in the worldly ''here-and-now'' because it was willing to wait for the rewards of [[heaven]].

{{quote|The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.}}

{{quote|In discussing Barbarism and Christianity I have actually been discussing the Fall of Rome.}}

====Vegetius on military decline====
Writing in the 5th century, the Roman historian [[Vegetius]] pleaded for reform of what must have been a greatly weakened army. The historian [[Arther Ferrill]] has suggested that the Roman Empire – particularly the military – declined largely as a result of an influx of Germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions. This "Germanization" and the resultant cultural dilution or "barbarization" led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the Empire, but also to a decline of loyalty to the Roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders. Ferrill agrees with other Roman historians such as A.H.M. Jones:
{{quote|...the decay of trade and industry was not a cause of Rome’s fall. There was a decline in agriculture and land was withdrawn from cultivation, in some cases on a very large scale, sometimes as a direct result of barbarian invasions. However, the chief cause of the agricultural decline was high taxation on the marginal land, driving it out of cultivation. Jones is surely right in saying that taxation was spurred by the huge military budget and was thus ‘indirectly’ the result of the barbarian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'' (New York: Thames and Hudson Ltd., 1986),&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke====
In contrast with the declining empire theories, historians such as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argue that the Roman Empire itself was a rotten system from its inception, and that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] times. In their view, the Empire could never have lasted longer than it did without radical reforms that no Emperor could implement. The Romans had no budgetary system and thus wasted whatever resources they had available. The economy of the Empire was a [[Raubwirtschaft]] or plunder economy based on [[looting]] existing resources rather than producing anything new. The Empire relied on riches from conquered territories (this source of revenue ending, of course, with the end of Roman territorial expansion) or on a pattern of tax collection that drove small-scale farmers into destitution (and onto a [[welfare (financial aid)|dole]] that required even more exactions upon those who could not escape taxation), or into dependency upon a landed élite exempt from taxation. With the cessation of tribute from conquered territories, the full cost of their military machine had to be borne by the citizenry.

An economy based upon slave labor precluded a middle class with buying power. The Roman Empire produced few exportable goods. Material innovation, whether through entrepreneurialism or technological advancement, all but ended long before the final dissolution of the Empire. Meanwhile, the costs of military defense and the pomp of Emperors continued. Financial needs continued to increase, but the means of meeting them steadily eroded. In the end, due to economic failure, even the armor and weaponry of soldiers became so obsolete that the enemies of the Empire had better armor and weapons as well as larger forces. The decrepit social order offered so little to its subjects that many saw the barbarian invasion as liberation from onerous obligations to the ruling class.

By the late 5th century the barbarian conqueror [[Odoacer]] had no use for the formality of an Empire upon deposing [[Romulus Augustus]] and chose neither to assume the title of Emperor himself nor to select a puppet, although legally he kept the lands as a commander of the Eastern Empire and maintained the Roman institutions such as the [[consulship]]. The formal end of the Roman Empire on the West in AD 476 thus corresponds with the time in which the Empire and the title Emperor no longer had value.

====Michael Rostovtzeff, Ludwig von Mises, and Bruce Bartlett====
Historian [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] and economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] both argued that unsound economic policies played a key role in the impoverishment and decay of the Roman Empire. According to them, by the 2nd century AD, the Roman Empire had developed a complex [[market economy]] in which trade was relatively free. [[Tariff]]s were low and laws controlling the prices of foodstuffs and other commodities had little impact because they did not fix the prices significantly below their market levels. After the 3rd century, however, [[debasement]] of the currency (i.e., the minting of coins with diminishing content of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]]) led to [[inflation]]. The [[Incomes policy|price control]] laws then resulted in prices that were significantly below their free-market equilibrium levels. It should, however, be noted that [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] initiated a successful [[Constantine the Great#Monetary reforms|reform of the currency]] which was completed before the barbarian invasions of the 4th century, and that thereafter the currency remained sound everywhere that remained within the empire until at least the 11th century - at any rate for gold coins.

According to Rostovtzeff and Mises, artificially low prices led to the scarcity of foodstuffs, particularly in [[city|cities]], whose inhabitants depended on trade to obtain them. Despite laws passed to prevent migration from the cities to the countryside, urban areas gradually became depopulated and many Roman citizens abandoned their specialized trades to practice [[subsistence agriculture]]. This, coupled with increasingly oppressive and arbitrary [[tax]]ation, led to a severe net decrease in trade, [[technology|technical]] innovation, and the overall wealth of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]], and [http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/economics/classics/3015-politics-ideas-the-rise-and-decline-of-civilization-lecture-6-part-3-of-4.html "The Rise and Decline of Civilization"], by [[Ludwig von Mises]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Bartlett]] traces the beginning of debasement to the reign of [[Nero]]. He claims that the emperors increasingly relied on the army as the sole source of their power, and therefore their economic policy was driven more and more by a desire to increase military funding in order to buy the army's loyalty. By the 3rd century, according to Bartlett, the monetary economy had collapsed. But the imperial government was now in a position where it had to satisfy the demands of the army at all costs. Failure to do so would result in the army forcibly deposing the emperor and installing a new one. Therefore, being unable to increase monetary taxes, the Roman Empire had to resort to direct requisitioning of physical goods anywhere it could find them - for example taking food and cattle from farmers. The result, in Bartlett's view, was social chaos, and this led to different responses from the authorities and from the common people. The authorities tried to restore order by requiring free people (i.e. non-slaves) to remain in the same occupation or even at the same place of employment. Eventually, this practice was extended to force children to follow the same occupation as their parents. So, for instance, farmers were tied to the land, and the sons of soldiers had to become soldiers themselves. Many common people reacted by moving to the countryside, sometimes joining the estates of the wealthy, and in general trying to be self-sufficient and interact as little as possible with the imperial authorities. Thus, according to Bartlett, Roman society began to dissolve into a number of separate estates that operated as closed systems, provided for all their own needs and did not engage in trade at all. These were the beginnings of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Tainter====
In his 1988 book ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'', American anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter|Tainter]] presents the view that for given technological levels there are implicit declining returns to complexity, in which systems deplete their resource base beyond levels that are ultimately sustainable. Tainter argues that societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can include differentiated [[social]] and [[economic]] roles, reliance on [[symbol]]ic and [[abstraction|abstract]] [[communication]], and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning [[Natural resource|resources]], or other forms of [[wealth]]). When a society confronts a "problem", such as a shortage of or difficulty in gaining access to [[energy]], it tends to create new layers of [[bureaucracy]], [[infrastructure]], or [[social class]] to address the challenge.

For example, as Roman [[agricultural productivity|agricultural output]] slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans solved this problem in the short term by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (metals, grain, slaves, etc.). However, this solution merely exacerbated the issue over the long term; as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc., increased. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory. At that point, the Empire fragmented into smaller units.

We often assume that the collapse of the Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved. Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were better off (all but the elite, presumably.) Archeological evidence from human bones indicates that average nutrition improved after the collapse in many parts of the former Roman Empire. Average individuals may have benefited because they no longer had to invest in the burdensome complexity of empire.

In Tainter's view, while [[invasions]], [[famine|crop failures]], [[disease]] or [[environmental degradation]] may be the ''apparent'' causes of [[societal collapse]], the ultimate cause is ''diminishing returns on investments in social [[complexity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1988) "The Collapse of Complex Societies" (Princeton Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adrian Goldsworthy====
In ''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], a British military historian, sees the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire not in any 'decadence' in the make-up of the Roman legions, but in a combination of endless civil wars between factions of the Roman Army fighting for control of the Empire. This inevitably weakened the army and the society upon which it depended, making it less able to defend itself against the growing numbers of Rome's enemies. The army still remained a superior fighting instrument to its opponents, both civilized and barbarian; this is shown in the victories over Germanic tribes at the [[Battle of Strasbourg]] (357) and in its ability to hold the line against the Sassanid Persians throughout the 4th century. But, says Goldsworthy, "Weakening central authority, social and economic problems and, most of all, the continuing grind of civil wars eroded the political capacity to maintain the army at this level."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) p. 214 [[Adrian Goldsworthy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsworthy set out in greater detail his theory that recurring civil wars during the late fourth and early fifth centuries contributed to the fall of the West Roman Empire (395-476), in his book ''The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower'' (2009).

===Monocausal decay===

====Disease====
[[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]], a [[World History|world historian]], noted in chapter three of his book ''Plagues and Peoples'' (1976) that the Roman Empire suffered the severe and protracted [[Antonine Plague]] starting around 165 AD. For about twenty years, waves of one or more diseases, possibly the first epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], swept through the Empire, ultimately killing about half the population. Similar [[Pandemic|epidemics]], such as the [[Plague of Cyprian]], also occurred in the 3rd century. McNeill argues that the severe fall in population left the state apparatus and army too large for the population to support, leading to further economic and social decline that eventually killed the [[Western Empire]]. The Eastern half survived due to its larger population, which even after the plagues was sufficient for an effective state apparatus.

Archaeology has revealed that from the 2nd century onward, the inhabited area in most Roman towns and cities grew smaller and smaller. Imperial laws concerning "agri deserti", or deserted lands, became increasingly common and desperate. The economic collapse of the 3rd century may also be evidence of a shrinking population as Rome’s tax base was also shrinking and could no longer support the Roman Army and other Roman institutions.

Rome's success had led to increased contact with Asia though trade, especially in a sea route through the Red Sea that Rome cleared of pirates shortly after conquering Egypt. Wars also increased contact with Asia, particularly wars with the Persian Empire. With increased contact with Asia came increased transmission of disease into the Mediterranean from Asia. Romans used public fountains, public latrines, public baths, and supported many brothels all of which were conducive to the spread of pathogens. Romans crowded into walled cities and the poor and the slaves lived in very close quarters with each other. Epidemics began sweeping though the Empire.

The culture of the German barbarians living just across the Rhine and Danube rivers was not so conducive to the spread of pathogens. Germans lived in small scattered villages that did not support the same level of trade as did Roman settlements. Germans lived in single-family detached houses. Germans did not have public baths nor as many brothels and drank ale made with boiled water. The barbarian population seemed to be on the rise. The demographics of Europe were changing.

Economically, depopulation led to the impoverishment of East and West as economic ties among different parts of the empire weakened. Increasing raids by barbarians further strained the economy and further reduced the population, mostly in the West. In areas near the Rhine and Danube frontiers, raids by barbarians killed Romans and disrupted commerce. Raids also forced Romans into walled towns and cities furthering the spread of pathogens and increasing the rate of depopulation in the West. A low population and weak economy forced Rome to use barbarians in the Roman Army to defend against other barbarians.

====Environmental degradation====
{{further|Deforestation during the Roman period}}

Another theory is that gradual environmental degradation caused population and economic decline. [[Deforestation]] and excessive grazing led to [[erosion]] of meadows and cropland. Increased irrigation without suitable drainage caused [[Soil salinity|salinization]], especially in North Africa. These human activities resulted in fertile land becoming nonproductive and eventually increased desertification in some regions. Many animal species become extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc Lunds universitet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701014145/http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent research of Tainter stated that "deforestation did not cause the Roman collapse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tainter |first=Joseph |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123136 |title=Archeology of Overshoot and Collapse |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |year=2006 |volume=35 |issue= |pages=59–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it could be a minor contributing factor.

Also, high taxes and heavy slavery are another reason for decline as they forced small farmers out of business and into the cities, which became overpopulated. Roman cities were only designed to hold a certain number of people, and once they passed that, disease, water shortage and food shortage became common.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Lead poisoning====
{{See also|Lead poisoning}}

Publishing several articles in the 1960s, the sociologist [[S. Colum Gilfillan|Seabury Colum Gilfillan]] advanced the argument that lead poisoning was a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S. Colum |title=The Inventive Lag in Classical Mediterranean Society |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=85–87 |date=Winter 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1965jan-00131 |title=Roman Culture and Dysgenic Lead Poisoning |journal=The Mankind Quarterly |volume=5 |pages=131–148 |date=1965 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Lead Poisoning and the Fall of Rome |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=53–60|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a posthumously published book elaborated on Gilfillan's work on this topic.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Rome's Ruin by Lead Poison |publisher=Wenzel Press |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that "lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire." His work centred on the level to which the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who had few sweeteners besides [[honey]], would boil [[must]] in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called ''[[defrutum]]'', concentrated again into ''[[sapa (sweetener)|sapa]]''. This syrup was used to some degree to sweeten wine and food.&lt;ref name="Lessler"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead and Lead Poisoning from Antiquity to Modern Times |url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/23252/1/V088N3_078.pdf |accessdate=11 Jan 2009 |author=Milton A. Lessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; If acidic must is boiled within lead vessels the sweet syrup it yields will contain a quantity of [[Lead(II) acetate|Pb(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or lead(II) acetate]].&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; Lead was also leached from the glazes on [[amphora]]e and other pottery, from pewter drinking vessels and cookware, and from lead piping used for municipal water supplies and baths.&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nriagu JO |title=Saturnine gout among Roman aristocrats. Did lead poisoning contribute to the fall of the Empire? |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=308|issue=11|pages=660–3|date=March 1983|pmid=6338384 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198303173081123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main culinary use of ''defrutum'' was to sweeten wine, but it was also added to fruit and meat dishes as a sweetening and souring agent and even given to food animals such as suckling pig and duck to improve the taste of their flesh. ''Defrutum'' was mixed with ''[[garum]]'' to make the popular condiment ''[[oenogarum]]'' and as such was one of Rome's most popular condiments. Quince and melon were preserved in ''defrutum'' and honey through the winter, and some Roman women used ''defrutum'' or ''sapa'' as a cosmetic. ''Defrutum'' was often used as a food preservative in provisions for Roman troops.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Living Dead: Poisoned Roman Babies|publisher=Brighton TV for National Geographic|people=Director: Chris Warren|medium=television|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nriagu produced a table showing his estimated consumption of lead by various classes within the Roman Empire. However, to produce the table Nriagu assumes all of the ''defrutum''/''sapa'' consumed to have been made in lead vessels:&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/r8/ceh/2007/Anderson.pdf|accessdate=11 Jan 2009|title=Children’s Environmental Health: Tribal Nations CEH Summit|author=Mark E.

Lead is not removed quickly from the body.

However, the lead content revealed in many other ancient Roman remains have been shown to have been less than half that of modern Europeans&lt;ref&gt;Drasch
1982:199–231&lt;/ref&gt; which have concentrations between 20-50ppm.&lt;ref name="CLUE"/&gt;

=====Criticism of lead poisoning theory=====
The role and importance of lead poisoning in contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire is the subject of controversy and its importance and validity is discounted by many historians.&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized Nriagu's book as "so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, John (1984). ''The Myth of Lead Poisoning Among the Romans: An Essay Review''&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that ancient authorities were well aware of lead poisoning and that it was not [[endemic (epedemiology)|endemic]] in the Roman empire nor did it cause its fall.

Although ''defrutum'' and ''sapa'' prepared in leaden containers would indubitably have contained toxic levels of lead, the use of leaden containers, though popular, was not the standard and copper was used far more generally. The exact amount of ''sapa'' added to wine was also not standardised and there is no indication how often ''sapa'' was added or in what quantity.

Additionally, Roman authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Naturalis1 xxxiv.50.167&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vitruvius]] recognised the toxicity of lead. Vitruvius, who flourished during [[Augustus]]' time, writes that the Romans knew very well of the dangers.
{{quote|Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from it white lead [cerussa, lead carbonate, PbCO3] is obtained, and this is said to be injurious to the human system. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; water should therefore on no account be conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome.|VIII.6.10–11}}

Nevertheless, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.
{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it. Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome's demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue. By measuring Pb isotope compositions of sediments from the Tiber River and the Trajanic Harbor, the present work shows that "tap water" from ancient Rome had 100 times more lead than local spring waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/16/1400097111 Hugo Delile – Lead in ancient Rome's city waters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/21/ancient-rome-tap-water-contaminated-lead-researchers Ancient Rome's tap water heavily contaminated with lead, researchers say] – ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/04/21/ancient-romes-water-100-times-lead-local-spring-water/ Lead in Ancient Rome’s Water Was 100 Times Natural Levels] – Discover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catastrophic collapse===

====J. B. Bury====
[[J. B. Bury]]'s ''History of the Later Roman Empire'' (1889/1923) challenged the prevailing "theory of moral decay" established by Gibbon as well as the classic "clash of Christianity vs. paganism" theory, citing the relative success of the Eastern Empire, which was resolutely Christian. He held that Gibbon's grand history, though epoch-making in its research and detail, was too monocausal. His main difference from Gibbon lay in his interpretation of facts, rather than disputing any facts. He made it clear that he felt that Gibbon's thesis concerning "moral decay" was viable—but incomplete. Bury's judgment was that:&lt;ref name=bury&gt;Bury, J.B. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#7 History of the Later Roman Empire • Vol. I Chap. IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The gradual collapse of the Roman power ... was the consequence of a series of contingent events. No general causes can be assigned that made it inevitable.}}

Bury held that a number of crises arose simultaneously: economic decline, Germanic expansion, depopulation of Italy, dependency on Germanic ''foederati'' for the military, the disastrous (though Bury believed unknowing) treason of [[Stilicho]], loss of martial vigor, [[Flavius Aëtius|Aetius]]' murder, the lack of any leader to replace Aetius—a series of misfortunes which, in combination, proved catastrophic:
{{quote|The Empire had come to depend on the enrollment of barbarians, in large numbers, in the army, and ... it was necessary to render the service attractive to them by the prospect of power and wealth. This was, of course, a consequence of the decline in military spirit, and of depopulation, in the old civilised Mediterranean countries. The Germans in high command had been useful, but the dangers involved in the policy had been shown in the cases of [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]] and [[Arbogastes]]. Yet this policy need not have led to the dismemberment of the Empire, and but for that series of chances its western provinces would not have been converted, as and when they were, into German kingdoms. It may be said that a German penetration of western Europe must ultimately have come about. But even if that were certain, it might have happened in another way, at a later time, more gradually, and with less violence.

The point of the present contention is that Rome's loss of her provinces in the fifth century was not an "inevitable effect of any of those features which have been rightly or wrongly described as causes or consequences of her general 'decline'". The central fact that Rome could not dispense with the help of barbarians for her wars (''gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus'') may be held to be the cause of her calamities, but it was a weakness which might have continued to be far short of fatal but for the sequence of contingencies pointed out above.&lt;ref name=bury/&gt;}}

====Peter Heather====
[[Peter Heather]], in his ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (2005), maintains the Roman imperial system with its sometimes violent imperial transitions and problematic communications notwithstanding, was in fairly good shape during the first, second, and part of the 3rd centuries AD. According to Heather, the first real indication of trouble was the emergence in Iran of the [[Sassanid]] Persian empire (226–651). As reviewed by one writer on Heather's writing,
{{quote|The Sassanids were sufficiently powerful and internally cohesive to push back [[Roman legions]] from the Euphrates and from much of Armenia and southeast Turkey. Much as modern readers tend to think of the "Huns" as the nemesis of the Roman Empire, for the entire period under discussion it was the Persians who held the attention and concern of Rome and Constantinople. Indeed, 20–25% of the military might of the [[Roman Army]] was addressing the Persian threat from the late third century onward ... and upwards of 40% of the troops under the Eastern Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000350.html Albion's Seedlings: Heather - The Fall of the Roman Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heather goes on to state—in the tradition of Gibbon and Bury—that it took the Roman Empire about half a century to cope with the Sassanid threat, which it did by stripping the western provincial towns and cities of their regional taxation income. The resulting expansion of military forces in the [[Middle East]] was finally successful in stabilizing the frontiers with the Sassanids, but the reduction of real income in the provinces of the Empire led to two trends which, Heather says, had a negative long-term impact. First, the incentive for local officials to spend their time and money in the development of local infrastructure disappeared. Public buildings from the 4th century onward tended to be much more modest and funded from central budgets, as the regional taxes had dried up. Second, Heather says "the landowning provincial literati now shifted their attention to where the money was ... away from provincial and local politics to the imperial bureaucracies." Having set the scene of an Empire stretched militarily by the Sassanid threat, Heather then suggests, using archaeological evidence, that the Germanic tribes on the Empire's northern border had altered in nature since the 1st century. Contact with the Empire had increased their material wealth, and that in turn had led to disparities of wealth sufficient to create a ruling class capable of maintaining control over far larger groupings than had previously been possible. Essentially they had become significantly more formidable foes.

Heather then posits what amounts to a domino theory—namely that pressure on peoples very far away from the Empire could result in sufficient pressure on peoples on the Empire's borders to make them contemplate the risk of full scale immigration to the empire. Thus he links the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion of 376 directly to [[Huns|Hunnic]] movements around the Black Sea in the decade before. In the same way he sees the invasions across the Rhine in 406 as a direct consequence of further Hunnic incursions in [[Germania]]; as such he sees the Huns as deeply significant in the fall of the Western Empire long before they themselves became a military threat to the Empire. He postulates that the Hunnic expansion caused unprecedented immigration in 376 and 406 by barbarian groupings who had become significantly more politically and militarily capable than in previous eras. This impacted an empire already at maximum stretch due to the Sassanid pressure. Essentially he argues that the external pressures of 376–470 could have brought the Western Empire down at any point in its history.

He disputes Gibbon's contention that [[Christianity]] and moral decay led to the decline. He also rejects the political infighting of the Empire as a reason, considering it was a systemic recurring factor throughout the Empire's history which, while it might have contributed to an inability to respond to the circumstances of the 5th century, it consequently cannot be blamed for them. Instead he places its origin squarely on outside military factors, starting with the Sassanids. Like Bury, he does not believe the fall was inevitable, but rather a series of events which came together to shatter the Empire. He differs from Bury, however, in placing the onset of those events far earlier in the Empire's timeline, with the Sassanid rise.

====Bryan Ward-Perkins====
[[Bryan Ward-Perkins]]'s ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'' (2005) takes a traditional view tempered by modern discoveries, arguing that the empire's demise was caused by a vicious circle of political instability, foreign invasion, and reduced tax revenue. Essentially, invasions caused long-term damage to the provincial tax base, which lessened the Empire's medium- to long-term ability to pay and equip the legions, with predictable results. Likewise, constant invasions encouraged provincial rebellion as self-help, further depleting Imperial resources. Contrary to the trend among some historians of the "there was no fall" school, who view the fall of Rome as not necessarily a "bad thing" for the people involved, Ward-Perkins argues that in many parts of the former Empire the archaeological record indicates that the collapse was truly a disaster.

Ward-Perkins' theory, much like Bury's, and Heather's, identifies a series of cyclic events that came together to cause a definite decline and fall.

===Transformation===

==== Henri Pirenne ====
In the second half of the 19th century, some historians focused on the continuities between the Roman Empire and the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms rather than the rupture. In ''Histoire des institutions politiques de l'ancienne France'' (1875–89), [[Fustel de Coulanges]] argued that the barbarians simply contributed to an ongoing process of transforming Roman institutions.

[[Henri Pirenne]] continued this idea with the "Pirenne Thesis", published in the 1920s, which remains influential to this day. It holds that even after the barbarian invasions, the Roman way of doing things did not immediately change; barbarians came to Rome not to destroy it, but to take part in its benefits, and thus they tried to preserve the Roman way of life. The Pirenne Thesis regards the rise of the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish realm in Europe]] as a continuation of the Roman Empire, and thus validates the crowning of [[Charlemagne]] as the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as a successor of the Roman Emperors. According to Pirenne, the real break in Roman history occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries as a result of Arab expansion. Islamic conquest of the area of today's south-eastern Turkey, Syria, Palestine, North Africa, Spain and Portugal ruptured economic ties to western Europe, cutting the region off from trade and turning it into a stagnant backwater, with wealth flowing out in the form of raw resources and nothing coming back. This began a steady decline and impoverishment so that by the time of Charlemagne western Europe had become almost entirely agrarian at a subsistence level, with no long-distance trade. Pirenne's view on the continuity of the Roman Empire before and after the Germanic invasion has been supported by recent historians such as François Masai, [[Karl Ferdinand Werner]], and [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]].

Some modern critics have argued that the "Pirenne Thesis" erred on two counts: by treating the [[Carolingian]] realm as a Roman state and by overemphasizing the effect of the Islamic conquests on the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Other critics have argued that while Pirenne was correct in arguing for the continuity of the Empire beyond the sack of Rome, the Arab conquests in the 7th century may not have disrupted [[Mediterranean]] trade routes to the degree that Pirenne argued. Michael McCormick in particular has argued that some recently unearthed sources, such as collective biographies, describe new trade routes. Moreover, other records and coins document the movement of Islamic currency into the Carolingian Empire. McCormick has concluded that if money was coming in, some type of goods must have been going out – including slaves, timber, weapons, honey, amber, and furs.

==== Lucien Musset and the clash of civilizations ====
In the spirit of "Pirenne thesis", a school of thought pictured a clash of civilizations between the Roman and the Germanic world, a process taking place roughly between 3rd and 8th century.

The French historian [[Lucien Musset]], studying the [[Barbarian invasions]], argues the civilization of [[Medieval]] [[Europe]] emerged from a synthesis between the [[Graeco-Roman]] world and the [[List of Germanic peoples|Germanic]] civilizations penetrating the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire did not fall, did not decline, it just transformed but so did the Germanic populations which invaded it. To support this conclusion, beside the narrative of the events, he offers [[linguistics|linguistic]] surveys of [[toponymy]] and [[anthroponymy]], analyzes archaeological records, studies the urban and rural society, the institutions, the religion, the art, the technology.

==== Late Antiquity ====
Historians of Late Antiquity, a field pioneered by Peter Brown, have turned away from the idea that the Roman Empire fell at all – refocusing instead on Pirenne's thesis. They see a transformation occurring over centuries, with the roots of Medieval culture contained in Roman culture and focus on the continuities between the classical and Medieval worlds. Thus, it was a gradual process with no clear break. Brown argues in his book that:

{{quote|Factors we would regard as natural in a 'crisis'—''malaise'' caused by urbanization, public disasters, the intrusion of alien religious ideas, and a consequent heightening of religious hopes and fears—may not have bulked as large in the minds of the men of the late second and third centuries as we suppose... The towns of the Mediterranean were small towns. For all their isolation from the way of life of the villagers, they were fragile excrescences in a spreading countryside."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Making of Late Antiquity'' (Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1978), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-71043-0003, Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolsheviks]]]]
'''Leninism''' is the [[political theory]] for the organisation of a [[revolution]]ary [[vanguard party]] and the achievement of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as political prelude to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999) pp. 476–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by and named for the Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories, developed from [[Marxism]] and Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theories, for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the [[Russian Empire]] of the early 20th century. Functionally, the Leninist vanguard party was to provide the working class with the [[political consciousness]] (education and organisation) and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in Imperial Russia.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt; After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia and in establishing [[soviet democracy]] the Bolshevik régime suppressed socialists who opposed the revolution, such as the [[Mensheviks]] and factions of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1,558.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922) thus included [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] (1918–1924) that were suppressed in the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (RSFSR) before incorporation to the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) in 1922.

Leninism was composed as and for revolutionary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and originally was neither a rigorously proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. After the Russian Revolution and in ''[[History and Class Consciousness|History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics]]'' (1923), [[György Lukács]] developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices and ideology into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution (Leninism). As a political-science term, "Leninism" entered common usage in 1922 after infirmity ended Lenin's participation in governing the Russian Communist Party. At the Fifth Congress of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] in July 1924, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] popularized the term "Leninism" to denote "vanguard-party revolution". From 1917 to 1922, Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the [[Bolsheviks]], the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the [[working class]].  In the 1925–1929 period, [[Joseph Stalin]] established Leninism as the official and only legitimate form of Marxism in Russia by amalgamating the political philosophies as [[Marxism–Leninism]], which then became the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state ideology of the Soviet Union]].

== Historical background ==
[[File:Lukács György.jpg|thumb|200px|Hungarian philosopher [[György Lukács]] (c. 1952) codified the theory and practice of Leninism in ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923)]]
In the 19th century, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], called for the international political unification of the European [[working class]]es in order to achieve a [[communist revolution]] and proposed that because the socio-economic organization of [[communism]] was of a higher form than that of [[capitalism]], a workers' [[revolution]] would first occur in the economically advanced, industrialized countries. Marxist [[social democracy]] was strongest in Germany throughout the 19th century and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] inspired Lenin and other Russian Marxists.&lt;ref name=lih1&gt;{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Lars|title=Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in Context|year=2005|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-13120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721–1917)—uneven and combined economic development—facilitated rapid and intensive industrialization, which produced a united, working-class [[proletariat]] in a predominantly rural, agrarian, peasant society. Moreover, because the industrialization was financed mostly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary [[bourgeoisie]] with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants (as occurred in the [[French Revolution]], 1789). Although Russia's [[political economy]] principally was agrarian and [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]], the task of democratic revolution therefore fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only [[social class]] capable of effecting land reform and democratization, in view that the Russian propertied classes would attempt to suppress any revolution, in town and country.

In April 1917, Lenin published the [[April Theses]], the political strategy of the [[October Revolution]] (7–8 November 1917), which proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event, but a fundamentally international event—the first world socialist revolution. Thus Lenin's practical application of Marxism and working-class urban revolution to the social, political and economic conditions of the agrarian peasant society that was [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] Russia sparked the "revolutionary nationalism of the poor" to [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] the [[absolute monarchy]] of the three-hundred-year [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty (1613–1917).&lt;ref&gt;''Faces of Janus'' p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
In the course of developing the Russian application of [[Marxism]], the pamphlet ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916) presented Lenin's analysis of an economic development predicted by Karl Marx, namely that capitalism would become a [[global financial system]], wherein advanced industrial countries export [[financial capital]] to their [[Colonialism|colonial]] countries, to finance the exploitation of their natural resources and the labour of the native populations. Such [[Superprofit|superexploitation]] of the poor (undeveloped) countries allows the wealthy (developed) countries to maintain some homeland workers politically content with a slightly higher standard of living and so ensure peaceful labour–capital relations in the capitalist homeland (see [[labour aristocracy]] and [[globalization]]). Hence, a [[proletarian revolution]] of workers and peasants could not occur in the developed capitalist countries while the imperialist global-finance system remained intact; thus an underdeveloped country would feature the first proletarian revolution; and in the early 20th century, [[Imperial Russia]] was the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system.&lt;ref name=tomasic&gt;Tomasic, D. "The Impact of Russian Culture on Soviet Communism" (1953), ''The Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 6, No. 4 December, pp. 808–809.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''United States of Europe Slogan'' (1915), Lenin said: {{quotation|[[Workers of the world, unite!]]—Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible, first in several, or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world.|''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V. I., ''United States of Europe Slogan'', ''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

In ''[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920), Lenin said: {{quotation|The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skillful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest, rift between the enemies, any conflict of interests among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest, opportunity of winning a mass ally, even though this ally is temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern [[scientific socialism]] in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies equally to the period before and after the proletariat has won political power.|''Collected Works'', vol. 31, p. 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder|chapter=No Compromises?|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1920|place=[[Soviet Union]]|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/index.htm|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch08.htm|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

== Leninist praxis ==
{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=all}}

=== The vanguard party ===
In Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), Marx and Engels presented the idea of the vanguard party as solely qualified to politically lead the proletariat in revolution: {{quotation|The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.}}

Hence, the purpose of the Leninist [[vanguard party]] is to establish a democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]; supported by the [[working class]], the vanguard party would lead the revolution to depose the incumbent [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government; and then transfer power of government to the working class, which change of ruling class—from [[bourgeoisie]] to [[proletariat]]—makes possible the full development of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789–1945''. London:1994. pp. 462–464.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin proposed that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign because it was the only way that the [[proletariat]] could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties; and later by the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the "economic campaign" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the "political campaign" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive revolutionary leadership of the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik vanguard party]].

; Democratic centralism
As epitomised in the slogan "Freedom in Discussion, Unity in Action", Lenin followed the example of the [[First International]] (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864–1876) and organised the Bolsheviks as a [[Democratic centralism|democratically centralised]] vanguard party, wherein free political-speech was recognised legitimate until policy consensus. Afterwards, every member of the party would be expected to uphold the official policy established in consensus. In the pamphlet ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'' (1905), Lenin said: {{quotation|Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. [...] The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1905) ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, 1965, Moscow, Volume 10, pages 442-443. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/may/20c.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Full, inner-party democratic debate was Bolshevik Party practice under Lenin, even after the banning of party factions in 1921. Although a guiding influence in policy, Lenin did not exercise absolute power and continually debated and discussed to have his point of view accepted. Under Stalin, the inner-party practice of democratic free debate did not continue after the death of Lenin in 1924.

; Revolution
Before the Revolution, despite supporting political reform (including Bolsheviks elected to the [[Duma]], when opportune), Lenin proposed that [[capitalism]] could ultimately only be overthrown with revolution, not with gradual reforms—from within ([[Fabian Society|Fabianism]]) and from without ([[social democracy]])—which would fail because the ruling [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist social class]], who hold economic power (the [[means of production]]), determine the nature of political power in a bourgeois society.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1917) ''[[The State and Revolution]]'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 25, pp. 381-492. Available online at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/index.htm "The State and Revolution"]. ''Marxists.org''. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As epitomised in the slogan "For a Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry", a revolution in the underdeveloped [[Russian Empire]] required an allied proletariat of town and country (urban workers and peasants) because the urban workers would be too few to successfully assume power in the cities on their own. Moreover, owing to the [[Middle class|middle-class]] aspirations of much of the peasantry, [[Leon Trotsky]] proposed that the proletariat should lead the revolution as the only way for it to be truly socialist and democratic. Although Lenin initially disagreed with Trotsky's formulation, he adopted it before the [[Russian Revolution]] in October 1917.

=== Dictatorship of the proletariat ===
{{Soviet Union sidebar|history}}
{{main|Dictatorship of the proletariat}}
In the Russian socialist society, government by [[direct democracy]] was effected by elected [[soviet (council)|soviets]] (workers' councils), which "soviet government" form Lenin described as the manifestation of the Marxist "democratic dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, 1954. The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As political organisations, the soviets would comprise representatives of factory workers' and trade union committees, but would exclude capitalists as a social class in order to ensure the establishment of a proletarian government, by and for the working class and the peasants. About the political disenfranchisement of the Russian capitalist social classes, Lenin said that "depriving the exploiters of the franchise is a purely Russian question, and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in general. [...] In which countries [...] democracy for the exploiters will be, in one or another form, restricted [...] is a question of the specific national features of this or that capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky", from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, Moscow, Volume 28, 1974, pages 227–325. Available online at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/prrk/ Marxists.org]. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter five of ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' (1917), Lenin describes the dictatorship of the proletariat as such: {{quotation|[...] the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors. [...] An immense expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich [...] and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people—this is the change which democracy undergoes during the 'transition' from capitalism to communism.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher. ''Lenin and the Russian Revolution'' (1971). Penguin Books. London p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About democracy, Lenin further stated the following in ''The State and Revolution'': {{quotation|Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, of the [[Exploitation of labour|exploiters]] and oppressors of the people—this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.|''Collected Works'', vol. 25, pp. 461–462&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx Engels Lenin on Scientific Socialism|publisher=Novosti Press Ajency Publishing House|place=Moscow|year=1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmeHGAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soviet constitutionalism was the collective government form of the Russian dictatorship of the proletariat, the opposite of the government form of the dictatorship of capital (privately owned means of production) practised in bourgeois democracies. In the soviet political system, the (Leninist) vanguard party would be one of many political parties competing for elected power.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution From Lenin to Stalin: 1917-1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the circumstances of the Red vs. White [[Russian Civil War]] and terrorism by the opposing political parties and in aid of the [[White Army|White Armies']] counter-revolution led to the Bolshevik government banning other parties, thus the vanguard party became the sole, legal political party in Russia. Lenin did not regard such political suppression as philosophically inherent to the dictatorship of the proletariat, yet the Stalinists retrospectively claimed that such factional suppression was original to Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. Lenin's Last Struggle. (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution, from Lenin to Stalin: 1917–1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
The Soviet Union nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive co-ordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted [[War Communism]] (1918–1921) as a necessary condition—adequate supplies of food and weapons—for fighting the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1923).&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"/&gt; Later in March 1921, he established the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP, 1921–1929), which allowed measures of private commerce, internal free trade and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax under the management of state banks. The purpose of the NEP was to resolve food-shortage riots among the peasantry and allowed measures of private enterprise, wherein the [[profit motive]] encouraged the peasants to harvest the crops required to feed the people of town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many men (workers) to the counter-revolutionary Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' Chris Cook, editor (1983) Peter Bedrick Books:New York p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. ''The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Departments'', Report to the Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Departments, 17 October 1921, from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', 2nd English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 33, pp. 60–79. Available at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With the NEP, the socialist nationalisation of the economy could then be developed to industrialise Russia, strengthen the working class and raise standards of living, thus the NEP would advance socialism against capitalism. Lenin regarded the appearance of new socialist states in the developed countries as necessary to the strengthening Russia's economy and the eventual development of socialism. In that, he was encouraged by the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920 and industrial unrest in Britain, France and the United States.

=== National self-determination ===
Lenin recognized and accepted the existence of [[nationalism]] among oppressed peoples, advocated their national rights to [[self-determination]] and opposed the ethnic chauvinism of "[[Eurasianism|Greater Russia]]" because such [[ethnocentrism]] was a [[Cultural hegemony|cultural]] obstacle to establishing the proletarian dictatorship in the territories of the deposed [[Russian Empire]] (1721–1917).&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

''The State in Socialist Society'', second edition (1984) St. Antony's College: Oxford, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Right of Nations to Self-Determination|The Right of Nations to Self-determination]]'' (1914), Lenin said: {{quotation|We fight against the privileges and violence of the oppressor nation, and do not in any way condone strivings for privileges on the part of the oppressed nation. [...] The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness. [...] Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

The internationalist philosophies of [[Bolshevism]] and of [[Marxism]] are based upon [[class struggle]] transcending nationalism, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[religion]], which are [[intellectualism|intellectual]] obstacles to class consciousness because the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ruling classes manipulated said cultural ''status quo'' to politically divide the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] working classes. To overcome the political barrier of nationalism, Lenin said it was necessary to acknowledge the existence of nationalism among oppressed peoples and to guarantee their national independence as the right of secession; and that based upon national self-determination, it was natural for socialist states to transcend nationalism and form a federation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. ''Lenin's Last Struggle'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Question of Nationalities, or "Autonomisation"'' (1923), Lenin said the following: {{quotation|[...] nothing holds up the development and strengthening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice; "offended" nationals are not sensitive to anything, so much as to the feeling of equality, and the violation of this equality, if only through negligence or jest—to the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

=== Socialist culture ===
The role of the Marxist vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal [[false consciousness]] of religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural ''status quo'' taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of peasant and worker. Influenced by Lenin, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party]] stated that the development of the socialist workers' culture should not be "hamstrung from above" and opposed the ''[[Proletkult]]'' (1917–1925) organisational control of the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Central Committee, ''On Proletcult Organisations'', ''Pravda'' No. 270, 1 December 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leninism after 1924 ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|related}}
In post-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] Russia, [[Stalinism]] ([[socialism in one country]]) and [[Trotskyism]] ([[Permanent revolution|permanent world revolution]]) were the principal philosophies of [[communism]] that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism, thus within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], each ideological faction denied the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of the opposing faction.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000) p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Lenin vs. Stalin
Until shortly before his death, Lenin worked to counter the disproportionate political influence of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Communist Party and in the bureaucracy of the Soviet government, partly because of abuses he had committed against the populace of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and partly because the autocratic Stalin had accumulated administrative power disproportionate to his office of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe.

(1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-action against Stalin aligned with Lenin's advocacy of the right of [[self-determination]] for the national and ethnic groups of the former Tsarist Empire, which was a key theoretic concept of Leninism.&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1979"/&gt; Lenin warned that Stalin has "unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution" and formed a factional bloc with [[Leon Trotsky]] to remove Stalin as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"&gt;Deutscher, Isaac 1959. ''The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921-1929'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. 1923-24 ''"Last Testament" Letters to the Congress'', in ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 36 pp. 593–611. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/testamnt/congress.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end followed proposals reducing the administrative powers of party posts in order to reduce bureaucratic influence upon the policies of the Communist Party. Lenin advised Trotsky to emphasize Stalin's recent bureaucratic alignment in such matters (e.g. undermining the anti-bureaucratic workers' and peasants' Inspection) and argued to depose Stalin as General Secretary. Despite advice to refuse "any rotten compromise", Trotsky did not heed Lenin's advice and General Secretary Stalin retained power over the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the soviet government.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

; Trotskyism vs. Stalinism
After Lenin's death (21 January 1924), Trotsky ideologically battled the influence of Stalin, who formed ruling blocs within the Russian Communist Party (with [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], then with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and then by himself) and so determined soviet government policy from 1924 onwards. The ruling blocs continually denied Stalin's opponents the right to organise as an opposition faction within the party—thus the re-instatement of democratic centralism and free speech within the Communist Party were key arguments of Trotsky's [[Left Opposition]] and the later Joint Opposition.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, Leon 1927. ''Platform of the Joint Opposition''. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1927/opposition/index.htm Marxists.rog]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leon Trotsky]] was exiled from Russia after losing to [[Joseph Stalin]] in the factional politics of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]]]
In the course of instituting government policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]] (adopted 1925), wherein the Soviet Union would establish [[socialism]] upon Russia's economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). Conversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the Soviet Union and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries that had arisen in the developed world—which was essential for maintaining Soviet democracy—in 1924 much undermined by [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and [[White Army|counter-revolution]]. Furthermore, Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]] proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would go further towards dismantling [[Feudalism|feudal]] régimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should politically ally with peasant political organisations, but not with capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where communists were too few. However, said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the [[Northern Expedition]] portion of the Chinese Revolution (1925–1927), wherein it resulted in the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Kuomintang]]'s massacre of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. Despite the failure, Stalin's policy of mixed-ideology political alliances nonetheless became [[Communist International|Comintern]] policy.

; The Oppositionists
[[File:Stalin-Lenin-Kalinin-1919.jpg|thumb|The "[[Old Bolshevik]]s" (Stalin, Lenin and [[Mikhail Kalinin]], pictured in 1919) were members of the Bolshevik Party before the [[Russian Revolution]]]]
Until exiled from Russia in 1929, Trotsky helped develop and led the Left Opposition (and the later Joint Opposition) with members of the Workers' Opposition, the Decembrists and (later) the Zinovievists.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt; Trotskyism ideologically predominated the political platform of the Left Opposition, which demanded the restoration of soviet democracy, the expansion of democratic centralism in the Communist Party, national industrialisation, international permanent revolution and socialist internationalism. The Trotskyist demands countered Stalin's political dominance of the Russian Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the "[[Cult of personality|cult of Lenin]]", the rejection of permanent revolution and the doctrine of socialism in one country. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing capitalist [[kulak]] interests in the countryside and destroying them. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia, but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of the policy towards the kulak social class of wealthy peasants and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described the vacillating Stalinist policy as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, L.D. (1938) ''The Revolution Betrayed''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and of the Trotskyists in Russia, by means of slander, [[antisemitism]], programmed [[censorship]], expulsions, exile (internal and external) and imprisonment. The anti–Trotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the [[Moscow Trials]] (1936–1938), which were part of the [[Great Purge]] of [[Old Bolshevik]]s (who had led the Revolution).&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin, Vadim Z. ''Stalin's Terror of 1937-1938: Political Genocide in the USSR''. (2009) translated to English by Frederick S. Choate, from the Russian-language ''Party of the Executed'' by Vadim Z. Rogovin.&lt;/ref&gt; Once established as ruler of the Soviet Union, General Secretary Stalin re-titled the official socialism in one country doctrine as [[Marxism–Leninism]] to establish ideologic continuity with Leninism whilst opponents continued calling it Stalinism.

== Philosophic successors ==
In political practice, Leninism ([[Vanguard party|vanguard-party]] revolution), despite its origin as communist revolutionary praxis, was adopted throughout the political spectrum.
* In China, the [[Communist Party of China]] is organised as a Leninist vanguard party, based upon [[Maoism]] (Mao Zedong Thought), the Chinese practical application of [[Marxism–Leninism]], that is [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]].&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Yongnian, ''The Chinese Communist Party as Organizational Emperor'' (2009) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Singapore, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) was organised as a Leninist political party featuring internal democracy. The PAP initiated single-party dominance in the government and popular politics of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wilson, ''Economic growth and development in Singapore'' (2002) p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, the practical application of Maoism to the socio-economic conditions of  [[Third World]] countries produced revolutionary vanguard parties, such as the [[Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Roberts, ''Deepening Democracy?: The Modern Left and Social Movements  in Chile and Peru'' (1988) pp 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In ''The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution'' (1918), Marxist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] criticized the Bolsheviks and their policies for: the suppression of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|All Russian Constituent Assembly]] (January 1918); the [[Partition (politics)|partitioning]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal estates]] to the peasant communes; and the right of self-determination of every national people of the Russias. Luxemburg said that the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create great dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratisation]] that would arise to administrate the oversized country that was Bolshevik Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg|title=The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution (Rosa Luxemburg, 1918)|publisher=Libcom.org|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of expedient revolutionary practise, Lenin criticised  in ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920) the political and ideological complaints of the anti-Bolshevik critics who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the political-left of Lenin.

In Marxist philosophy, the term "[[left communism]]" identifies a range of communist political perspectives that are left-wing among communists. Left communism criticizes the ideology that the [[Bolshevik Party]] practiced as a revolutionary vanguard at certain periods of their history. Ideologically, left communists present their perspective and approach as more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and more oriented to the [[proletariat]] than it is the Leninism of the [[Communist International]] at their first (1919) and second (1920) congresses. Proponents of left communism include [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Advance Without Authority': Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals'' by Chamsy Ojeili, Democracy &amp; Nature, vol. 7, no. 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Left communism#Dutch–German left communism until 1933|Dutch–German communist left]] has been most critical of Lenin and Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/gorter/1920/open-letter/index.htm "Herman Gorter, Open Letter to Comrade Lenin, 1920"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1938/lenin/ "Anton Pannekoek: Lenin As Philosopher (1938)"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1939/ruhle01.htm "Rühle: Struggle Against Bolshevism (Intro)"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Left communism#Italian left communism 1926–1939|Italian communist left]] instead still identified as Leninists; Bordiga said: "All this work of demolishing opportunism and "deviationism" (Lenin: ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'') is today the basis of party activity. The party follows revolutionary tradition and experiences in this work during these periods of revolutionary reflux and the proliferation of opportunist theories which had as their violent and inflexible opponents Marx, Engels, Lenin and the Italian Left.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1951/fundamental-theses.htm "Fundamental Theses of the Party by Amadeo Bordiga 1951"].&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Mattick continues in the [[Council communism|council communist]] tradition which begun by the Dutch–German left and so is also critical of Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1935/lenin-legend.htm "The Leninn Legend by Paul Mattick"].&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary left-communist organisations, such as the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]] and the [[International Communist Current]], view Lenin as an important and influential theorist, but remain critical of Leninism as political praxis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2017-10-06/the-significance-of-the-russian-revolution-for-today "The Significance of the Russian Revolution for Today"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2015-01-21/lenin-s-legacy "Lenin's Legacy"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.internationalism.org/ir/96/leninists "Have we become "Leninists"? - part 1"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bordigism|Bordigist]] ideology of the [[International Communist Party]] follow Bordiga's strict adherence to Leninism. The recent [[communisation]] current has been influenced by left communism and is critical of Lenin and Leninism, being more ideologically aligned with the Dutch–German left than the Italian left, wherein the theorist of communisation [[Gilles Dauvé]] criticised Leninism as a "by-product of [[Kautskyism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/files/Gilles%20Dauv%C3%A9-%20The%20Renegade%20Kautsky%20and%20his%20Disciple%20Lenin.pdf "Gilles Dauvé - The Renegade Kautsky and his Disciple Lenin"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Soviet Union Versus Socialism'' (1986), [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that [[Stalinism]] was a logical extension of Leninism, and not an ideological deviation from Lenin's policies. It resulted in [[collectivization]] and enforced the law with a [[police state]], functions of the state continually supported with a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/the-other-killing-machine.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Other Killing Machine|author=Steven Merritt Miner|date=11 May 2003|publisher=''The New York Times''|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm|author=Noam Chomsky|title=The Soviet Union Versus Socialism|publisher=Our Generation|date=Spring–Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizième siècle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450–1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972).

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B.

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945.

The '''Mandate of Heaven''' or '''Tian Ming''' ({{zh|t=天命|p=Tiānmìng|w=T'ien-ming}}) is a Chinese political and religious [[doctrine]] used since [[ancient China|ancient times]] to justify the rule of the [[King of China|King]] or [[Emperor of China]]. According to this belief, heaven  (天, ''[[Tian]]'')—which embodies the natural order and will of the universe—bestows the mandate on a [[justice|just ruler]] of China, the "[[Son of Heaven]]" of the "[[Celestial Empire]]". If a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief among citizens that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven's displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Kallie|title=What Is the Mandate of Heaven in China?|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/ancientchina/f/What-Is-The-Mandate-Of-Heaven.htm|website=About Education|access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dynastic Cycle .gif|thumb|A brief flow chart describing the dynastic cycles in Imperial China on claiming to withdrawing the Mandate of Heaven]]
The Mandate of Heaven does not require a legitimate ruler to be of noble birth, depending instead on the just and able performance of the rulers and their heirs. Dynasties such as the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] were founded by men of common origins. The concept is in some ways similar to the European concept of the [[divine right of kings]]; however, unlike the European concept, it does not in theory confer an unconditional right to rule, despite this being exactly the case in practicality. The Mandate would in theory be a preoccupation in a ruler's lifetime, when he would hold onto the Mandate and live according to Heavens. Intrinsic to the concept of the Mandate of Heaven was the [[right of rebellion]] against an unjust ruler. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler. Throughout [[Chinese history]], times of [[poverty]] and [[natural disasters]] were often taken as signs that heaven considered the incumbent ruler unjust and thus in need of replacement. The Mandate of Heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in China as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler. While each dynasty was not the same, they each had a lineage that passed on the prospective ruler by order of generational descent or their priority of birth. Many emperors during the imperial times would optimize to have many sons who could be candidates to fill the position after the current ruler has died. In addition Heaven was thought to be of how a ruler's works and performance was, which reflected upon how favorable they would be to Heaven.

[[Mencius]], a great philosopher who many thought was the successor to [[Confucius]], said:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56648867|title=Mencius|last=Mencius.|date=2004|publisher=Penguin|others=Lau, D. C. (Dim Cheuk)|isbn=9780140449716|edition= Rev.|location=London|oclc=56648867}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=The people are of supreme importance; the altars of the gods of earth and grain come next; last comes the ruler. That is why he who gains the confidence of the multitudinous people will be Emperor... When a feudal lord endangers the altars of the gods of earth and grain, he should be replaced. When the sacrificial animals are sleek, the offerings are clean and the sacrifices are observed at due times, and yet floods and droughts come [by the agency of heaven], then the altars should be replaced.|sign=Mencius|source=}}

The concept of the Mandate of Heaven was first used to support the rule of the [[king]]s of the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE), and legitimize their overthrow of the earlier [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1069 BCE). It was used throughout the history of China to legitimize the successful overthrow and installation of new emperors, including non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic monarchs such as the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912). This concept was also used by monarchs in neighboring countries like Korea and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Brian|title=Why the North Vietnamese will keep fighting|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P4395-1.pdf|website=RAND|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The right to rule and the right of rebellion ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed. In China, the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler has been a part of political philosophy ever since the Zhou dynasty, and the successful rebellion was interpreted by Chinese historians as evidence that divine approval had passed on to the successive dynasty. The Right of Rebellion is not coded into any official law. Rather, rebellion is always outlawed and severely punished; but is still a positive right grounded in the Chinese moral system. Often, it is used as a justification for actions to overthrow a previous dynasty after a rebellion has been successful and a new dynastic rule has been established. Since the winner is the one who determines who has obtained the Mandate of Heaven and who has lost it, some Chinese scholars consider it to be a sort of [[Victor's justice]], best characterized in the popular Chinese saying "The winner becomes king, the loser becomes outlaw" (Chinese: “[[Wikt:成者為王，敗者為寇|成者爲王，敗者爲寇]]”). 

Due to the above, it is considered that Chinese historical accounts of the fall of a dynasty and the rise of a new one must be handled with caution. Chinese traditional historical compilation methods produce accounts that tend to fit their account to the theory; emphasizing aspects tending to prove that the old dynasty lost the Mandate of Heaven and the new one gained it, and de-emphasize other aspects.

== Transition between the Shang and the Zhou ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The prosperous Shang dynasty saw its rule filled with many outstanding accomplishments. Notably, the dynasty lasted for a considerable time during which 31 kings ruled over an extended period of 17 generations. During this period, the dynasty enjoyed a period of peace and tranquility in which citizens could make a good living. The government was originally able to control most of its internal affairs due to the firm support provided by the people. As time went on, however, the rulers' abuse of the other social classes led to social unrest and instability. The corruption in this dynasty created the conditions necessary for a new ruling house to rise {{mdash}}the Zhou dynasty. Rebellion against the Shang was led by [[King Wu of Zhou|Zhou Wu]]. They created the Mandate of Heaven to explain their right to assume rule and presumed that the only way to hold the mandate was to rule well in the eyes of Heaven. They believed that the Shang ruling house had become morally corrupt, and that the Shang leaders' loss of virtue entitled their own house to take over. The overthrow of the Shang Dynasty, they said, was in accordance with the mandate given by Heaven.&lt;ref name="Tignor, Robert L. 2014"&gt;Tignor, Robert L., et al. Worlds together, worlds apart. 4th ed., vol. 1, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] became the ruling dynasty, they mostly appointed their own officials. The Zhou Dynasty had their own way of assigning their officials. However, in order to appease some of the citizens, they allowed some [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] beneficiaries to continue governing their small kingdoms in compliance with Zhou rules and regulations.  As the empire continued to expand, intermarriage increased because the rulers believed that it was a method of forming strong alliances that enabled them to absorb more countries into the dynasty. In case of a war, the Zhou dynasty boasted an excellent military and technology mostly because of influence from annexed countries. They also excelled in shipbuilding, which, coupled with their discovery of [[celestial navigation]], made them excellent mariners. Intellectually, the Zhou excelled in fields of literature and philosophy while many governmental positions were filled according to the intellectual ability of a candidate. A large amount of literature survives from the Zhou period, including the ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'', ''[[Classic of History|Book of History]]'', ''Book of Etiquette'', ''[[Book of Song]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Odes]]'', and the ''[[Book of Rites]]''. Most of these works are commentaries on the progress and political movement of the dynasty. In philosophical terms, [[Confucius]] and his followers played an important role in shaping the mentality of the government as defined by the [[Five Confucian Relationships]]. These critical thinkers served as a foundation for the government. Their works primarily stressed the importance of the ruling class, respect and their relationship with the lower class. Due to the growing size of the dynasty, it became apparent that a centralized government would lead to a lot of confusion and corruption because the government would not be able to exert its influence or accede to the needs of everyone. To address this political barrier, the dynasty formed a decentralized government in which the empire was broken down into sections. Within these districts were administrators who were appointed by the government, in return, they had to maintain their allegiance to the main internal government. In effect, the Zhou dynasty became a collection of districts. Consequently, this marked the fall of the dynasty as it became difficult for the central government to exert influence on all other regions of the empire.

Finally, when the Zhou dynasty's power decreased, it was wiped out by the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], which believed that the Zhou had become weak and their rule unjust.&lt;ref name="Tignor, Robert L. 2014"/&gt; This transition emphasizes the customary trend of the Mandate of Heaven, which provided leeway for the rise of a new power. The Qin initially attempted to capitalize on the errors made by the Zhou, either by eliminating the source of error or reforming it. During this reformation, administrative changes were made and a system of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was developed which stated that the law is supreme over every individual, including the rulers. Although significant progress was made during the Qin dynasty, the persecution of scholars and ordinary citizens led to an unstable state.

After the death of [[Qin Shihuang]], first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], a widespread revolt by prisoners, peasants, and unhappy soldiers inevitably led to the fall of the Qin dynasty due to its tyrannical practices.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The establishment of the [[Han dynasty]] marked a great period in China’s history marked by significant changes in the political structure of the country. Under the Han emperors, significant changes were made in which the government introduced entrance examinations known as civil service or [[imperial examination]]s for governmental positions. Additionally, the Han dynasty prospered economically through the [[Silk Road]] and other trading means.

== Five Dynasties period ==
{{Main|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period}}

During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, there was no dominant Chinese dynasty that ruled all of China. This created a problem for the [[Song dynasty]] that followed, as they wanted to legitimize their rule by claiming that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on them. The scholar-official [[Xue Juzheng]] compiled the ''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties]]'' (五代史) during the 960s and 970s, after the Song dynasty had taken northern [[China]] from the last of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties]], the [[Later Zhou]].  A major purpose was to establish justification for the transference of the Mandate of Heaven through these five dynasties, and thus to the Song dynasty. He argued that these dynasties met certain vital criteria to be considered as having attained the Mandate of Heaven despite never having ruled all of China.  One is that they all ruled the traditional Chinese heartland.  They also held considerably more territory than any of the other Chinese states that had existed conterminously in the south.

However, there were certain other areas where these dynasties all clearly fell short.  The brutal behavior of [[Zhu Wen]] and the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] was a source of considerable embarrassment, and thus there was pressure to exclude them from the Mandate.  The following three dynasties, the [[Later Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], and [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] were all non-Han Chinese dynasties, all having been ruled by the [[Shatuo]] ethnic minority.  There is also the concern that though each of them was the most powerful Chinese kingdom of its respective era, none of them ever really had the ability to unify the entire Chinese realm as there were several powerful states to the south.  However, it was the conclusion of [[Xue Juzheng]] that the Mandate had indeed passed through each of the Five Dynasties, and thus onto the Song Dynasty when it conquered the last of those dynasties.

== Transition between the Ming and the Qing ==
In previous dynasties the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties reigned for much of the beginning three centuries where the mandate of heaven was questioned heavily between dynastic councils among each emperor. Some emperors were not entirely sure of their validity when it came to claiming the mandate, for it was ambiguous. Especially for the case of the [[Jurchen Jin]], where much of the council was not sure how to discern the validity of their rulers. From the [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty]] to [[Kangxi Emperor]] much of the chosen emperors contemplated much of this when they became a contender for the mandate. The reason for this was because of the ambiguity of the Mandate and overwhelmingly unofficial formality when declaring the Mandate of Heaven. However, [[Kublai Khan|Kubilai Khan]] was the only indifferent ruler when he claimed the Mandate of Heaven over the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] since he had a sizable military and was part of the [[Khitan people]], as with many others from the same background since they did not have the same traditions and culture as their Chinese adversaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial China|last=Porter|first=Jonathan|publisher=Rowland &amp; Littlefield, Inc|date=February 12, 2016|isbn=9781442222922|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said that the peasant group of the Ming dynasty were the real selectors which allowed for the Mandate of Heaven to be claimed by the ruler. As a prospective candidate to the Mandate, they could please the peasantry group in order to win favor amongst the dynasty. It was solely politics from beginning to end and an attempt from the emperor to maintain a favorable act towards Heaven. Many emperors within the Qing dynasty looked immensely within themselves trying to come to terms with their ruling if natural disasters occurred within their time. This was interpreted as a warning of Heaven's displeased wrath towards an emperors ruling, such that the Mandate under their rule was unstable. Furthermore, Qing emperors would take their advisors feedback very seriously when pertaining to ruling and take it upon themselves to reflect on their current decisions of the dynastic overview in hopes that it favors Heaven.

== Neighboring countries==
The concept of the Mandate of Heaven eventually spread to nearby countries as a justification for rule by divine political legitimacy. In Korea, it was first adopted by the [[Joseon]] dynasty and became an enduring state ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diplomat|first1=Gi-Wook Shin and Rennie J. Moon, The|title=South Korea's President Lost the 'Mandate of Heaven'|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/south-koreas-president-lost-the-mandate-of-heaven/|website=The Diplomat|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japan]]ese government found the concept ideologically problematic, preferring not to have divine political legitimacy that was conditional and that could be withdrawn. The Japanese [[Taihō Code]], formulated in 703, was largely an adaptation of the governmental system of [[China]]'s then [[Tang dynasty]], but the Mandate of Heaven was specifically omitted. In later times, this need was obviated because the [[Imperial House of Japan]] claimed to be descended in an unbroken line from the Japanese [[Solar deity|sun goddess]], [[Amaterasu]]. Nevertheless, while maintaining this role, the Japanese emperor became politically marginalized in the Nara and [[Heian period]]s by powerful regents of the [[Fujiwara clan]] who seized executive control of state.  Even though the Japanese imperial line itself remained unbroken after the eighth century, actual political authority passed through successive dynasties of regents and ''[[shōgun]]s'' which cycled in a manner similar to that of Chinese dynasties.  Even after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, when the emperor was placed back in the center of the political bureaucracy, the throne itself had very little power vis-à-vis the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Actual political power has passed through at least four systems since the Meiji restoration: the [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]], the [[Japanese militarism|militarists]], the [[Occupation of Japan]], and [[Post-Occupation Japan|postwar democracy]].  The emperor today is a political figurehead and not a ruling sovereign. It could be said the imperial line of Japan survived for so long precisely because it did not have control over the state, and that the turmoil of succession was projected onto a series of proxy rulers.

[[Image:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by the 19th-century [[England|English]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]. Traditional English fairytales depicting [[elves]], [[fairy|fairies]] and [[pixie]]s are set on a "Merrie England" setting of woodland and cottage gardens.]]

"'''Merry England'''", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "'''Merrie England'''" (also styled as "'''Merrie Olde England'''"), refers to an [[England|English]] [[autostereotype]], a [[utopia]]n conception of [[English culture|English society and culture]] based on an [[idyll]]ic [[pastoral]] way of life that was allegedly prevalent in [[Early Modern Britain]] at some time between the [[Middle Ages]] and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. More broadly, it connotes a putative [[essentialism|essential]] [[Englishness]] with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such [[cultural icon|cultural symbols]] as the [[thatched cottage]], the [[country inn]] and the [[Sunday roast]].

"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which [[Oxford]] [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" ''Folklore'' '''102'''.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental [[nostalgic]] imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of ''Merry England'' originated in the Middle Ages, when [[Henry of Huntingdon]] around 1150 first coined the phrase ''Anglia plena jocis''.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], who claimed that "England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Ronald Hutton]]'s study of churchwardens' accounts&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700''.&lt;/ref&gt; places the real consolidation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, [[boy bishop]]s and decorated [[rood loft]]s. Hutton argued that, far from being [[Paganism|pagan survivals]], many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: "Merry England" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hodgkinson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/17/merryenglandwasrealenough 17 November 2006] - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The same concept ''may'' have also been used to describe a [[utopia]]n state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see [[Cockaigne]]).{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} Peasant revolts, such as those led by [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]] invoked a [[visionary]] idea that was also [[egalitarian]] – [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] arguing for "wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. B. Bury ed, ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term "[[Norman yoke]]" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom.  The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – [[Lawrence Stone]] describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (London 1979) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''Th stripping of the Altars'' (London 1992) p. 42;L. Marcus, ''The Politic of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game”&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 95, p. 192 and p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. [[William Langland|Langland]] might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a ''Hey-nonny-nonny''”.&lt;ref&gt;J. F Goodridge ed., ''Piers the Ploughman'' (Penguin 1966) p. 41 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The wandering scholar, or [[goliard]], who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose,&lt;ref&gt;H. Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking,&lt;ref&gt;D. Baker ed., ''The Early Middle Ages'' (London 1966) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Berners, quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, [[mummers]], morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers,&lt;ref&gt;S Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (London 2005) pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly ''merriment'' in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the [[Black Death]] when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and [[serfdom]] was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''History of England'' (London 1926) pp. 242, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the "lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days",&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Alatars'' (London 1992) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, ''1599'' (London 2005) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400–1700'' (Oxford 1994) Ch II. For methodological criticism, see however Katherine L. French, ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1995), 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and including such customs as [[Parish ale|church ales]], may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

However a reaction quickly set in, [[John Caius]] in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called "the old world, when this country was called merry England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; James I in 1618 issued his [[Book of Sports]], specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service;&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of "Merry England" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War.  Unsurprisingly, the [[Long Parliament]] put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove [[Christmas]] underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural revivals==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Gate of Calais|O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais)]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] contrasts English plenty with French and Jacobite Highlander misery.]]

At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving illustrating the patriotic song "[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]" (''see illustration''), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

[[William Hazlitt]]'s essay "Merry England", appended to his ''Lectures on the English Comic Writers'' (1819),&lt;ref&gt;It was often reprinted in collections of Hazlitt's essays, and, tellingly, included in Ernest Rhys' compilation of sentimental patriotism ''The Old Country: a Book of  Love and Praise of England'', first published in  1917, as the First World War was coming to an end, and republished in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an [[allusion]] to the iconic figure of [[Robin Hood]], under the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] "St George for merry England!":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of [[Sherwood Forest|'Merry Sherwood']], and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to ''Merry England''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England'' (1844: translated as ''The Condition of the Working Class in England''), [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote sarcastically of [[Young England]] (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore "the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ..."  The phrase "merry England" appears in English in the German text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_486.htm|title=Friedrich Engels - Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England - Die Stellung der Bourgeoisie zum Proletariat|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CRANE a garland for mayday 1895.jpg|thumb|left|"A Garland for May Day 1895" woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

[[William Cobbett]] provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and ''mores'' of an industrialising nation&lt;ref&gt;William Sambrook, ''William Cobbett'' (1973), ch. I "Merry England?"&lt;/ref&gt; by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] also subscribed to some extent to the "Merry England" view. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' by [[Thomas Love Peacock]]  contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social  unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. "Hurrah for Merry England", was set twice to music and printed in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the [[Gothic revival]] promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—"Norman" for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], "[[Early English Period|Early English]]", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically ''English'' style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named "[[Jacobethan]]". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by [[Joseph Nash]] (1839–1849), illustrating ''The Mansions of England in the Olden Time'' in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and [[farthingale]]s, who personified a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.

Children's storybooks and [[fairytales]] written in the [[Victorian period]] often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as [[elves]] and [[fairy|fairies]], as well as [[Robin Hood]]. In popular culture, the adjective ''Dickensian'' is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but [[Charles Dickens]]'s view of the rural past evoked [[nostalgia]], not [[fantasy]]. [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]]'s world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the [[stagecoach]] before the advent of the [[railway]]s.

The London-based [[Anglo-Catholic]] magazine of prose and verse ''Merry England'' began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by [[William Wordsworth]] as epigraph, beginning "They called thee 'merry England' in old time" and characterizing ''Merry England'' "a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief":
&lt;poem&gt;
'''...Can, I ask,'''
    This face of rural beauty be a mask
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime?—
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?—
    Forbid it, Heaven! —that Merry England still
    May be they rightful name, in prose or rhyme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late Victorian era, the Tory [[Young England]] set perhaps best reflected the vision of "Merry England" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to [[political conservatism]], the vision of "Merry England" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane [[clergy]]; an interested and [[altruism|altruistic]] [[Squire#Present status (England)|squirearchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[royal family|royalty]]. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of [[yeoman farmer]]s, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s and [[Catholicism]], as a version of life's generosity; for example [[Alice Meynell|Wilfrid Meynell]] entitled one of his magazines ''Merrie England''. The pastoral aspects of [[William Blake]], a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. [[G. K. Chesterton]] in part adapted it to urban conditions. [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and other left-inclined improvers. [[Walter Crane]]'s "Garland for May Day 1895"  is lettered "Merrie England" together with progressive slogans ("Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life", "The Land for the People", "No Child Toilers") with socialism ("Production for Use Not for Profit"). For a time, the ''Merry England'' vision was a common reference point for rhetorical [[Tories]] and utopian [[socialist]]s, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross [[social inequality]].
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the ''Clarion'', in his booklet ''Merrie England'' (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably {{what?|date=November 2018}} more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. 

Another variant of ''Merry England'' was promoted in the ''organic community'' of [[F. R. Leavis]] by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan R. R. (1979) ''The Literary Criticism if F. R. Leavis'' (Cambridge University Press) pages 14–18, {{ISBN|978-0-521-22324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve "this hard core of Merriment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep England==
"Deep England" refers to an idealised view of a rural, Southern England. The term is neutral, though it reflects what English [[cultural conservative]]s would wish to conserve.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.&lt;ref&gt;D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Little England'' and propaganda==

In Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding "[[Little Englander|Little England]]" during the [[Second World War]] in ''The Myth of the Blitz'', he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime [[propaganda]] operations within the [[United Kingdom]], and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster [[J. B. Priestley]] whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime [[BBC]] radio "chats" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in its [[London Underground|Underground]] stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars." (Angus Calder, ''The Myth of the Blitz'', London 1991)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in ''Journey Through England'', Priestley identified himself as a [[Little Englander]] because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song "[[There'll Always Be an England]]" seems to be derived from the same source:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a country lane,
:Wherever there's a cottage small
:Beside a field of grain.

The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a busy street,
:Wherever there's a turning wheel,
:A million marching feet.

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

Some of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalism]] which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology.  However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of ''Merry England'' to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet [[William Blake]] to the evangelical Christian [[Arthur Mee]]. The [[Rudyard Kipling]] of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. The 1890 [[News from Nowhere]] by [[William Morris]] portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Betjeman]] (more interested in [[Victoriana]]), and the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whose [[hobbit]] characters' culture in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]", [[Michael Moorcock]] opined:

{{quote|The little hills and woods of that [[Surrey]] of the mind, [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], are 'safe', but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond the Shire are 'dangerous'. Experience of life itself is dangerous. The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a declining nation with a [[morally bankrupt]] class whose cowardly self-protection is primarily responsible for the problems England answered with the ruthless logic of [[Thatcherism]]. Humanity was derided and marginalised. Sentimentality became the acceptable substitute. So few people seem to be able to tell the difference.}}

Here the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region within [[Middle-earth]], but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', both [[Gandalf]] and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in ''Concerning Hobbits'' the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness.  Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Furthermore, in the chapters "Homeward Bound" and "The Scouring of the Shire" of Tolkien's "The Return of the King" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as "This is worse than Mordor." Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where "The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture."

''[[The Pyrates]]'', the 1983 spoof historical novel by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]]:
{{quote|It began in the old and golden days of England, in a time when all the hedgerows were green and the roads dusty, when hawthorn and wild roses bloomed, when big-bellied landlords brewed October ale at a penny a pint ...}}

The novel ''[[England, England]]'' by [[Julian Barnes]] describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England.  The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's "Merrie England" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; [[The Kinks]] and their leader [[Ray Davies]] crafted ''[[The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as an album "lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions";&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11011|pure_url=yes}} ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'']. Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' also contains similar elements. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs ([[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the band's namesake]] was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' is a [[comic opera]] by [[Edward German]].

[[Richmal Crompton]]'s "William the Bad'" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch',  about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at "the morning of the world", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal.  The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say,  on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. "The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves [[St. George and the Dragon]] ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwilliamnotes.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Just William|author=Pip|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Day of Listening''' is an [[List of unofficial observances by date|unofficial day of observance]] where Americans are encouraged to set aside time to record the stories of their families, friends, and local communities. It was first launched by the national oral history project [[StoryCorps]] in 2008 and now recurs on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving Day]], when families are more likely to spend time together. It was proposed as an alternative to "[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]", a day many businesses see as a high volume pre-Christmas sale day.

Tens of thousands of Americans interviewed one another as part of the National Day of Listening in 2008 [http://www.storycorps.org/national-day-of-listening/press], including President [[George W. Bush]] and his wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]], who were interviewed by President Bush's sister [[Dorothy Bush Koch]].[https://www.npr.org/about/press/2008/112408.NationalDayListening.html][https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081128.html] National Public Radio personalities including [[Scott Simon]], [[Liane Hansen]], [[Steve Inskeep]], [[Renée Montagne]], [[Frank Deford]], [[Susan Stamberg]], and [[Noah Adams]] also conducted National Day of Listening interviews and broadcast them on the air. [https://www.npr.org/multimedia/2008/11/ndol/ndol.html][http://www.radioworld.com/article/70596][http://www.kgou.org/newsletter_nov08vol1.php]

There are no restrictions on who may conduct an interview as part of the National Day of Listening or what type of interview format may be used. [[StoryCorps]] provides [http://www.storycorps.org/diy/ Do-It-Yourself Resources] and [http://www.storycorps.org/national-day-of-listening/equipment-recommendations equipment recommendations] to guide people through the interview process. guides are available to help teachers and librarians to incorporate The National Day of Listening into the classroom and library.

[[StoryCorps]] is a national nonprofit organization modeled after the [[Federal Writers' Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] of the 1930s.[http://www.newsweek.com/id/183675/page/1] In addition to collecting and archiving interviews at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Library of Congress, StoryCorps helps Americans engage with [[oral history|oral histories]] at the grassroots level. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-27-oralhistory_N.htm]

[[StoryCorps]]' first book, ''Listening Is an Act of Love: A Celebration of American Life from the StoryCorps Project'', was released in 2007.

[[File:SlaterMill.JPG|thumb|right|[[Slater Mill Historic Site|Old Slater Mill]], a historic district in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], was the first property listed in the National Register, on November 13, 1966.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''National Register of Historic Places''' ('''NRHP''') is the [[United States federal government]]'s official [[United States National Register of Historic Places listings|list]] of [[Historic districts in the United States|district]]s, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property.

The passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it. Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually. The remainder are [[contributing property|contributing resources]] within [[historic district (United States)|historic districts]].

For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), an agency within the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.

Occasionally, historic sites outside the country proper, but associated with the United States (such as the [[American Legation, Tangier|American Embassy in Tangiers]]) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts, and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building, or object. '''National Register Historic Districts''' are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include [[National Historic Landmark]]s (NHL), [[National Historic Site (United States)|National Historic Site]]s (NHS), [[National Historic Site (United States)|National Historical Park]]s, [[National Military Park]]s, [[List of National Memorials of the United States|National Memorial]]s, and some [[National Monument (United States)|National Monuments]]. (Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the [[Antiquities Act]] because of either their historical or natural significance. They are managed by multiple agencies. Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register.)

The first official [[Keeper of the Register]] was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory/&gt; During the Register's earliest years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed, and underfunded.&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt; However, funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching [[grants-in-aid]] to listed property owners, first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well.&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

A few years later in 1979, the NPS history programs affiliated with both the [[United States National Park|U.S. National Parks]] system and the National Register were categorized formally into two "Assistant Directorates." Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation.&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt; From 1978 until 1981, the main agency for the National Register was the [[Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service]] (HCRS) of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=hert&gt;Hertfelder, Eric.

In February 1983, the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize the interdependency of their programs. Jerry L. Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate. He was described as a skilled administrator, who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs, academia, and local governments.&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt;

Although not described in detail in the 1966 act, SHPOs eventually became integral to the process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt; Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register, known as Traditional Cultural Properties: those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;

The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its legislative origins in 1966. In 1986, citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites, and districts for inclusion on the National Register, a total of 75,000 separate properties.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt; Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually.

{{rquote|right|It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites.&lt;ref name="DOT"&gt;"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_DOTAct.pdf Department of Transportation Act]", ([[PDF]]), National Park Service, Official site. Retrieved March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;| (49 [[U.S. Code|USC]] 303)}} Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination, although historians and [[historic preservation]] consultants often are employed for this work. The nomination consists of a standard nomination form and contains basic information about a property's physical appearance and the type of significance embodied in the building, structure, object, site, or district.&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt; The State Historic Preservation Office receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group. After preliminary review, the SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission, which then recommends whether the [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the nomination is sent to the National Park Service, which approves or denies the nomination. If approved, the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt; Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state's historic review commission. If an owner objects to a nomination of private property, or in the case of a historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

Retrieved April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For a property to be eligible for the National Register, it must meet at least one of the four National Register main criteria.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb15/nrb15.pdf How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation]," ([[PDF]]), National Register Bulletins, ''National Park Service''. Retrieved March 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Information about [[architectural style]]s, association with various aspects of [[social history]] and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.

* '''Criterion A''', "Event," the property must make a contribution to the major pattern of [[History of the United States|American history]].
* '''Criterion B''', "Person," is associated with significant people of the American past.
* '''Criterion C''', "Design/Construction," concerns the distinctive characteristics of the building by its architecture and construction, including having great artistic value or being the work of a master.
* '''Criterion D''', "Information potential," is satisfied if the property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to prehistory or history.&lt;ref name=criteria&gt;"[https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb15/INDEX.htm Criteria Bulletin]," ''National Register of Historic Places'', Official site. Retrieved March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
The criteria are applied differently for different types of properties; for instance, maritime properties have application guidelines different from those of buildings.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

===Exclusions===
There are specific instances where properties usually do not merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties that have achieved significance during the last fifty years are not qualified for listing on the Register.&lt;ref name=criteria/&gt; There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified in one of those groups to be included.&lt;ref name=criteria/&gt;

A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district, site, building, or property.

Listing in the National Register does not restrict private property owners from the use of their property.&lt;ref name=listing&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215162315/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/results.htm#results|archivedate=February 15, 2008|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/national_register_fundamentals.htm#results|title=What are the results of a listing?|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=August 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states and municipalities, however, may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register. If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is invoked. Section 106 requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources.&lt;ref name=act/&gt; Statutorily, the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP) has the most significant role by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, must first report to the Advisory Council. The director of said agency is required to "take into account the effect of the undertaking" on the National Register property, as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment.&lt;ref name=gray&gt;Gray, Oscar S. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1191055 The Response of Federal Legislation to Historic Preservation]," ([[JSTOR]]), ''Law and Contemporary Problems'', Vol. 36, No. 3, Historic Preservation.

While Section 106 does not mandate explicitly that any federal agency director accept the advice of the ACHP, their advice has practical influence, especially given the statutory obligations of the NHPA that require federal agencies to "take into account the effect of the undertaking."&lt;ref name=act/&gt;&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

In cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an "adverse effect" on historic properties, mitigation is sought. Typically, a [[Memorandum of Agreement]] (MOA) is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan. Many states have laws similar to Section 106.&lt;ref name=achp2&gt;"[http://www.achp.gov/106summary.html Section 106 Summary]," ''Advisory Council on Historic Preservation'', Official site, April 26, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district, municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties. Thus, they may protect the property more than a National Register listing does.&lt;ref name=nps&gt;"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts], [[National Park Service]]. Retrieved March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Title 49 of the United States Code|Department of Transportation Act]], passed on October 15, 1966, the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act, included provisions that addressed historic preservation. The DOT Act is much more general than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register.&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

The more general language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as [[protected area]]s by this legislation, a policy developed early in its history. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1971 case ''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe]]'' that parklands could have the same protected status as "historic sites."&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

A Multiple Property Submission (MPS) is a thematic group listing of the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties to be included in the National Register.

The process begins with the Multiple Property Documentation Form, which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the Multiple Property Documentation Form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time.

The nomination of individual properties in an MPS is accomplished in the same manner as other nominations. The name of the "thematic group" denotes the historical theme of the properties. It is considered the "multiple property listing." Once an individual property or a group of properties is nominated and listed in the National Register, the Multiple Property Documentation Form, combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places Nomination Forms, constitute a Multiple Property Submission.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;Lee, Antoinette J. and McClelland Linda F.

Before the term "Multiple Property Submission" was introduced in 1984, such listings were known as "Thematic Resources", such as the [[Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource (New Jersey)|Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource]], or "Multiple Resource Areas."&lt;ref name=nrhpmps&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/research/data_downloads/Multiples_June2014.xlsx |title=National Register of Historic Places:  Multiple Property Covers as of 06/01/2014 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of properties==

Listed properties are generally in one of five broad categories, although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in any one, or into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for National Register properties are: building, structure, site, district, and object.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt; In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties.

Buildings, as defined by the National Register, are distinguished in the traditional sense. Examples include a house, barn, hotel, church, or similar construction. They are created primarily to shelter human activity. The term building, as in outbuilding, can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units, such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

Structures differ from buildings in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity. Examples include an aircraft, a [[grain elevator]], a [[gazebo]], and a bridge.

Objects are usually artistic in nature, or small in scale compared to structures and buildings. Although objects may be movable, they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment. Examples of objects include monuments, sculptures, and fountains.

Sites are the locations of significant events, which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities or buildings (standing, ruined, or vanished).  When sites are listed, it is the locations themselves that are of historical interest. They possess cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures that currently exist at the locations. Examples of types of sites include [[shipwreck]]s, battlefields, [[campsite]]s, natural features, and [[rock shelter]]s.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

Historic districts possess a concentration, association, or continuity of the other four types of properties. Objects, structures, buildings, and sites in a historic district are united historically or aesthetically, either by choice or by the nature of their development.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

There are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of different types of properties.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt; Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, [[Property type (National Register of Historic Places)#Cultural landscapes|historic designed landscape]]s, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, [[Property type (National Register of Historic Places)#Traditional cultural properties|traditional cultural properties]], and vessels and shipwrecks.&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt;

==Property owner incentives==
[[File:McCranie Turpentine Still historical marker, Willacoochee, GA, USA.JPG|right|thumb|NRHP marker]]
Properties are not protected in any strict sense by the Federal listing. States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect listed historic places. Indirect protection is possible, by state and local regulations on development of National Register properties, and by tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, the state of Colorado, for example, does not set any limits on owners of National Register properties. See [http://coloradohistory-oahp.org/programareas/register/registers.htm "National and state registers", at Colorado Office of Archeology &amp; Historic Preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1976, federal [[tax incentive]]s were virtually non-existent for buildings on the National Register. Before 1976 the federal [[tax code]] favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures.&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt; In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rehabiliation Standards and Guidelines—Technical Preservation Services, National Park Service | website=NPS.gov Homepage (U.S. National Park Service) | url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/rehabilitation.htm | access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Properties and sites listed in the Register, as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;

Owners of income-producing properties listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or of properties that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may be eligible for a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals.&lt;ref name=listing /&gt; The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref name=tps1&gt;"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/tax/index.htm Historic Preservation Tax Incentives]," Technical Preservation Services, ''National Park Service'', Official site. Retrieved March 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the 20% [[tax credit]], the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.&lt;ref name=tps2&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/tax/brochure1.htm About the Historic Preservation Tax Incentives], Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives, Technical Preservation Services, ''National Park Service'', Official site. Retrieved March 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some property owners may also qualify for grants, like the now-defunct [[Save America's Treasures]] grants, which apply specifically to properties entered in the Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks.&lt;ref name=grants1&gt;"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/treasures/faqs.htm#2 Save America's Treasurers: FAQ]" National Park Service.

The NHPA did not distinguish between properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants. This was deliberate, as the authors of the act had learned from experience that distinguishing between categories of significance for such incentives caused the lowest category to become expendable.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory /&gt; Essentially, this made the Landmarks a kind of "honor roll" of the most significant properties of the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nhlhistory" /&gt;

==Recent past==
[[File:The Plaque at the Palace Amusements.jpg|thumb|The plaque at the [[Palace Amusements]] in Asbury Park, NJ (demolished 2004)]]

In American [[historic preservation]], the '''fifty-year rule''' is the generally held belief that a property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places unless it is at least fifty years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/50_year_rule_history.pdf Of Exceptional Importance: The Origins of the Fifty-Year-Rule in Historic Preservation.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, this rule is not a hard rule at all; it is an exception to the National Register's criteria for evaluation. As stated by John H. Sprinkle, Jr., Deputy Director of the Federal Preservation Institute, "this 'rule' is only an exception to the criteria that shape listings within the National Register of Historic Places. Of the eight 'exceptions' [or criteria considerations], Consideration G, for properties that have achieved significance within the past fifty years, is probably the best-known, yet also misunderstood preservation principle in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John H., Jr |last=Sprinkle |title="Of Exceptional Importance": The Origins of the "Fifty-Year Rule" in Historic Preservation |journal=The Public Historian |volume=29 |date=Spring 2007 |pages=81–103 |doi=10.1525/tph.2007.29.2.81 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With each passing year, a new group of resources crosses the fifty-year threshold, that were before considered "too recent" for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (unless they were exceptionally significant). The preservation of these "underage" resources has gained increasing attention in recent years.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny''''' is a 1999 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author argues that [[biological evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]] are shaped and directed first and foremost by "non-zero-sumness" [[i.e.]], the prospect of creating new interactions that are not [[zero-sum]].&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-01/&gt;

== Thesis ==
The principal argument of ''Nonzero'' is to demonstrate that natural selection results in increasing complexity within the world and greater rewards for cooperation.  Since, as Wright puts it, the realization of such prospects is dependent upon increased levels of [[globalization]], communication, cooperation, and trust, what is thought of as human intelligence is really just a long step in an evolutionary process of organisms (as well as their networks and individual parts) getting better at processing information.&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-01/&gt;

Through this lens, and an overview of human and global history, Wright typifies the argument against the views of noted paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]].  Gould wrote that "Humans are here by the luck of the draw."  Wright acknowledges one aspect of Gould's argument—that the evolutionary process was not such that it would inevitably create humans as we know them today ("five fingers, five toes, and so on") but that evolution would almost certainly result in the creation of highly intelligent, communicating organisms, who would in turn develop tools and advanced technologies.

Evidence for natural selection driving improvements in information processing is given throughout, including the case of the [[bombardier beetle]], an insect that developed the ability to spray its attackers with harsh chemicals.  This, in turn, favored predators via natural selection who had techniques to avoid the spray.  As Wright puts it, "complexity breeds complexity."  This is the often referred to evolutionary phenomenon of the "[[Evolutionary_arms_race|arms race]]," wherein competing organisms stack up their developments in competition with one another.

Via this increasing complexity, according to ''Nonzero'', higher intelligence was thus destined to happen, perhaps even "inevitable" (see discussion of inevitability below).  Though the stated thesis is that evolution is headed in the direction of "non-zero-sumness," Wright argues that the realization of such prospects is dependent upon improvements in information processing, thus neatly carving out a reason for the creation and cultural evolution of the human species.

== Complexity and zero-sum solutions in human society ==
Wright argues that as complexity in human society increases, the ability to reap "non-zero-sum gains" increases.  For example, electronic communications enable trade at a global level, and allow various societies to trade in items they could not produce or obtain otherwise, resulting in benefits for everyone: new goods.  Similarly, global governments allow global solutions to common problems.  Were aliens to attack, or the Arctic glaciers to melt, the world would be able to use its communicative technologies to band societies together and defend itself at large.  In fact, this view of the world as an organic entity itself is touched upon in the penultimate chapter of the book, and is similar to that of [[Gaia theory]].

Of course, when societies band together to fight a common enemy, that enemy is not always an Arctic glacier, but rather, other human societies.  Wright discusses this as well, arguing that war between nations often resulted in technological and cultural evolution.  For example, [[World War II]] spurred the development of the [[Manhattan Project]] and, in turn, [[nuclear power]] and related research—a technology that may ultimately benefit the world at large.  Further, societies with advanced governments were more likely to succeed in war, spreading government systems as a technology in and of itself.

== Structure ==
The book is composed in three sections, each one more or less independent, but contributing to the development of his overall thesis.

=== Part I: A brief history of Humankind ===
This section is a sound summary of human cultural development, fairly conventional, except for his references to game theory and the occasional interjection of metaphysical speculation.

=== Part II: A brief history of Organic Life ===
This section is again a broadly conventional overview of current understanding of the development of life on earth. He argues from game-theory that increasing complexity is inevitably going to result from the operation of evolution by natural selection.  More controversially, he argues that intelligence, social co-operation and cultural development are also bound to emerge sooner or later.

=== Part III: From Here to Eternity ===
This brief section is the most controversial part of the book, which he admits is speculative and presents with a degree of humility.  The main thrust of his argument is that we may be on the threshold of a new phase of development involving the creation of a unified global consciousness, along the lines suggested in the writings of Jesuit [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

== Corollaries and criticism ==
Even the development of weapons systems themselves (and Wright's discussion of their increasing complexity over time) left him open to criticism, put into words by [[Steven Pinker]], a linguist/cognitive scientist specializing in [[evolutionary psychology]]:

:"Natural selection has the "goal" of enhancing replication, period. An increase in complexity and cooperation is just one of many subgoals that help organisms attain that ultimate goal. Other subgoals include increases in size, speed, [[motor coordination]], weaponry, energy efficiency, perceptual acuity, parental care, and so on. All have increased over evolutionary time, but none is the "natural end" of the evolutionary process. Would anyone single out lethal weaponry as "highly likely" or our "destiny," just because weapons have become more lethal over organic and human history?"  -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

Similarly, the idea of greater and greater non-zero-sum gains benefitting the world at large is also debated, as such technologies allow the injury of ever larger numbers of people.  While Wright believes that the goal of natural selection is increasing non-zero-sum gains, it is also clear that these gains might not benefit everyone.  Though this does not in any way invalidate Wright's thesis, it does dampen the optimism Wright appears to hold for non-zero-sum dynamics.  Indeed, in a world of separated, village-like units, atrocities within [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union or [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]] could not have occurred.  (Of course, life within those village-like units had its own inherent problems, and the question of which point in history was better is addressed by arguments within [[teleology]]—whether history has a direction, and thus if history has shown consistent progress.)  Wright believes that overall there has been net progress (with some exceptions), and further, that this progress will continue.  In response to Wright's assumption that cooperation and communication will continue to increase, Pinker writes:

:"...global cooperation and moral progress will not increase toward some theoretical maximum or Teilhardesque [[Omega Point]], but will level off at a point where the pleasures resulting from global cooperation (having more stuff than you had before) are balanced by the pleasures resulting from non-cooperation (having more stuff than your neighbors, or the warm glow of ethnic chauvinism)." -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

Pinker also challenges Wright's core thesis, echoing the case made by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], that human-like organisms are no more than a coincidence:

:"A species with humanlike intelligence was no more "in the cards" than a species with an elephantlike trunk--both are just handy biological gadgets. (Of course, given enough time, humanlike intelligence is near-certain to evolve; but given enough time, anything with nonzero probability is near-certain to evolve, including an elephantlike trunk.) A brain with the intelligence necessary for cooperation and specialization is metabolically expensive and biomechanically hazardous, and evolves only when the evolutionary precursor and current ecosystem make the benefits exceed the costs. Most lineages (e.g., of plants) never got smart, and all lineages of animals on earth except ours were stuck well beneath the subgenius level." -[[Steven Pinker]], from [http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com].

== Wright's response to criticism ==
Wright acknowledges several of these criticisms within ''Nonzero'' itself and in turn responds with his purpose in writing the book—that by acknowledging options to reap non-zero-sum gains, societies might work to decrease zero-sum losses, like the loss of resources used in the pursuit of armed conflict.

In response to Pinker's comments regarding the inevitability of human-like intelligence (as versus to the elephant trunk), Wright replies:

{{quote|A human level of intelligence--unlike an elephant's trunk--is a key step in [the march of evolution], for it gives rise to a rapid and powerful kind of cultural evolution, an evolution that increasingly, in a sense, takes on a life of its own, and has gotten us from the stone age to now... The modern world, it seems to me, features a second kind of validation of my emphasis on the biological evolution of intelligence, and my insistence that biological and cultural evolution have important parallels. A number of observers have noted that the Internet (defined broadly, to include the people who communicate over it) strikingly resembles a giant global brain. No one has claimed that it resembles a giant elephant's trunk.|[[Robert Wright (journalist)]]|[http://www.slate.com/id/2000143/entry/1004510/ Nonzero, Slate.com]}}

There is also question of whether non-zero-sum gains will&amp;mdash;or even should&amp;mdash;benefit all members of society under any system of [[egalitarianism]].  Wright does argue that increased levels of communication will inevitably lead to a decrease in enmity between some populations.  Still, this does not answer the question of whether some members of society will ever "catch-up" in terms of technological connectedness, or if some might be barred entirely by some kind of oppressive (but still productive) political system.  Wright states on p.&amp;nbsp;329 of ''Nonzero'' (Vintage Paperback edition) that "one can well imagine, as the Internet nurtures more and more communities of interest, true friendships more and more crossing the most dangerous fault lines&amp;mdash;boundaries of religion, of nationality, of ethnicity, of culture."  Wright then states in his endnote to the section, "a big question is whether boundaries of social class will be so easily crossed &amp;mdash; or whether, on the other hand, differences of social class within a society might sharpen as people invest more of their energy in virtual communities consisting of like-minded people."

Though Wright clearly does not posit an answer to the question of struggles among economic classes&amp;mdash;whether they be because of or in spite of natural selection&amp;mdash;some argue it is relevant to Wright's treatment of evolution as resulting in greater and greater moral progress, and thus strangely ignored, given that Wright is the author of another book examining human morality ''[[The Moral Animal]]''.

== Wright and creationists ==
Wright argues for the possibility of divine purpose (and thus for the concept of [[God]] as a creating entity) but is against [[creationism]], and theories on [[intelligent design]]. He argued against the concepts in articles related to ''Nonzero''.

Like most biologists, Wright firmly rejects the notion of divine biological manipulation.  But Wright does leave open the possibility of divine intervention in the case of human consciousness, which he does not see as being easily explained by natural selection. [[Consciousness]]&amp;mdash;humans' ability to ponder their own existence&amp;mdash;seems a strange outgrowth of the evolutionary process for Wright. He describes the alternative as humans that are devoid of consciousness and behave like [[Philosophical zombie|zombies]] that form romantic relationships, eat, sleep, and have discussions only because they are programmed to via cultural and genetic transmission.

Wright argues that consciousness is still a mystery in terms of evolutionary purpose, and leaves open the possibility that a divine entity introduced the phenomenon of consciousness. Wright also debates whether or not entities aside from humans possess consciousness. Wright does not explain how a biological entity could evolve a level of intelligence like that existing in humans without the intelligence inherently including consciousness.&lt;ref name=NZ-B-H-02/&gt;

Wright also briefly questions the possibilities regarding what created natural selection, but Wright himself refers to his comments as highly speculative.

Wright's idea of ''[[divinity]]'' is further explored in his follow-up book, ''The Evolution of God''.  He does not argue that an intelligent being is behind it all, but that the existence of a process that could be called ''divine'' is suggested, much the way the existence of electrons is suggested by the inner workings of a computer (despite no one ever seeing one).

Despite this dramatic paradigm shift among professional historians, the decline thesis continues to maintain a strong presence in [[popular history]], as well as academic history written by scholars who are not specialists on the Ottoman Empire. In some cases this is due to the continued reliance by non-specialists on outdated and debunked works,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=457 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7 |quote=In the scholarly literature produced by Ottomanists since the mid-1970s, the hitherto prevailing view of Ottoman decline has been effectively debunked.

Historians in adjacent fields have tended to rely on earlier classics and later uninformed surveys which perpetuate older, now deconstructed, views.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others to certain political interests benefiting from the continued perpetuation of the decline narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Sajdi refers on the one hand to nationalists in post-Ottoman regions of the world, and on the other, to the supporters of imperialistic intervention in the Middle East among some politicians in the West. {{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B.

The idea of decline first emerged among the Ottomans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning much earlier, but greatly expanding during the seventeenth century, was the literary genre of [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]], or "Advice for Kings."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Genre and Myth," pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; This genre had a long history, appearing in earlier Muslim empires such as those of the [[Seljuks]] and [[Abbasids]]. Nasihatname literature was primarily concerned with order and disorder in state and society; it conceptualized the ruler as the embodiment of justice, whose duty it was to ensure that his subjects would receive that justice. This was often expressed through the concept of the Circle of Justice ({{lang-ota|dāʾire-i ʿadlīye|script=Latn}}). In this conception, the provision of justice by the ruler to his subjects would allow those subjects to prosper, strengthening the ruler in turn.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Should this break down, society would cease to properly function. Thus many Ottomans writing in this genre, such as [[Mustafa Âlî]],&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Fleischer. ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual in the Ottoman Empire: The Historian Mustafa Âli, 1541–1600'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; described the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] as the most perfect manifestation of this system of justice, and put forth the idea that the empire had since declined from that golden standard. These writers viewed the changes which the empire had undergone as an inherently negative corruption of an idealized Suleimanic past. However, it is now recognized that rather than simply describing objective reality, they were often utilizing the genre of decline to voice their own personal complaints. For instance, Mustafa Âli's belief that the empire was declining was in large part motivated by frustration at his own failure to achieve promotions and court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the nasihatname writers, then, may have simply been to protect their own personal or class status in a rapidly changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography and the Literature of 'Decline' of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century," ''Journal of Asian History'' 22 (1988), pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 20–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Western Europe ===
The notion of an all-encompassing Ottoman decline did not enter Western historiography until the early nineteenth century, with the works of historians such as [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, ''Geschichte des Osmanisches Reiches'', (in German) 10 vols. (Budapest: Ca. H. Hartleben, 1827–35).&lt;/ref&gt; who knew [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and adopted the idea directly from Ottoman nasihatname writers. Internal decline was thus thought of as an appropriate means of explaining the Ottomans' external military defeats, and acted also as a justification for European [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a declining Ottoman/Islamic civilization was thus used as a foil for [[Western Civilization]], in which the "decadent" Ottomans were contrasted with the "dynamic" West. Islam (as an all-encompassing civilizational category) often came to be portrayed as the polar opposite of the West, whereby Western societies valued freedom, rationality, and progress while Islam valued servility, superstition, and stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=62-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions were perpetuated in the mid-twentieth century above all by the works of [[H.A.R. Gibb]] and Harold Bowen, and [[Bernard Lewis]], who adhered to a civilizational conception of Islamic decline while modifying it with the new sociological paradigm of [[Modernization Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=104-12, 130-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views came under increasing criticism as historians began to reexamine their own fundamental assumptions about Ottoman and Islamic history, particularly after the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Ottoman Advice for Kings," pp. 143–44; Edward Said, ''Orientalism'', (New York: Pantheon, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The thesis' tenets ==
[[File:Bernard Lewis in 2012 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Bernard Lewis]], one of the decline thesis' most famous proponents.]]

The most prominent writer on Ottoman decline was the historian [[Bernard Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that the Ottoman Empire experienced all-encompassing decline affecting government, society and civilization. He laid out his views in the 1958 article, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire," ''Studia Islamica'' 1 (1958) 111–127.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed into the mainstream opinion of [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] scholars of the mid-twentieth century. However, the article is now highly criticized and no longer considered accurate by modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', 242n.
* Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization."
* Darling, "Another Look at Periodization."
* Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing."
* Suraiya Faroqhi, ''Approaching Ottoman History: An Introduction to the Sources'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' views were as follows:

The first ten sultans of the Ottoman Empire (from [[Osman I]] to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]) were of excellent personal quality, while those who came after Suleiman were without exception "incompetents, degenerates, and misfits," a result of the [[Kafes]] system of succession, whereby dynastic princes no longer gained experience in provincial government before coming to the throne. Faulty leadership at the top led to decay in all branches of government: the bureaucracy ceased to function effectively, and the quality of their records worsened. The Ottoman military lost its strength and began to experience defeats on the battlefield. They ceased to keep up with the advances of European military science, and consequently suffered territorial losses. As the Ottoman state and society was geared towards constant expansion, their sudden failure to achieve new conquests left the empire unable to adapt to its new relationship with Europe.

Economically, the empire was undermined by the discovery of the [[New World]] and the subsequent shift in the economic balance between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe, as well as the voyages of discovery which brought Europeans to India, and led to a decline in the volume of trade passing through Ottoman ports. In addition, the [[Price Revolution]] led to the destabilization of Ottoman coinage and a severe fiscal crisis, which proved disastrous when paired with the rapidly rising costs of warfare. As the cavalry army of the Ottomans became obsolete, the [[Timar]] System of land tenure which had sustained it fell into obsolescence, while the corrupt bureaucracy was unable to replace it with a functional alternative. Instead, tax-farming was introduced, leading to corruption and oppression of the peasantry, and agricultural decline. Ottoman economic and military backwardness was extenuated by their closed-mindedness and unwillingness to adopt European innovations, as well as an increasing disdain for practical science. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire "reverted to a medieval state, with a medieval mentality and a medieval economy – but with the added burden of a bureaucracy and a standing army which no medieval state had ever had to bear."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," pp. 112–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, explanations of Ottoman decline were not limited to the empire's geopolitical position among world empires or to its military strength. The decline thesis was rooted in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conception of distinct "civilizations" as units of historical analysis, and thus explained Ottoman weakness with reference not only to its geopolitics but also defined it in social, economic, cultural, and moral terms. This all-encompassing notion of the decline of Ottoman (and more widely, Islamic) civilization became the framework within which Ottoman history from the sixteenth century onward was understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Decline Thesis ==
===Conceptual issues===
Dana Sajdi, in an article summarizing the critiques of the decline thesis written since the 1970s, identifies the following as the main points that scholars have demonstrated: "1. The changing nature and adaptability of Ottoman state and society; 2. indigenous or internal social, economic, and/or intellectual processes displaying signs of modernity prior to the advent of the West; 3. the comparability of Ottoman state and society with their counterparts in the world in the same period; and 4. a logic, or a framework, alternative to decline and the Eurocentrism implied therein, that takes into account the phenomena of the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two points pertain to the decline thesis' depiction of Ottoman state and society as being backward-looking, static, and essentially incapable of innovation prior to the 'impact of the West'; the third concerns the degree to which the Ottoman Empire was taken to be totally unique, operating according to its own rules and internal logic, rather than being integrated into a wider comparative framework of world history; while the fourth addresses the degree to which the decline thesis overlooked the local processes actually occurring in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in favor of emphasis on the grand narrative of Ottoman decay and European superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with these points, a common criticism of the decline thesis is that it is teleological: that is to say that it presents all of Ottoman history as the story of the rise and fall of the empire, causing earlier historians to over-emphasize the empire's troubles and under-emphasize its strengths. According to Linda Darling, "because we know that eventually the Ottomans became a weaker power and finally disappeared, every earlier difficulty they experienced becomes a "seed of decline," and Ottoman successes and sources of strength vanish from the record."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The corollary of decline is the notion that the empire had earlier reached a peak, and this too has been problematized. The reign of Suleiman the Magnificent had been seen as a golden age to which all of the rest of the empire's history was to be compared. Such comparisons caused earlier researchers to see transformation and change as inherently negative, as the empire shifted away from the established norms of Suleiman's romanticized and idealized age. According to Jane Hathaway, this focus on the "golden age" had a distorting effect on its history: "a massive empire that lasted for over six centuries cannot have had an ideal moment and an ideal permutation by which the entire chronological and geographical span of the empire can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, modern scholars take change to be a natural result of the empire's adaptation to the world around it, a sign of innovativeness and flexibility rather than decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=457 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
In reexamining the notion of political decline in the Ottoman Empire, historians first examined the [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]] texts which had formed the backbone of the decline thesis. Many scholars, among them most notably Douglas Howard&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography," pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rifa'at Ali Abou-El-Haj,&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that these Ottoman writers' critiques of contemporary society were not uninfluenced by their own biases, and criticized earlier historians for taking them at face value without any critical analysis. Furthermore, "complaint about the times" was in fact a literary trope in Ottoman society, and also existed during the period of the so-called "golden age" of Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age: Ottoman Historical Consciousness in the post-Süleymanic Era," in ''Süleyman the Second [sic] and His Time'', eds. Halil İnalcık and Cemal Kafadar (Istanbul: ISIS Press, 1993), pp. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For Ottoman writers, "decline" was a trope which allowed them to pass judgement on the contemporary state and society, rather than a description of objective reality. Thus, these works should not be taken as evidence of actual Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, "The Veliyüddin Telhis: Notes on the Sources and Interrelations between Koçu Bey and Contemporary Writers of Advice to Kings," ''Belleten'' 43 (1979), pp. 547–571.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pál Fodor, "State and Society, Crisis and Reform, in a 15th–17th Century Ottoman Mirror for Princes," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 40 (1986), pp. 217–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tropes of political decline, such as the notion that the sultans ruling after the time of Suleiman I were less competent rulers, have also been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, "Introduction to Part I," 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigns of such figures as [[Ahmed I]],&lt;ref&gt;Börekçi, "Factions and Favorites."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osman II]],&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mehmed IV]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Baer, ''Honored by the Glory of Islam: Conversion and Conquest in Ottoman Europe'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) have been re-examined in the context of the conditions of their own respective eras, rather than by inappropriately comparing them with a mythical Suleimanic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the very notion of whether Suleiman's reign constituted a golden age in the first place has come into question.&lt;ref name=mythgoldenage&gt;Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age", 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaya Şahin, ''Empire and Power in the Reign of Süleyman: Narrating the Sixteenth-Century Ottoman World'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that sultans no longer personally accompanied the army on military campaigns is no longer criticized, but seen as a positive and necessary change resulting from the empire's transformation into a sedentary imperial polity.&lt;ref&gt;Hakan T. Karateke, "On the Tranquility and Repose of the Sultan," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 116.
* Leslie Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire'', (Oxford University Press: 1993), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Peirce's research on the political role of women in the Ottoman dynasty has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the assumption that the so-called [[Sultanate of Women]], in which female members of the dynasty exercised an unusually high degree of power, was in some way either a cause or a symptom of imperial weakness. On the contrary, Ottoman [[Valide Sultan]]s, princesses, and concubines were successfully able to fortify dynastic rule during periods of instability, and played an important role in dynastic legitimization.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem'', pp. 267–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the importance of the rapidly expanding bureaucracy is now particularly emphasized as a source of stability and strength for the empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, drawing particularly upon the work of Linda Darling.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 200–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Based largely on the work of Ariel Salzmann, the empowerment of regional notables in the eighteenth century has been reinterpreted as an effective form of government, rather than a sign of decline.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing", 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=393–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
One of the most enduring claims of the decline thesis was that of the weakness of the Ottoman military in the post-Suleimanic period. Supposedly, the once-feared [[Janissary]] Corps became corrupted as they increasingly earned privileges for themselves, gaining the right to marry, sire children, and enroll those children into the corps. Rather than maintaining strict military discipline, they began to take up professions as merchants and shopkeepers in order to supplement their income, thus losing their military edge. However, it is now understood that janissary participation in the economy was not limited to the post-Suleimanic period. Janissaries were engaging in commerce as early as the fifteenth century, without any apparent impact on their military discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "On the Purity and Corruption of the Janissaries," ''Turkish Studies Association Bulletin'' 15 (1991): 273–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, far from becoming militarily ineffective, the Janissaries continued to remain one of the most innovative forces in Europe, introducing the tactic of [[volley fire]] alongside and perhaps even earlier than most European armies.&lt;ref&gt;Günhan Börekçi, "A Contribution to the Military Revolution Debate: The Janissaries' Use of Volley Fire During the Long Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593–1606 and the Problem of Origins." ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 59 (2006): 407–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even greater attention has been given to the changes experienced by the [[Timar]] System during this era. The breakdown of the Timar System is now seen not as a result of incompetent administration, but as a conscious policy meant to help the empire adapt to the increasingly monetized economy of the late sixteenth century. Thus, far from being a symptom of decline, this was part of a process of military and fiscal modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, ''The Sultan's Servants: The Transformation of Ottoman Provincial Government, 1550–1650'', (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Salzmann, "The Old Regime and the Ottoman Middle East," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 412.&lt;/ref&gt; The army of cavalry which the Timar System had produced was becoming increasingly obsolete by the seventeenth century, and this transformation allowed the Ottomans to instead raise large armies of musket-wielding infantry, thereby maintaining their military competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Halil İnalcık, "Military and Fiscal Transformation in the Ottoman Empire, 1600–1700," ''Archivum Ottomanicum'' 6 (1980): 283–337.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1690s, the proportion of infantry in the Ottoman army had increased to 50–60 percent, equivalent to their Habsburg rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Firearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European Military Revolution, 1450–1800". ''Journal of World History.' 25 (2014): 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of armament production and weapons technology, the Ottomans remained roughly equivalent with their European rivals throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Grant, "Rethinking the Ottoman "Decline": Military Technology Diffusion in the Ottoman Empire, Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries." ''Journal of World History'' 10 (1999): 179–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Ottoman Artillery and European Military Technology in the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 47/1–2 (1994): 15–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that Ottoman cannon foundries neglected mobile field guns by producing oversized siege cannon at a disproportionate rate has been debunked by the military historian Gábor Ágoston.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 195–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Orientalism|Orientalistic]] claim that an inherent conservatism in [[Islam]] prevented the Ottomans from adopting European military innovations, it is now known that the Ottomans were receptive to foreign techniques and inventions, and continued to employ European renegades and technical experts throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, "Military Transformation," pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 192–195.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of productive capacity, the Ottomans were even able to surpass their European rivals during the seventeenth century. They maintained full self-sufficiency in [[gunpowder]] production until the late eighteenth century, and with rare and brief exceptions were continually able to produce enough [[cannon]] and [[muskets]] to supply their whole armed forces as well as surplus stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gábor Ágoston and Rhoads Murphey, Ottoman defeats in the [[Great Turkish War|1683–99]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|1768–74]] wars with the [[Habsburg Austria|Habsburgs]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] are best explained by the strain on logistics and communications caused by multi-front warfare rather than Ottoman inferiority in technology and armaments, as such inferiority, insofar as it existed at all, was far less significant than had formerly been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, ''Ottoman Warfare: 1500–1700'', (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1999), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed that the Ottoman military was able to maintain rough parity with its rivals until the 1760s, falling behind as a consequence of a long period of peace on its western front between 1740 and 1768, when the Ottomans missed out on the advances associated with the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aksan |first=Virginia |title=Ottoman Wars, 1700–1860: An Empire Besieged |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd. |date=2007 |pages=130–5 |isbn=978-0-582-30807-7}}

=== Economic and fiscal ===
Early critiques of the decline thesis from an economic standpoint were heavily influenced by new sociological perspectives of [[dependency theory]] and [[world-systems analysis]] as articulated by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] in the 1960s and 1970s. These theories provided an influential critique of the prevailing theory of [[modernization theory|modernization]] which was then popular among economists and political analysts, and had been the framework within which Ottoman economic history had been understood, exemplified above all by [[Bernard Lewis]]' 1961 ''The Emergence of Modern Turkey''. Modernization theory held that the underdeveloped world was impoverished because its failure to follow Europe in advancing along a series of distinct stages of development (based on the model provided above all by France and Britain), which were assumed to be uniformly applicable to all societies. Historians seeking to identify the factors which prevented the Ottomans from achieving "modernization" turned to the stereotypes which formed the basis of the decline thesis: an Ottoman penchant for despotism and lethargy which inhibited their entry into the modern world and brought about economic stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, in contrast, viewed modern-day underdevelopment as the product of the unequal global economic system gradually established by Europeans beginning in the early modern period, and thus saw it as the outcome of a historical process rather than a simple inability to adapt on the part of the non-Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=155-9, 169-70 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, introduced into Ottoman history by Huri İslamoğlu-İnan and Çağlar Keyder, thus allowed historians to move beyond the concepts which had previously dominated Ottoman economic history, above all the notion of an "Oriental despotism"{{refn|group=n|"Oriental despotism" was a term deployed in [[Marxist]] historical analyses. It was postulated on a vision of Middle Eastern state and society as one in which all power was concentrated in the hands of an absolute ruler, who by controlling all of the land in the empire, prevented the independent emergence of a native bourgeoisie, and thus made capitalism impossible. This concept, or others like it, long served as a foundational principle in the study of the economic history of the Ottoman Empire and of Asian societies more generally, though it was, as noted by Zachary Lockman, "in reality based on crude generalizations and a very faulty understanding of their [Asian societies'] (quite diverse) histories and social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=83-5 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which supposedly inhibited economic development, and instead to examine the empire in terms of its gradual integration into the periphery of a newly emerging Europe-centered world system. Subsequent provincial studies highlighted the degree to which the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire was undergoing its own capitalist transformation independent of European economic penetration, which in turn facilitated the empire's integration into the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even following the empire's peripheralization, Ottoman manufacturing, long assumed to have collapsed in the face of European competition, is now understood to have grown and even flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting from the strength of the Ottoman domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier periods, Ottoman economic and fiscal downturn was associated above all with the catastrophic effects of the [[price revolution]] of the late sixteenth century. However, this economic downturn was not unique to the Ottomans, but was shared by European states as all struggled with the diverse pressures of inflation, demographic shifts, and the escalating costs of warfare. By placing the Ottomans in comparative context with their neighbors, scholars have demonstrated that the multiple crises experienced by the Ottomans in the late sixteenth and early-to-mid seventeenth centuries can be seen as part of a wider European context characterized as the '[[The General Crisis|general crisis of the seventeenth century]]', rather than a sign of uniquely Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the Ottoman economy was unable to recover from these crises was rooted both in the poor state of the field's knowledge of the Ottoman economy in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and also in how easily it seemed to fit with pre-existing ideas about Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research demonstrated that, in the words of Şevket Pamuk, the eighteenth century "was in fact a period of recovery for the Ottoman monetary system," indicating that "the old thesis of continuous decline cannot be sustained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamuk |first=Şevket |title=A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from declining, the first half of the eighteenth century was a period of significant expansion and growth for the Ottoman economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=402 }}

Other supposed manifestations of Ottoman economic decline have also been challenged. The establishment by European merchants of new maritime trade routes to India around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], bypassing Ottoman territories, had a far less significant impact on the Ottoman economy than had once been assumed. While earlier scholarship depicted the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] as having established a near-monopoly on the movement of luxury goods, particularly spices, to Europe, in fact the Portuguese were only one of many actors competing in the Indian Ocean commercial arena. Even in the late sixteenth century, Asian merchants utilizing the traditional Red Sea trade routes through Ottoman territory transported four times as many spices as those of Portuguese merchants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Levi |author-first= Scott C. |chapter=Objects in Motion |page=331 |title=A Companion to World History |editor=Douglas Northrop |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until the early eighteenth century more silver specie continued to be imported into India via the traditional Middle Eastern routes than through the European-dominated Cape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Prakash |author-first=Om |chapter=Precious-metal Flows into India in the Early Modern Period |editors=Dennis O. Flynn, Arturo Giráldez and Richard von Glahn |title=Global Connections and Monetary History, 1470-1800 |place=Aldershot |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of revenue which did occur was made up for by the rise in the coffee trade from [[Yemen]] during the seventeenth century which, along with strong commercial ties with India, ensured the continued prosperity of Red Sea trade and of Cairo as a commercial center.&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, "Crisis and Change," 507; Jane Hathaway, "The Ottomans and the Yemeni Coffee Trade," ''Oriente Moderno'' 25 (2006): 161–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as the above-mentioned [[Bernard Lewis]] once referred to the supposed fall in the quality of the empire's bureaucratic records as an indication of stagnation in the Ottoman administrative apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians now recognize that no such decline ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 299–306.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in record-keeping was attributable not to loss in quality, but to a change in the nature of land assessment, as the empire adjusted to the increasingly monetized economy characteristic of the seventeenth century. The assessment methods in use under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman]] were well-suited to ensuring proper distribution of revenues to the army of [[timariots|feudal cavalry]] that then made up the bulk of Ottoman forces. However, by the turn of the century, the need for cash to raise armies of [[musketeers|musket-wielding infantry]] led the central government to reform its system of land tenure, and to expand the practice of [[tax farming]], which was also a common method of revenue-raising in contemporary Europe. In fact, the seventeenth century was a period of significant expansion in the Ottoman bureaucracy, not contraction or decline.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 81–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime, c. 1600–1850," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011) 423–434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, contrary to the claims of earlier historians, do not seem to have led to widespread corruption or oppression to a degree greater than that observable among the Ottoman Empire's European contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 246–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans, like other European states, struggled throughout the seventeenth century to meet rapidly rising expenses, but by its end were able to institute reforms which allowed them to enter the eighteenth century with a budget surplus. In the words of Linda Darling, "Ascribing seventeenth-century Ottoman budgetary deficits to the decline of the empire leaves unexplained the cessation of these deficits in the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st-century scholarly consensus ==
{{main|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}
Having dispensed with the notion of decline, today's historians of the Ottoman Empire most commonly refer to the post-Suleimanic Period, or more widely the period from 1550 to 1700, as one of transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, ''Crisis and Change'', 553.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, "Political culture and the great households", in Suraiya Faroqhi eds., ''The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603–1839'', volume 3 of ''The Cambridge History of Turkey''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of economic and political crises in defining this period is crucial, but so too is their temporary nature, as the Ottoman state was ultimately able to survive and adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''Arab Lands'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, "Crisis and Change," 411–414.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of increasing emphasis is the place of the Ottoman Empire in comparative perspective, particularly with the states of Europe. While the Ottomans struggled with a severe economic and fiscal downturn, so too did their European contemporaries. This period is frequently referred to as that of [[the General Crisis|The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]],&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''Global Crisis: War, Climate Change &amp; Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the difficulties faced by the Ottoman Empire have been reframed not as unique to them, but as part of a general trend impacting the entire European and Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime," 423.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Ehud R. Toledano|Ehud Toledano]], "In both Europe and the Ottoman empire, these changes transformed states and the ways in which military-administrative elites waged and funded wars. Coping with these enormous challenges and finding the appropriate responses through a sea of socio-economic and political changes is, in fact, the story of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ottoman history. A remarkable adaptation to new realities, rather than decline and disintegration, was its main feature; it reflects the resourcefulness, pragmatism and flexibility in thought and action of the Ottoman military-administrative elite, rather than their ineptitude or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=459 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, per Dana Sajdi: "Regardless of what one may think of an individual revisionist work, or a particular method or framework, the cumulative effect of the scholarship has demonstrated the empirical and theoretical invalidity of the decline thesis, and offered a portrayal of an internally dynamic Ottoman state and society. It has also established the comparability of the Ottoman empire to other - mainly European - societies and polities, and concomitantly revised the existing scheme of periodization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st-century scholarly consensus on the post-Suleimanic period can thus be summarized as follows:

{{Quote|text=Historians of the Ottoman Empire have rejected the narrative of decline in favor of one of crisis and adaptation: after weathering a wretched economic and demographic crisis in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman Empire adjusted its character from that of a military conquest state to that of a territorially more stable, bureaucratic state whose chief concern was no longer conquering new territories but extracting revenue from the territories it already controlled while shoring up its image as the bastion of Sunni Islam. |author=Jane Hathaway, with contributions by Karl K. Barbir |source=''The Arab Lands Under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1800'', (Pearson Education Limited, 2008), pp. 8–9.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">The '''Pontifical Committee of Historical Sciences''' is a division of the [[Roman Curia]] established on 7 April 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. 

==Background==
Pope Pius XII created this Committee on 7 April 1954 as the successor to the Commission of Cardinals for Historical Studies, which Pope Leo XIII had created on 18 August 1883 with the [[apostolic letter]] ''Saepenumero considerantes''. That commission was created to contribute to the development and proper use of historical sciences, especially late in the nineteenth century when parts of the Vatican's historical records, known as the [[Vatican Secret Archive]], was opened to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=it | website= Pontficio Comitato di Scienze Storiche | title= Profilo storico del Comitato| accessdate=7 April 2018 | url=http://www.historia.va/content/scienzestoriche/it/struttura-del-comitato/profilo-storico.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Committee was created to foster cooperation with the [[International Committee of Historical Sciences]], which was scheduled to hold its convention in Rome in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Otto | editor-first1=Bernd-Christian  | editor-first2= Susanne |editor-last2=Rau |editor-first3= Jörg |editor-last3= Rüpke| title=History and Religion: Narrating a Religious Past|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Berlin/Boston| page=452|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YM55CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;|accessdate=7 April 2018 | first=Giovanni | last= Filoramo | chapter= Locating the history of Christianity between the history of the church and the History of Religions: The Italian case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Committee is charged with promoting the use of ecclesiastical archives for historical research and fostering cooperation with ecclesiastical and extra-ecclesial institutions and associations, particularly at the international level. It sponsors seminars and conferences, both independently and in concert with peer organizations; reviews the historical data presented in the ''[[Pontifical Yearbook]]''; collaborates with multinational scientific initiatives ([[UNESCO]]); and sponsors internships for the study of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

In 2011, the Committee held a conference devoted to St. [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= Catholic News Agency | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/italian-conference-set-to-honor-st.-catherine-of-siena | accessdate = 8 April 2018 | date= 21 October 2011| title = Italian conference set to honor St. Catherine of Siena | first= David |last=Kerr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it marked the 1700th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|Battle of Ponte Milvio]] with a conference called "Constantine the Great.

'''Post-classical history''' (also called the '''Post-Antiquity era''', '''Post-Ancient Era''', or '''Pre-Modern Era''') is a [[periodization]] commonly used by the school of "[[world history]]" instead of [[Middle Ages]] (Medieval), which is roughly synonymous.&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt; The period runs from about AD 500 to 1450 though there may be regional differences and debates. The era was globally characterized by the expansion of civilizations geographically, the development of three of the great world religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism), and development of networks of trade between civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf The Post‐Classical Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031011114/http://www.aasd.k12.wi.us/staff/hermansenjoel/Notes/the%20post%20classical%20era.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }} by Joel Hermansen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weller-stearns" /&gt;

In Asia, the [[spread of Islam]] created a [[Caliphate|new empire]] and [[Islamic Golden Age]] with trade between the [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an continents, and advances in [[science in the medieval Islamic world]]. [[East Asia]] experienced the full establishment of power of [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], which established several prosperous dynasties influencing Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] spread. [[Gunpowder]] was originally developed in China during the post-classical era. The [[Mongol Empire]] connected Europe and Asia creating safe trade and stability between the two regions. In total the [[World population estimates|population of the world]] doubled in the time period from approximately 210 million in AD 500 to 461 million in 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein Goldewijk|first=Kees|last2=Beusen|first2=Arthur|last3=Janssen|first3=Peter|date=2010-03-22|title=Long-term dynamic modeling of global population and built-up area in a spatially explicit way: HYDE 3.1|journal=The Holocene|volume=20|issue=4|pages=565–573|doi=10.1177/0959683609356587|issn=0959-6836|bibcode=2010Holoc..20..565K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population generally grew steadily throughout the period but endured some incidental declines in events including the [[Plague of Justinian]], [[Mongol invasions and conquests|The Mongol Invasions]] and the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name="Haub1650"&gt;Haub (1995): "The average annual rate of growth was actually lower from 1 A.D. to 1650 than the rate suggested above for the 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. period. One reason for this abnormally slow growth was the Black Plague. This dreaded scourge was not limited to 14th century Europe. The epidemic may have begun about 542 A.D. in Western Asia, spreading from there. It is believed that half the Byzantine Empire was destroyed in the 6th century, a total of 100 million deaths."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
===Terminology and periodization===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leonardo Bruni]] was a Renaissance historian who helped develop the concept of the Middle Ages.]]
'Post-classical history' is a [[periodization]] used by historians employing a "[[world history]]" approach to history, specifically the school developed during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns&gt;{{cite book |editor=R. Charles Weller |title=21st-Century Narratives of World History: Global and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |publisher=Palgrave |chapter=Periodization in World History: Challenges and Opportunities |last=Stearns |first=Peter N. |authorlink=Peter N. Stearns |year=2017 |page= |isbn=978-3319620770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of world history, the term is also sometimes used to avoid erroneous pre-conceptions around the terms "Middle Ages", "Medieval" and "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" (see [[medievalism]]).

The post-classical period corresponds roughly to the period from 500 to 1450 CE.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Beginning and ending dates might vary depending on the region, with the period beginning at the end of the previous classical period: [[End of the Han Dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651).

The post-classical period is one of the five or six major periods world historians use: (1) early civilization; (2) [[Ancient history|classical societies]]; (3) post-classical; (4) [[early modern]]; (5) [[long nineteenth century]]; and (6) [[Modern history|contemporary or modern era]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; (Sometimes the nineteenth century and modern are combined.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt;) Although ''post-classical'' is synonymous with the [[Middle Ages]] of Western Europe, the term ''post-classical'' is not necessarily a member of the traditional [[Late Middle Ages#Historiography and periodization|tripartite periodisation]] of Western European history into 'classical', 'middle' and 'modern'.

===Approaches===
The historical field of [[world history]], which looks at common themes occurring across multiple cultures and regions, has enjoyed extensive development since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1–14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, World History research has tended to focus on [[early modern globalization]] (beginning around 1500) and subsequent developments, and views post-classical history as mainly pertaining to [[Afro-Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Historians recognize the difficulties of creating a periodization and identifying common themes that include not only this region but also, for example, the Americas, since they had little contact with Afro-Eurasia before the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; Thus recent research has emphasised that 'a global history of the period between 500 and 1500 is still wanting' and that 'historians have only just begun to embark on a global history of the Middle Ages'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many regions of the world, there are well established histories. Although [[Medieval Studies]] in Europe tended in the nineteenth century to focus on creating histories for individual nation-states, much twentieth-century research focused, successfully, on creating an integrated history of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamicate world likewise has a rich regional historiography, ranging from the fourteenth-century [[Ibn Khaldun]] to the twentieth-century [[Marshall Hodgson]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Silverstein, ''Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 94-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, research into the network of commercial hubs which enabled goods and ideas to move between China in the East and the Atlantic islands in the West—which can be called the [[Archaic globalization|early history of globalisation]]—is fairly advanced; one key historian in this field is [[Janet Abu-Lughod]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [81-83].&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding of communication within sub-saharan Africa or the Americas is, by contrast, far more limited.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|978-1903153703}}, pp. 70-84 [80-81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent history-writing, therefore, has begun to explore how it might be possible meaningfully to write history that spans the Old World, where human activities were fairly interconnected, and establishes its relationship with other worlds, such as the Americas and Oceania. In the assessment of [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]], [[John Darwin (historian)|John Darwin]], [[Margret Frenz]], and [[Chris Wickham]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;Global history may be boundless, but global historians are not. Global history cannot usefully mean the history of everything, everywhere, all the time. [...] Three approaches [...] seem to us to have real promise. One is global history as the pursuit of significant historical problems across time, space, and specialism. This can sometimes be characterized as [[comparative history|‘comparative’ history]]. [...] Another is connectedness, including transnational relationships. [...] The third approach is the study of globalization [...]. Globalization is a term that needs to be rescued from the present, and salvaged for the past. To define it as always encompassing the whole planet is to mistake the current outcome for a very ancient process.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, John Darwin, and Chris Wickham, 'Introduction: The Prospect of Global History', in ''The Prospect of Global History'', ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 3–22 [3] {{DOI|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732259.001.0001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A number of commentators have pointed to the history of the earth's [[climate]] as a useful approach to World History in the Middle Ages, noting that certain climate events had effects on all human populations.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Atwell, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078878 Volcanism and Short-Term Climatic Change in East Asian and World History, c. 1200-1699]', ''Journal of World History'', 12.1 (Spring 2001), 29-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard W.

==Main trends==

The Post-classical era saw several common developments or themes. There was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas; the rise and/or spread of the three major world, or missionary, religions; and a period of rapidly expanding trade and trade networks.

=== Growth of civilization ===
{{Main|Civilization}}[[File:Líneas de Nazca, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 54.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Nazca culture]] which produced the [[Nazca Lines]] were one of South America's Andean Civilizations thriving from the 1st to the 8th century. Photograph by Diego Delso. ]]
First was the expansion and growth of civilization into new geographic areas across [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Mesoamerica]], and western [[South America]]. However, as noted by world historian [[Peter N. Stearns]], there were no common global political trends during the post-classical period, rather it was a period of loosely organized states and other developments, but no common political patterns emerged.&lt;ref name=weller-stearns/&gt; In Asia, China continued its historic [[dynastic cycle]] and became more complex, improving its bureaucracy. The creation of the Islamic Empires established a new power in the Middle East, North Africa, and [[Central Asia]]. Africa created the [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] and [[Mali Empire|Mali]] kingdoms in the West. The fall of Roman civilization not only left a power vacuum for the Mediterranean and Europe, but forced certain areas to build what some historians might call new civilizations entirely.{{sfn|Birken|1992|pages=451–461}} An entirely different political system was applied in Western Europe (i.e. [[feudalism]]), as well as a different society (i.e. [[manorialism]]). But the once East Roman Empire, Byzantium, retained many features of old Rome, as well as Greek and Persian similarities. Kiev Rus' and subsequently Russia began development in Eastern Europe as well. In the isolated Americas, Mesoamerica saw the building of the [[Aztec]] Empire, while the Andean region of South America saw the establishment of the [[Inca Empire]].

=== Spread of universal religions ===
{{Main|History of religion}}
[[File:Siege of Acre.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|Siege of Acre (1191)]], religious wars were common in Post-classical times. One of the largest of such wars were the [[Crusades]]. Picture dated from 1280.|200x200px]]
Religion that envisaged the possibility that all humans could be included in a universal order had emerged already in the first millennium BC, particularly with Buddhism. In the following millennium, Buddhism was joined by two other major, universalising, missionary religions, both developing from [[Judaism]]: Christianity and Islam. By the end of the period, these three religions were between them widespread, and often politically dominant, across the Old World.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'', trans. by Yuval Noah Harari, John Purcell and Haim Watzman (London: Harvill Secker, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1846558238|978-1846558245}}, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buddhism]] spread from India into China and flourished there briefly before using it as a hub to spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam;{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} a similar effect occurred with Confucian revivalism in the later centuries.&lt;ref name="Yuval Noah Harari 2014"/&gt;
* [[Christianity]] had become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, and continued spreading into northern and eastern Europe during the post-classical period at the expense of belief systems that Christians labelled [[Paganism|pagan]].{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} An attempt was even made to incur upon the Middle East during the [[Crusades]]. The split of the [[Catholic Church]] in Western Europe and the [[Orthodox Church]] in Eastern Europe encouraged religious and cultural diversity in Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Fletcher |title=The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity, 371-1386 AD |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Islam]] began between 610 and 632, with a series of revelations to [[Muhammad]]. It helped unify the warring [[Bedouin]] clans of the Arabian peninsula and, through a rapid series of [[Muslim conquests]], became established to the west across [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|North Africa]], the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberian Peninsula]], and parts of [[Islam in Africa|West Africa]], and to the east across [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]], [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang|Central Asia]], [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]], and [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam J. |last=Silverstein |title=Islamic History: A Very Short Introduction |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0199545728 |pages=9–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade and communication ===
{{Main|Trade route}}
[[File:Rakaposhi View from Babusar Top.jpg|left|thumb| [[Babusar Pass]] in [[Pakistan]], part of the wider [[Silk Road]] network of overland routes. Image provided by Attabik Awan.]]
Finally, communication and trade across [[Afro-Eurasia]] increased rapidly. The [[Silk Road]] continued to spread cultures and ideas through trade and throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trade networks were established between West Europe, Byzantium, early Russia, the Islamic Empires, and the [[Far East]]ern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|title=Environment and Trade: The Viking Age|publisher=Khan Academy|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005514/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/modal/a/environment-and-trade-viking-age|archive-date=2018-06-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa the earlier introduction of the Camel allowed for a new and eventually large [[Trans-Saharan trade]] which connected Sub-Saharan West Africa to Eurasia. The Islamic Empires adopted many Greek, Roman, and Indian advances and spread them through the Islamic sphere of influence, allowing these developments to reach Europe, North and West Africa, and Central Asia. Islamic sea trade helped connect these areas, including those in the [[Indian Ocean]] and in the [[Mediterranean]], replacing Byzantium in the latter region. The Christian Crusades into the Middle East (as well as Muslim Spain and [[Sicily]]) brought Islamic science, technology, and goods to Western Europe.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=288}} Western trade into East Asia was pioneered by [[Marco Polo]]. Importantly, China began the sinicization (or Chinese influence) of regions like Japan,{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=162–167}} Korea, and Vietnam through trade and conquest. Finally, the growth of the [[Mongol Empire]] in Central Asia established safe trade such as to allow goods, cultures, ideas, and disease to spread between Asia, Europe, and Africa.

The Americas had their own trade network, however theirs was limited by the lack of draft animals and the wheel. In [[Oceania]] some of the island chains of [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] also engaged in trade with one another.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Historical climatology|Little Ice Age}}During Post-Classical times, there is evidence that many regions of the world were affected similarly by global climate conditions however, direct effects in temperature and precipitation varied by region. According to [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] changes did not all occur sanctimoniously at once. Generally however studies found that temperatures were relatively warmer, in the eleventh century, but colder by the early seventeenth century. It is uncertain the degree of climate change which occurred in all regions across the world, and whether such changes were all part of a global trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb09climatology/files/2012/03/Pages_2013_NatureGeo.pdf |title=Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=339 |date=2013-04-21 |doi=10.1038/NGEO1797|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..339P |last1=Ahmed |first1=Moinuddin |last2=Anchukaitis |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Asrat |first3=Asfawossen |last4=Borgaonkar |first4=Hemant P. |last5=Braida |first5=Martina |last6=Buckley |first6=Brendan M. |last7=Büntgen |first7=Ulf |last8=Chase |first8=Brian M. |last9=Christie |first9=Duncan A. |last10=Cook |first10=Edward R. |last11=Curran |first11=Mark A.J. |last12=Diaz |first12=Henry F. |last13=Esper |first13=Jan |last14=Fan |first14=Ze-Xin |last15=Gaire |first15=Narayan P. |last16=Ge |first16=Quansheng |last17=Gergis |first17=Joëlle |last18=González-Rouco |first18=J.

There are climate periods that could be roughly said to account for large scale climate trends in the Post Classical Period. These include the [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]], the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. The [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|Extreme Weather Events of 536–537]] were likely initiated by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Lake llopango caldera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Sulfate emitted into the air initiated global cooling, migrations and crop failures worldwide possibly intensifying an already cooler time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160208112918.htm|title=Old trees reveal Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) around 1,500 years ago|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that the world's temperature remained colder on average for at least a century afterwards.

The [[Medieval Warm Period|Medieval Warming Period]] from 950–1250 occurred mostly throughout the northern hemisphere causing many areas to have warmer summers, the high temperatures would only be surpassed by the Global Warming of the 20th/21st centuries. It has been hypothesized that the warm of temperatures allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland, due to ice-free waters at the time. Outside of Europe there is evidence of warming conditions, including higher temperatures in China and major North American droughts which adversely effected numerous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.memphis.edu/NADA/TimeSeriesDisplay.aspx|title=Drought Congruence 1000-1300, Central United States|last=|first=|date=2010|website=North American Drought Atlas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1250, glaciers began to expand in Greenland effecting its [[Thermohaline circulation]], cooling the entire North Atlantic. In the 14th century, the growing season in Europe became unreliable, meanwhile in China the cultivation of Oranges were driven southward by colder temperatures. Especially in Europe, the Little Ice Age had large cultural ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eh-resources.org/timeline-middle-ages/|title=Timeline Middle Ages and Early Modern Period – Environmental History Resources|work=Environmental History Resources|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Little Ice Age]] would persist until the industrial revolution, far beyond the time-frame of the Post Classical Period.&lt;ref name="Hendy2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hendy | first1 = E.| last2 = Gagan | first2 = M.| last3 = Alibert | first3 = C.| last4 = McCulloch | first4 = M.| last5 = Lough | first5 = J.| last6 = Isdale | first6 = P.| title = Abrupt decrease in tropical Pacific sea surface salinity at end of Little Ice Age| journal = Science| volume = 295| issue = 5559| pages = 1511–1514| year = 2002| pmid = 11859191| doi = 10.1126/science.1067693|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1511H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes for the little Ice-Age are unclear, possible explanations include [[Solar maximum|sunspots]], [[Earth's orbit|orbital cycles of the Earth]], [[Volcano|volcanic activity]], [[Thermohaline circulation|ocean circulation]], and man made [[population decline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira_research/Pongratz_Caldeira.html|title=Carnegie Department of Global Ecology|website=dge.carnegiescience.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
{{main|Medieval Middle East}}

The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Postclassical Era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the [[Caliphate|Arabian Empires]].

Photograph provided by Wikipedia User Oscar11234]]

In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated by empires and their spheres of influence; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Outline of History|last=Wells|first=H.G|publisher=Garden City Publishing Inc|year=1920|isbn=|location=Garden City, NUY|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.

While the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the Turkic-based [[Seljuq Empire]].
After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.

The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harper Atlas of World History|last=Vidal-Nanquet|first=Pierre|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joint European forces mainly from [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=328|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=331|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|year=|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turko-Mongol]], [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].

These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety of ways. Most of these peoples practiced spiritual, animistic religions. Africa was culturally separated between Saharan Africa (which consisted of [[North Africa]] and the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]) and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (everything south of the Sahara). Sub-Saharan Africa was further divided into the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], which covered everything north of [[Central Africa]], including [[West Africa]]. The area south of the Sudan was primarily occupied by the [[Bantu peoples]] who spoke the [[Bantu language]]. From 1100 onward [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] and the [[Islamic World]] became dependent on Africa for gold.

'''Sub Saharan Africa'''

After 650 approximately urbanization expanded for the first time beyond the ancient kingdoms [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] and [[Nubia]]. The Precolonial civilizations of African Civilization can be divided into three categories based on religion.  (1) Christian Civilizations on the [[Horn of Africa]] (2) Islamic Civilizations which formed in the Niger River valley in West Africa, and on the coast of East Africa and (3) Traditional Societies which adhered to native African Religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/sub-saharan-africa/#age-of-pre-colonial-civilization|title=History of Sub-Saharan Africa {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of the Sahara African kingdoms developed based on continental trade with one another through land based routes and generally avoided sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Atlas of World History|editor-last=Barraclough|editor-first=Geoffrey|publisher=Borders Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0681502888|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub Saharan Africa was part of two large, separate trading networks, the Trans Saharan trade which bridged commerce between West and North Africa. Due to the huge profits from trade native African Islamic empires arose, including those of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=225|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, [[Musa I of Mali|Mana Masua]] king of Mali may have been the wealthiest person of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tschanz|first=David|title=Lion of Mali: The Hajj of Mansa Musa|url=https://www.academia.edu/1593503|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mali, the city of [[Timbuktu]] was an international center of science and well known throughout the Islamic World, particularly from the [[Sankore Madrasah|University of Sankore]].

There has been difficulty applying the word 'medieval' or 'post classical' to the history of South Asia. This section follows historian Stein Burton's definition that corresponds from the 8th century to the 16th century, more of less following the same time frame of the Post Classical Period and the European Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stein|first=Burton|author-link=Burton Stein|editor-last=Arnold|editor-first=D.|date=27 April 2010|title=A History of India|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-1405195096|page=105|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 13th century, there was no less than 20 to 40 different states on the Indian Subcontinent which hosted a variety of cultures, languages, writing systems and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: A History|last=Keay|first=John|authorlink=John Keay|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2000|pages=xx–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the time period [[Buddhism]] was predominant throughout the area with the short lived [[Pala Empire]] on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo Gangetic Plain]] sponsoring the faith's institutions. One such institution was the Buddhist [[Nalanda University]] in modern-day [[Bihar|Bihar, India]] was a center of scholarship and brought a divided South Asia onto the global intellectual stage.

J. R. Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Southern India, the [[Hindu]] Kingdom of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] gained prominence with an overseas empire that controlled parts of modern-day Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|Indonesia]] as oversees territories and helped spread Hinduism into the historic culture of these places.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Asia'' by B.V. Rao p.211&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period, neighboring areas such as [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[History of Tibet|Tibet]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] were under [[Greater India|South Asian influence]].

From 1206 onward a series of [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Islamic invasions]] based from modern day Afghanistan and Iran conquered massive portions of Northern India, founding the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultante]] which remained supreme until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history : cultures, states, and societies to 1500|publisher=|others=Berger, Eugene., Israel, George L., Miller, Charlotte., Parkinson, Brian (Brian R.), Reeves, Andrew., Williams, Nadejda.|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=107|oclc=961216293|last1 = Berger|first1 = Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George L.|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delhi Sultanate introduced Islam to the conquered populations for the first time. Native religions fared differently, [[Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent|Buddhism declined]] in South Asia vanishing in many areas but Hinduism survived and reinforced itself in areas conquered by [[Hindu–Islamic relations|Muslims]]. In the far South the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijanyagar]] was not conquered by any Muslim state in the period. The turn of the 16th century would see the rise of a new Islamic Empire – the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the establishment of European trade posts by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]].

[[File:Borobdur9205.jpg|thumb|View of [[Borobudur]], from center point of view. Located in [[Magelang|Megelang]], [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. Built in the 9th century Borobudur is the largest Buddhist Temple in the world.|alt=|left]]From the 8th century onward Southeast Asia stood to benefit from the trade taking place between South and East Asia, numerous kingdoms arose in the region due to the flow of wealth passing through the [[Strait of Malacca]]. While Southeast Asia had numerous outside influences [[Greater India|India]] was the greatest source of inspiration for the region.  North Vietnam as an exception was culturally closer to China for centuries due to conquest.

Since rule from the third century BC North Vietnam continued to be subjugated by Chinese states, although they continually resisted periodically. There were three periods of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese Domination]] that spanned near 1100 years. Vietnam gained long lasting independence in the 10th century when China was [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|divided]].  Nonetheless even as an independent state a sort of begrudging [[sinicization]] occurred. By the end of the Postclassical Era, Vietnam would be in control of its own [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. South Vietnam was governed by  the ancient Hindu [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] but was annexed by [[Cham–Annamese War|Vietnamese invaders]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=annam+sacked+their+country+vietnamese+smashed+champa+cham+officials+told+the+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=annam%20sacked%20their%20country%20vietnamese%20smashed%20champa%20cham%20officials%20told%20the%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur|first=Ben|last=Kiernan|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|location=|page=110|isbn=978-0300144253|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and maritime trade between China and [[South Asia]] created the foundation for Southeast Asia's first major empires; including the [[Khmer Empire]] from Cambodia and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] from Indonesia. During the Khmer Empire's height in the 12th century the city of [[Angkor Thom]] was among the largest of the pre-modern world due to its water management. [[Jayavarman II|King Jayavarman II]] constructed over a hundred hospitals throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia|first=George|last=Cœdès|isbn=978-0824803681|location=Honolulu|oclc=961876784|year=1968|publisher=East-West Center Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby rose the [[Pagan Empire]] in modern-day Burma, using elephants as military might.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chronicle of world history.|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky|isbn=978-1568526805|location=Old Saybrook, CT|page=211|oclc=298782520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Buddhist [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and its tolerance for believers of older polytheistic gods helped  [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] become supreme in the region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In Indonesia, [[Srivijaya]] from the 7th through 14th century was a [[Thalassocracy]] that focused on maritime city states and trade. Controlling the vital choke points of the [[Sunda Strait|Sunda]] and [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca straits]] it became rich from trade ranging from Japan through Arabia. Gold, Ivory and Ceramics were all major commodities traveling through port cities. The Empire was also responsible for the construction of wonders such as [[Borobudur]]. During this time Indonesian sailors crossed the [[Indian Ocean]]; evidence suggests that they may have colonized [[History of Madagascar|Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="Madagascar Founded By Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/madagascar-women-120320.html |title=Madagascar Founded By Women  |publisher=Discovery.com|date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian culture spread to the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Philippines]], likely through Indonesian trade resulting in the first documented use of writing in the archipelago and [[Indianized kingdom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History by Richard Bulliet, Pamela Crossley, Daniel Headrick, Steven Hirsch, Lyman Johnson p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time changing economic and political conditions else where and wars weakened the traditional empires of South East Asia. While the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol Invasions]] did not directly annex Southeast Asia the war-time devastation paved way for the rise of new nations. In the 15th century the Khmer Empire was supplanted by the Thai [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] and [[Srivijaya|Sri Vijaya]] was overtaken by the [[Majapahit]] and later the Islamic [[Malacca Sultanate]] by 1450.

[[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]] and [[Asuka period|Japan]] sinicized because their ruling class were largely impressed by China's bureaucracy.

China exhibited much interest in [[Foreign relations of imperial China|foreign affairs]], during the Tang and Song dynasties.

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the [[Mongolia]] homeland under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206.

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], or one of his other sons such as [[Tolui]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], or [[Jochi]]. After [[Möngke Khan]] died, rival ''[[kurultai]]'' councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers [[Ariq Böke]] and [[Kublai Khan]], who then not only fought each other in the [[Toluid Civil War]], but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Biran |title=Qaidu and the Rise of the Independent Mongol State in Central Asia |publisher=The Curzon Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0700706310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatayid]] and [[House of Ögedei|Ögedeid]] families.

Though the Mongols launched many more invasions into the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors.

By the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the [[Golden Horde]] khanate in the northwest; the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the west; the [[Ilkhanate]] in the southwest; and the [[Yuan dynasty]] based in modern-day [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="China p413"&gt;''The Cambridge History of China: Alien Regimes and Border States''. p.&amp;nbsp;413.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the nominal suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson.

===The Silk Road===
{{main|History of Central Asia|History of Siberia|Silk Road}}[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|left|thumb|Central Asian Buddhist Monks, the Silk Road allowed for the exchange for ideas as well as goods. A Caucasian looking [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher possibly [[Sogdia]]n instructs an East-Asian monk. Dated from the 9th century near [[Turpan|Turfan, Xinxiang, China]] |214x214px]]
The Silk Road was a Eurasian trade route that played a large role in global communication and interaction. It stimulated cultural exchange; encouraged the learning of new languages; resulted in the trade of many goods, such as silk, gold, and spices; and also spread religion and disease.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} It is even claimed by some historians – such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[William Hardy McNeill]], [[Jerry H. Bentley]], and [[Marshall Hodgson]] – that the Afro-Eurasian world was loosely united culturally, and that the Silk Road was fundamental to this unity.{{sfn|Christian|2000|pages=1–21}} This major trade route began with the [[Han dynasty]] of China, connecting it to the Roman Empire and any regions in between or nearby. At this time, Central Asia exported horses, [[wool]], and [[jade]] into China for the latter's silk; the Romans would trade for the Chinese commodity as well, offering wine in return.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=101}} The Silk Road would often decline and rise again in trade from the Iron Age to the Postclassical Era. Following one such decline, it was reopened in Central Asia by [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Ban Chao]] during the 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The Silk Road was also a major factor in spreading religion across Afro-Eurasia. Muslim teachings from Arabia and [[Persia]] reached East Asia. Buddhism spread from India, to China, to Central Asia. One significant development in the spread of Buddhism was the carving of the [[Gandhara]] School in the cities of [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] and the [[Peshwar]], allegedly in the mid 1st century.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|page=568}}

The route was vulnerable to spreading plague. The [[Plague of Justinian]] originated in East Asia and had a major outbreak in Europe in 542 causing the deaths of a quarter of the Mediterranean's population. Trade between Europe, Africa and Asia along the route was at least partially responsible for spreading the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/|title=Justinian's Plague (541–542 CE)|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular theory that the Black Death was caused by the Mongol conquests. The claim is that the direct link that it opened between the East and West provided the path for rats and fleas that carried the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780691135892|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no concrete historical evidence to this theory, the plague is considered endemic on the steppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction|last=Milward|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199782864|location=Oxford|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were vulnerabilities as well to changing political situations. The rise of Islam changed the Silk Road, because Muslim rulers generally closed the Silk Road to [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] to an extent Europe would be cut off from Asia for centuries. Specifically, the political developments that affected the Silk Road included the emergence of the Turks, the political movements of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires, and the rise of the Arabs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|last2=Sims-Williams|first2=Ursula|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1932476121|location=Chicago, IL|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Song Tapestry.jpg|thumb|Chinese-Song-era tapestry, Chinese Silk was carried west over large distances and sold for large profits.|alt=Chinese-Song era tapestry|264x264px]]

The Silk Road flourished again in the 13th century during the reign of the Mongol Empire, which through conquest had brought stability in Central Asia comparable to the [[Pax Romana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=146|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by a Muslim historian that Central Asia was peaceful and safe to transverse &lt;blockquote&gt;"(Central Asia) enjoyed such a peace that a man might have journeyed from the land of sunrise to the land of sunset with a golden platter upon his head without suffering the least violence from anyone."{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, trade and communication between Europe, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East required little effort. Handicraft production, art, and scholarship prospered, and wealthy merchants enjoyed cosmopolitan cities.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=321}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Silk Road trade played a role in spreading the infamous [[Black Death]]. Originating in China, the [[bubonic plague]] was spread by Mongol warriors catapulting diseased corpses into enemy towns in the [[Crimea]]. The disease, spread by rats, was carried by merchant ships sailing across the Mediterranean that brought the plague back to Sicily, causing an [[epidemic]] in 1347.{{sfn|Thompson|O'Toole|Patrick|Pruneski|2009|page=310}} Nevertheless, after the 15th century, the Silk Road disappeared from regular use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was primarily a result from the growing sea travel pioneered by Europeans, which allowed the trade of goods by sailing around the southern tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Westerner and Arab practicing geometry 15th century manuscript.jpg|left|thumb|Westerner and Arab practicing geometry 15th century manuscript]]
The term ''Post Classical Science'' is often used in Academic Circles and in college courses to combine the study of [[European science in the Middle Ages|Medieval European Science]] and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Medieval Islamic Science]] due to their interactions with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/HIS-SCI-STUDY-GUIDE/0036_postClassicalScience.html|title=Outline – Post-Classical Science – History of Science Study Guide – Dr Robert A.

In the case of the Western World and in Islamic realms much emphasis was placed on preserving the rationalist Greek Tradition of figures such as [[Aristotle]]. In the context of science within Islam there is a debate as to whether Islamic Scientists simply preserved accomplishments from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] or built upon earlier Greek advances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1945) ''[[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]]'', book 2, part 2, chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdus Salam]], H.R.

=== Literate Culture and Arts ===
{{main|History of literature|History of art|History of music}}
[[File:Genji emaki sekiya.jpg|thumb|12th century illustration from the ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Gengji]]'', the world's first novel.]]

[[File:Ut Queant Laxis.ogg|left|thumb|Italy, 8th century ''Ut Queant Laxis'']]
Within Eurasia, there were four major civilization groups that had literate cultures and created literature and arts. These include Europe, The Middle East, South Asia and East
Asia. Southeast Asia could be a possible fifth category but was influenced heavily from both South and East Asia literal cultures. All four cultures in Post-Classical Times used [[poetry]], [[drama]] and [[prose]]. Throughout the period and until the 19th century poetry was the dominant form of literary expression. In the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and China great poetic works often used figurative language. Examples include, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Shakuntala]]'', the [[Arabic]] ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Thousand and one nights]]'', [[Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]] '' and works by the Chinese [[Du Fu]]. In Japan, prose uniquely thrived more than in other geographic areas. The ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is considered the world's first realistic novel written in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/world-literature-music/|title=World Literature and Music {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, most regions of the world only used [[Melody|melodies]] as opposed to [[harmony]]. Medieval Europe was the lone exception to this rule, developing harmonic music in the 14th/15th century as musical culture transitioned form sacred music (meant for the church) to secular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-overview/western-music-timeline/|title=Western Music Timeline {{!}} Essential Humanities|website=www.essential-humanities.net|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Asian and Mid-Eastern music were similar to each other for their use of [[Microtonal music|microtone]]. East-Asian music shared some similarities with European Music for using a [[Pentatonic scale|pentatnotic scale]].

==The Americas==
{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}

The Postclassical Era of the Americas can be considered set at a different time span from that of Afro-Eurasia. As the developments of Mesoamerican and Andean civilization differ greatly from that of the Old World, as well as the speed at which it developed, the Postclassical Era in the traditional sense does not take place until near the end of the Medieval Age in Afro-Eurasia. As such, for the purposes of this article, the [[Classic stage]] of the Americas will be discussed here, which takes place from about 400 to 1400. For the technical Postclassical stage in American development, see [[Post-Classic stage]].

===North America===
As a continent there was little unified trade or communication. Advances in agriculture spread northward from Measoamerica indirectly through trade. Major cultural areas however still developed independently of each other.

==== Norse Contact and the Polar Regions ====
{{Main|Norse colonization of North America}}
[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|Authentic reconstruction of Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Photo provided by Dylan Kereluk.]]

While there was little regular contact between the Americas and the Old World the [[Vikings|Norse Vikings]] explored and even colonized [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]] as early as 1000. None of these settlements survived past [[Middle Ages|Medieval Times]]. Outside of Scandinavia knowledge of the discovery of the Americas was interpreted as a [[Vinland#Medieval geographers|remote island]] or the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|title=[Vinland in] Chapter 39|first=Adam of|last=Bremen|date=30 November 1977|website=www.canadianmysteries.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100208/http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/writtenclues/4125en.html|archivedate=17 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse arriving from Greenland settled Greenland from approximately 980 to 1450.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Norse arrived in southern [[Greenland]] prior to the 13th century approach of [[Inuit]] [[Thule people]] in the area. The extent of the interaction between the Norse and Thule is unclear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Greenland was valuable to the Norse due to trade of ivory that came from the tusks of walruses. The [[Little Ice Age]] adversely effected the colonies and they vanished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of archaeology|last=1956-|first=Cunliffe, Barry W.

The Norse also explored and colonized farther south in [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland Canada]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] referred to by the Norse as ''[[Vinland]]''. The colony at most existed for twenty years and resulted in no known transmission of diereses or technology to the [[First Nations]]. To the Norse ''Vinland'' was known for plentiful grape vines to make superior wine. One reason for the colony's failure was constant violence with the native [[Beothuk]] tribe who the Norse referred to as [[Skræling|Skraeling]].

After initial expeditions there is a possibility that the Norse continued to visit modern day Canada. Surviving records from Medieval Iceland indicate some sporadic voyages to a land called ''[[Markland]]''  possibly the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada]] as late as the 1347 presumably to collect wood for deforested Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seaver |first=Kristen A. |title=The Frozen Echo: Greenland and the Exploration of North America, Ca.

[[Native American in the United States|Native American tribes]] varied greatly in characteristics; some, including the [[Mississippian culture]] and the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] were complex chiefdoms. Other nations which inhabited the states of the modern northern United States and Canada had less complexity and did not follow technological changes as quickly. Approximately around the year 500 during the [[Woodland period]] , Native Americans began to transition to bows and arrows from spears for hunting and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archaeology.uiowa.edu/american-indian-archery-technology-0|title=American Indian Archery Technology {{!}} The Office of the State Archaeologist|website=archaeology.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancement however was uneven. During the 12th century was the widespread adoption of Corn as a staple crop in the [[Eastern United States]]. Corn would continue to be the staple crop of natives in the Eastern United States and Canada until the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].
[[File:Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado USA.JPG|thumb|Stonework Mesa Verde National Park Colorado|133x133px]]

In The Eastern United States rivers were the medium of trade and communication. [[Cahokia]] located in the modern U.S [[State of Illinois]] was among the most significant within the Mississippi Culture. Focused around [[Monks Mound]] archeology indicates the population increased exponentially after 1000 because it manufactured important tools for agriculture and cultural attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=393|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1350 Cahokia was abandoned, environmental factors have been proposed for the  city's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.wisc.edu/as-the-river-rises-cahokias-emergence-and-decline-linked-to-mississippi-river-flooding/|title=As the river rises: Cahokia's emergence and decline linked to Mississippi River flooding|website=news.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Ancestral Puebloans constructed clusters of buildings in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] site located in the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]]. Individual houses may have been occupied by more than 600 residents at any one time. Chaco Canyon was the only pre-Columbian site in the United States to build paved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carballo|first=David M|title=Trade Routes in the Americas Before Columbus|url=https://www.academia.edu/4998969|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Toltec [[Atlantean figures]] at the Tula site. The [[Toltec|Toltec Civilization]] inspired the later [[Aztecs]]. Photograph provided by the Wikipedia User Luidger|alt=|left]]At the beginning of the global Post Classic Period, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was at its zenith, housing over 125,000 people, at 450 A.D it was the sixth largest city in the world at the time. The city's residents built the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] the third largest pyramid of the world, oriented to follow astronomical events. Suddenly in the 6th and 7th centuries, the city suddenly declined possibly as a result of severe environmental damage caused by [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]. There is evidence that large parts of the city were burned, possibly in a domestic rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Teotihuacan/|title=Teotihuacan|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's legacy would inspire all future civilizations in the region.

Following Teotihuacan came the Classic Age of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Civilization]] clustered in dozens of city states on the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and modern day [[Guatemala]]. The most significant of these cities were [[Chichen Itza]] which often fiercely competed with its neighbors to be the dominant economic influence in the region. The Mayans had an upper caste of priests, who were well versed in astronomy, mathematics and writing. The Mayan developed the concept of zero, and a 365-day calendar which possibly per-dates its creation in Old-World societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab58|title=HISTORY OF MESOAMERICAN CIVILIZATION|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 900, many Mayan cities suddenly declined in a period of drought.[[File:Aztec11 Bloodletting.jpg|thumb|Aztec Bloodletting, priests conduct a heart sacrifice, from the ''Tudela Codex'', 16th century.|197x197px]]

The [[Toltec Empire]] arose the from the [[Toltec]] culture, and were remembered as wise and benevolent leaders. One priest-king called [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]] advocated against human sacrifice. After his death in 947, civil wars of religious character broke out between those who supported and opposed Topiltzin's teachings. Modern historians however are skeptical of the extent of Toltec and influence and believe that much of the information known about the Toltecs was created by the later Aztecs as an inspiration myth.

In the 1300s, a small band of violent, religious radicals called the [[Aztec]]s began minor raids throughout the area.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=148|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they began to claim connections with the Toltec civilization, and insisted they were the rightful successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://glencoe.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0024122010/899891/Bentley5e_Chapter_20_Intro_Final.pdf|title=Traditions and Encounters, AP Edition , 5th Edition|last=Bentley|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chapter 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began to grow in numbers and conquer large areas of land.

In 1430 the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] allied with other powerful [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] speaking cities- [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] to create the Aztec Empire otherwise known as Triple-Alliance. Though referred to as an empire the Aztec Empire functioned as a system of tribute collection with Tenochtitlan at its center.  By the turn of the 16h century "[[flower war]]s" between the Aztecs and rival states such as [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] had continued for over fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors – Cortés |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}

South American civilization was concentrated in the Andean region which had already hosted complex cultures since 2,500&amp;nbsp;BC.  East of the Andean region, the natives were generally semi nomadic. Discoveries on the [[Amazon basin|Amazon River Basin]] indicate the region likely had a pre-contact population of five million people and hosted complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the continent numerous agricultural peoples from [[History of Colombia|Colombia]] to [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] steadily advanced until European contact.

During [[Ancient history|Ancient times]] the Andean Region had developed civilizations independent of outside influences including that of [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite  6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Post Classical era a cycle of civilizations continued until Spanish Contact. Collectively Andean societies lacked currency, a written language and solid draft animals enjoyed by old world civilizations. Instead Andeans developed other methods to foster their growth, including use of the [[quipu]] system to communicate messages, lamas to carry smaller loads and an economy based on [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Societies were often based on strict social hierarchies and economic redistribution from the ruling class.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the first half of the Post Classical Period the Andean Region was dominated by two almost equally powerful states. In the North of Peru was the [[Wari Empire]] and in the South of Peru and Bolivia was there is the [[Tiwanaku empire]] both of whom were inspired by the earlier [[Moche culture|Moche People]]. While the extent of their relationship to each other known, it is believed that they were in a Cold-War with one another, competing but avoiding direct conflict to avoid [[mutual assured destruction]]. Without war there was prosperity and around the year 700 Tiwanaku city hosted a population of 1.4.&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 8th century both states declined due to changing environmental conditions, laying the ground work for the Incas to emerge as a distinct culture centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=387|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century the [[Inca Empire]] rose to annex all other nations in the area. Led by their, sun-god king, [[Sapa Inca]], they slowly conquered what is now [[Peru]], and built their society throughout the Andes cultural region. The Incas spoke the [[Quechua languages]] The Incas used the advances created by earlier Andean societies .Incas have been known to have used [[abacus]]es to calculate mathematics. The Inca Empire is known for some of its magnificent structures, such as [[Machu Picchu]] in the [[Cusco region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1940771106|location=Dahlonega, GA|page=389|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The empire expanded quickly northwards to Ecuador, Southwards to central Chile. To the north of the Inca Empire remained the independent [[Tairona]] and [[Muisca Confederation|Musica Confederation]] who practiced agriculture and gold metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Muisca_Civilization/|title=Muisca Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Tairona_Civilization/|title=Tairona Civilization|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate from developments in [[Afro-Eurasia]] and the Americas the region of greater [[Oceania]] continued to develop independently of the outside world. In [[History of Australia|Australia]], the society of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and [[Melanesia]] changed little through the Post Classical Period, they had first arrived in the area from Africa around 50,000&amp;nbsp;BC.

During Post-classical Times the [[Micronesia]]n and the [[Polynesia]]n peoples constructed cities in some areas such as [[Nan Madol]] and [[Muʻa (Tongatapu)|Mu'a]]. Around 1200&amp;nbsp;AD the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] spread its influence far and wide throughout the South Pacific Islands, being described by academics as a maritime chiefdom which used trade networks to keep power centralized around the king's capital.

As the postclassical era drew to a close in the 15th century, many of the empires established throughout the period were in decline. The [[Byzantine Empire]] would soon be overshadowed in the Mediterranean by Italian city states such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The Byzantines faced repeated attacks from eastern and western powers during the [[Fourth Crusade]], and declined further until the loss of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|pages=138–139|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest change came in terms of trade and technology. The global significance of the fall of the Byzantines was the disruption of overland routes between Asia and Europe. Traditional dominance of [[Nomad]]ism in Eurasia declined and the [[Pax Mongolica|Pax Mongolia]] which had allowed for interactions between different civilizations was no longer available. China, which had previously engaged in expansion and innovation became isolationist in the 14th century under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and would remain so until the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|pages=168–169|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Asia]] and [[South Asia]] were conquered by [[Gunpowder Empires]] which successfully utilized advances in military technology but closed the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Madeline C.|last=Zilfi|year=1997|title=Halil Inalcik and Donald Quataert, editors.

Europeans – specifically the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and various Italian explorers – intended to replace land travel with sea travel. Originally European exploration merely looked for new routes to reach known destinations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Post-classical history#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese Explorer [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco De Gama]] traveled to India by sea in 1498 by circumnavigating Africa around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Northrup|first=David|date=1998|title=Vasco da Gama and Africa: An Era of Mutual Discovery, 1497-1800|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/179280|journal=Journal of World History|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=189–211|doi=10.1353/jwh.2005.0107|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and the coast of Africa were already known to Europeans but none had attempted a large trading mission prior to that time. Due to navigation advances Portugal would create a [[Portuguese Empire|global colonial empire]] beginning with the conquest of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in modern-day [[Malaysia]] from 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Harper Collins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=158|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Explorers such as the Spanish sponsored Italian [[Christopher Columbus]] intended to engage in trade by traveling on unfamiliar routes west from Europe. The subsequent [[European discovery of the Americas]] in 1492 resulted in the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian exchange]] and the world's first [[globalization]]. Spanish Explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] performed the first known [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|circumnavigation]] of Earth in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908-1984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0681502888|oclc=56350180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of goods and diseases across [[ocean]]s was unprecedented in creating a more connected world. From developments in navigation and trade [[modern history]] began.

'''Prize for Military History''' (''Förderpreis für Militärgeschichte und Militärtechnikgeschichte'') is an award recognising achievements in the fields of military history and history of military technology. The prize is bestowed by the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Ministry of Defence]] every two years.

==History==
From 1992 to 2012, the prize was awarded under the name '''Werner Hahlweg Prize'''. From 1969 until his retirement in 1978, the German historian {{illm|Werner Hahlweg|de|Werner Hahlweg}} (1912–1989) held a professorship in Military History and Military Sciences at the [[University of Münster]]. In his will, he bequeathed funds to go towards a science award for military history. The prize was administered by the Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement in Koblenz (now [[Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support]], part of the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Ministry of Defence]]). After it had become known in 2012 that the prize's namesake, Hahlweg, had joined the [[SS]] in June 1933 and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1936, the Ministry of Defence decided to suspend the prize. It was reinstituted in 2017 under a new name and continues to be awarded every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal-militaergeschichte.de/neitzel_foerderpreis Interview mit Prof. Dr. Sönke Neitzel zur Umbenennung des Werner-Hahlweg-Preises in „Förderpreis für Militärgeschichte und Militärtechnikgeschichte“], [[Military History Working Group]], May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory board==
As of 2018, the advisory board includes [[Michael Epkenhans]] ([[Center for Military History and Social Sciences of the Bundeswehr]]), {{illm|Marian Füssel|de|Marian Füssel}} ([[University of Göttingen]]), {{illm|Johannes Hürter|de|Johannes Hürter}} ([[Institute of Contemporary History (Munich)]]), and [[Brendan Simms]] ([[Oxford University]]), among others. It is chaired by the historian [[Sönke Neitzel]] ([[University of Potsdam]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baainbw.de/portal/a/baain/start/aktuell/allena/!ut/p/z1/hY9BC4MwDIX_kakVnTtadCqIig43exlFi3O4VkonO-zHrzK2myyHB3kv-UKAwhmoYMs4MD1KwSbTt9S7ED87ZniPcVhGGKVO0rgVKVARY2jg9G-EmhhtVICg7jm0hrHbZjhQAwXac6uTgutVNRd6NDoopqWyZqn0tCYPpUxijT20yA4Jws73lP0KojgJiYfdMCXVCryxhT1_u6xbn4b2ykQ_8VJ2wceY7wc_z93hDV6b2ew!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922DPE20I3HV5RBO0OG3 "Förderpreis 2019 für Militärgeschichte und Militärtechnikgeschichte"], [[Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social history''', often called the '''new social history,''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at the lived experience of the past. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and new social history==
The older social history (before 1960) included numerous topics that were not part of the mainstream historiography of political, military, diplomatic and constitutional history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. [[People's history]] was sometimes so [[Marxism|Marxist]] that non-Marxists were alienated by it. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=0-582-48488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Social History movement==
The "new social history" exploded on the scene in the 1960s, quickly becoming one of the dominant styles of historiography in the U.S., Britain and Canada.  The French version, promulgated by the [[Annales School]], was very well organized and dominated French historiography, and influenced much of Europe and Latin America. [[Jürgen Kocka]] finds two meanings to "social history."  At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of historiography that focused on social structures and processes.  In this regard it stood in contrast to political or economic history.  The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it "Gesellschaftsgeschichte."  It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society: Business, Labor, and Bureaucracy in Modern Germany, 1800-1918'' (New York: Berghahn Books, 1999) pp 275-97, at p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the "Gesellschaftsgeschichte" movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, "social history" caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept -- and a rallying point -- of [[Historical revisionism|historiographic revisionism]]. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the little people, of the underdog, of popular movements, or of the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that "literary" evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring "background" of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a "History from the Bottom Up" that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become "a predictive social science."  I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Johnson, "Reflections: Looking Back at Social History," ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 39, Number 2, June 2011 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v039/39.2.johnson.html online at [[Project MUSE]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes ''[[Social Science History]]'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the specialty of the ''[[Journal of Social History]]'', edited since 1967 by [[Peter Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;. See [http://chnm.gmu.edu/jsh/ ''Journal of Social History'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well.

However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by [[cultural history]], which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] and Victoria Bonnell, eds., ''Beyond the Cultural Turn'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===
{{main|Historical demography}}
The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as [[social mobility]].  H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~demog/ H-DEMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of [[demography]], as in the study of the [[Demographic Transition]].

===Black history===
Black history or [[African-American history]] studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] was founded by [[Carter G. Woodson]] in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the ''[[Journal of African American History]],'' formerly the ''Journal of Negro History.'' Since 1926 it has sponsored [[Black History Month]] every February.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.asalh.org/ ASALH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic history===
[[Ethnic history]] is especially important in the U.S. and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including blacks or Native Americans). 
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies.  In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo F. Acuna, ''The Making of Chicana/o Studies: In the Trenches of Academe'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Making-Chicana-Studies-Latinidad-Transnational/dp/0813550025/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The Immigration and Ethnic History Society was formed in 1976 and publishes a journal for libraries and its 829 members.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.historians.org/affiliates/immigration_ethnic_his_soc.htm Immigration and Ethnic History Society]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The American Conference for Irish Studies, founded in 1960, has 1,700 members and has occasional publications but no journal.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.acisweb.com/index.php American Conference for Irish Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109234435/http://www.acisweb.com/index.php |date=2011-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The American Italian Historical Association was founded in 1966 and has 400 members; it does not publish a journal&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.aihaweb.org/ American Italian Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The American Jewish Historical Society is the oldest ethnic society, founded in 1892; it has 3,300 members and publishes ''American Jewish History''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ajhs.org American Jewish Historical Society] and [http://www.ajhs.org/academic/history.cfm journal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Polish American Historical Association was founded in 1942, and publishes a newsletter and ''Polish American Studies,'' an interdisciplinary, refereed scholarly journal twice each year.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/index.html PAHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* H-ETHNIC is a daily discussion list founded in 1993 with 1400 members; it covers topics of ethnicity and migration globally.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~ethnic/ H-ETHNIC website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor history===
{{main|Labor history (discipline)}}

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal?

===Women's history===
[[Women's history]] exploded into prominence in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mtsu.edu/~kmiddlet/history/women.html American Women's History: A Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1405149604 Teresa A. Meade and Merry Wiesner-Hanks, eds. ''A Companion to Gender History'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Social history uses the approach of women's history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to "Great Women," in the past. [[Joan Kelly|Feminist women's historians]] have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by [[Joan W. Scott]] in her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W.|title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1986|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1053–1075|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1864376?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101570710027|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.2307/1864376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social historians use Scott's concept of "perceived differences" to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the [[cultural turn]], many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/skhs/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mary-louise-adams |title=DR.

===History of the family===
{{see also|History of the family}}
The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from [[genealogy]], though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influential pioneering study ''Women, Work, and Family'' (1978) was done by [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]]. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women's place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner's 2012 book and ebook, ''The Family: A World History'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt; For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds.

===History of education===
{{main|History of education|History of education in the United States#Historiography|History of childhood care and education}}
For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] (1868-1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world.  Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes.  The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Cohen, "The history of the history of American education, 1900-1976: The uses of the past." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 46#3 (1976): 298-330. online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of [[New Left]] scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939-2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Katz|title=Reconstructing American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpeeMe6o5jIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses and never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;For a counterattack see Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Best, ed. ''Historical inquiry in education: A research agenda'' (American Educational Research Association, 1983); The most comprehensive overview of the historiography of American education, with essays by 13 scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Three fourths of British studies are institutional, says William Richardson, "British Historiography of Education in International Context at the Turn of the Century, 1996-2006," ''History of Education'', July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 569-593,&lt;/ref&gt;  but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the U.S. attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Raftery, Jane McDermid, and Gareth Elwyn Jones, "Social Change and Education in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: Historiography on Nineteenth-century Schooling," ''History of Education'', July/Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 447-463&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reeder, Schooling in the City: Educational History and the Urban Variable," ''Urban History,'' May 1992, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 23-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Herbst, "The History of Education: State of the Art at the Turn of the Century in Europe and North America," ''Paedagogica Historica'' 35, no. 3 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sanderson, "Educational and Economic History: The Good Neighbours," ''History of Education,'' July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 429-445&lt;/ref&gt;  A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, ''The Race between Education and Technology'' (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===
{{main|Urban history}}
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the U.S. It looked at the "city as process" and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major early study was [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976); Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975); and Michael P. Weber, ''Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.'' (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''Journal of Early Modern History'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural history===
{{main|Rural history}}
[[Agricultural History]] handles the economic and technological dimensions, while [[Rural history]] handles the social dimension.  Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an "orthodox" school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the "agricultural revolution."&lt;ref&gt;On British rural history see Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?"  ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481. {{ISSN|0018-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History,'' has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''The Death Rural England'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/041513885X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a "post-productivist" countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the "rural idyll."  Most rural history has focused on the [[Southern United States|American South]]—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of [[Union (American Civil War)|the North]] as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Historiography of religion}}
The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history in Europe==

===France===
{{main|Annales School}}
Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see also|Bielefeld School|Historiography of Germany}}
Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society" - ''Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' - has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] (1931-2014) and his [[Bielefeld School]] as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''[[German Studies Review]]'' 1984 7(3): 451-480. {{DOI|10.2307/1428885}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1428885 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s German historians of society, led by Wehler and [[Jürgen Kocka]] at the "Bielefeld school"  gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200. {{ISSN|1364-2529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French [[Annales School]].  After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erős Vilmos|hu}}, "In the lure of Geistesgeschichte : the theme of decline in Hungarian historiography and historical thinking in the first half of the twentieth century". ''[[European Review of History]]'' (2015) 22#3 pp 411-432. {{doi|10.1080/13507486.2014.986435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]] in 1989. [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward [[urban history]] and the conditions of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gyáni Gábor|hu}}, "Trends in contemporary Hungarian historical scholarship," ''[[Social History (journal)|Social History]],'' (2009) 34#2 pp 250-260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
When [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Communism ended]] in 1991, large parts of the [[Soviet archives]] were opened.  The historians' data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.  The old [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]],  "Impact of the Opening of Soviet Archives on Western Scholarship on Soviet Social History." ''[[Russian Review]]'' 74#3 (2015): 377-400. {{DOI|10.1111/russ.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{main|Social history of Canada}}
Social history had a "golden age" in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.  Cross, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/social-history/ "Social History,"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2008) online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Cross and Gregory S. Kealey, eds.

''Studies in Canadian Social History'' (1974). 480 pp. articles by scholars&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the "new political history," which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew W. Robertson, and David Waldstreicher, eds. ''Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Huret, "All in the Family Again? Political Historians and the Challenge of Social History," ''Journal of Policy History'', July 2009, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathi|first=Prasannan|title=The State and Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=771–778|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3parthasarathi.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[governmentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Simon|title=From Hegemony to Governmentality:  Changing Conceptions of Power in Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=705–720|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3gunn.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historic preservation]], '''sustainable preservation''' is the idea that preservation has tangible ecological benefits, on the basis that the most sustainable building is one that is already built. Historic buildings can have advantages over new construction with their often central location, historic building materials, and unique characteristics of craftsmanship. Arguing for these connections is at least partially an outgrowth of the green building movement with its emphasis on new construction. Sustainable preservation borrows many of the same principles of [[sustainable architecture]], though is unique by focusing on older buildings versus new construction.  The term "sustainable preservation" is also utilized to refer to the preservation of global heritage, archaeological and historic sites through the creation of economically sustainable businesses which support such preservation, such as the   [[Sustainable Preservation Initiative]] and the [[Global Heritage Fund]].

== History ==
The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) has popularized sustainability initiatives since their founding in 1993. Their LEED certification allowed professionals to develop expertise in the field of green building. The LEED Green Building Rating System with benchmarks was established in 2000.

The [[Association for Preservation Technology International]] formed a "Sustainable Preservation Committee" in 2004 to provide an arena for discussion, and educate on the relationship between historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apti.org/about/technical.cfm#A5A|date=2009-05-31|title=Technical Committees|work=Association for Preservation Technology International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among early discussions were a workshop in Halfax, held in 2005. This was followed a workshop on "Greenbuild &amp; LEED for Historic Building" in November 2006. The APTI annual conference in Montreal from October 22–26, 2008, also included a symposium on sustainable heritage conservation. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation also included Sustainability among several issues the Trust works on. The Trust's position statement on sustainability is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/|date=2009-05-31|title=Historic Preservation &amp; Sustainability|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Historic preservation can – and should – be an important component of any effort to promote sustainable development. The conservation and improvement of our existing built resources, including re-use of historic and older buildings, greening the existing building stock, and reinvestment in older and historic communities, is crucial to combating [[climate change]].

National Trust President Richard Moe, addressed the USGBC on November 20, 2008. His speech laid out several principles in an effort to find common ground:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/sustainability-preservation-1.html|date=2009-05-31|title=Sustainability Speeches|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Promote a culture of reuse
# Reinvest at a Community Scale
# Value the Lessons of Heritage Buildings and Communities 
# Make Use of the Economic Advantages of Reuse, Reinvestment and Retrofits
# Re-imagine Historic Preservation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Sustainability
# Take Immediate and Decisive Action

[[The Kresge Foundation]] led a Green Building Initiative from 2003 to May 29, 2009. The initiative provided planning grants for nonprofit organizations that went on to build green buildings. The foundation also demonstrated their commitment to sustainability initiatives through construction of a green headquarters in Troy, Michigan. This building incorporated a historic building on the site with new construction. These facilities were completed in 2006, and in 2008 received the Platinum-level rating from the USGBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kresge.org/index.php/headquarters/index/|date=2009-05-31|title=Our Green Headquarters|work=The Kresge Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lost Tomb of Jesus''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in [[Canada]] on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], while [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. (Jacobovici and Cameron had previously created ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]''.)  The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book's claims are the subject of controversy within the [[archaeologists|archaeological]] and [[theologians|theological]] fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars.

==Content==
The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of [[Jesus]]. The film states that ten [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen.

The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it "never before reported information" and that he had published all the details in the journal ''Antiqot'' in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family.&lt;ref  name=cnsnews&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/jesus-tomb-filmmakers-should-be-ashamed-archeologist-says "'Jesus Tomb' Filmmakers Should Be Ashamed, Archeologist Says"]&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is very unserious [sic] work. I do scholarly work…," Kloner said. "[This film] is all nonsense."&lt;ref  name=cnsnews/&gt;

Six of the nine remaining ossuaries bear inscriptions.

* ''Yeshua bar Yehosef' -- [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "Jesus son of Joseph"
* ''Maria''—written in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], but a [[Latin]] form of the Hebrew name "Miriam" ("Mary")&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/us/27jesus.html?em&amp;ex=1172725200&amp;en=cf806e5e644ad636&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=Crypt Held Bodies of Jesus and Family, Film Says |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yose''—a diminutive of "Joseph" mentioned (in its Greek form ιωσης "Joses") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}})
* ''Yehuda bar Yeshua''—possibly Aramaic for "Judah son of Jesus"
* ''Mariamene e Mara''—according to the filmmakers this is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "Mary known as the master." The similar name "[[Mariamne (name)|Mariamne]]" is found in the [[Acts of Philip]]. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at [[Harvard University]] has said, based on his study of that work, "I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=656 Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Matya''—Hebrew for 'Matthew'—''not'' claimed to be [[Matthew the Evangelist]] but "possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt;

The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the [[James Ossuary]] purported to contain the body of [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus: Explore the Evidence |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227110330/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', [[Simcha Jacobovici]] claims the [[James Ossuary]] would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately (citation needed). The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and [[Oded Golan]], one of its past owners, was charged with fraud in connection to the artifact, but exonerated on all counts of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antiquities collector acquitted of forgery charges in 'James ossuary' case|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/|website = The Globe and Mail|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington III]], who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds:
*"The James Ossuary, according to the report of the antiquities dealer that [[Oded Golan]] got the ossuary from, said that the ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not Talpiot, and had dirt in it that matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem."
*"Furthermore, [[Eusebius]] reports that the tomb marker for James's burial was close to where James was martyred near the temple mount, indeed near the famous tombs in the [[Kidron Valley]] such as the so-called [[Yad Avshalom|Tomb of Absalom]]. Talpiot is nowhere near this locale."&lt;ref name=witherington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/02/jesus-tomb-titanic-talpiot-tomb-theory.html |title= The Jesus Tomb? 'Titanic' Talpiot Tomb Theory Sunk from the Start |last=Witherington |first=Ben |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) long by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters (10 inches) on the other end (citation needed). The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) long by 26 centimeters (10.2 inches) by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) (citation needed). Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription.&lt;ref name=cnsnews/&gt; Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the [[Rockefeller Museum]] who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site (citation needed).

New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters (19.6 inches), rather than the length. The top length of the James Ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest re-measurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters (22.6 inches.) (citation needed). While compelling, this does not prove that the James Ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary.

==DNA tests==
Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] performed by [[Lakehead University]] on the remains found in the ossuary marked "Jesus son of Joseph" and the one marked "Mariamne" or "Mary" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/arts/television/03stan.html | work=New York Times | title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus | date=2007-03-03 | accessdate=2011-12-07 | first1=Alessandra | last1=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that "Jesus" and "Mariamne" were probably married "because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the remains were not dated using [[Carbon 14|radiocarbon]] to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=649 Society of Biblical Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the [[Bride of Christ (theology)|"Bride of Christ"]] (found in the writings of the New Testament). [[Jimmy Akin]], director of Apologetics and Evangelization at [[Catholic Answers]], wrote: "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [the wives of religion founders] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." As for a possible "son of Jesus," he noted: "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmyakin.typepad.com/defensor_fidei/2007/03/tomb_of_jesus_n.html |first=Jimmy |last=Akin |title=The Tomb of Jesus Nonsense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers denied that the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of [[Christianity]], such as the [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm?ls|title=Jesus tomb found, says film-maker|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-03-05 | date=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/theological_considerations/resurrection.html|title=Theological Considerations—The Resurrection|publisher=JesusFamilyTomb.com|accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's religious consultant [[James Tabor]] stated that the fact that Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he said could have been spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Islamic views===

Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic view of his disappearance]], as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: ''That they said (in boast), "We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/dispTargam.asp?l=arb&amp;t=eng&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=4&amp;nAya=157 Quran 4:157]&lt;/ref&gt; The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==

Following the March 4, 2007, airing of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' on the Discovery Channel, American journalist [[Ted Koppel]] aired a program entitled ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', whose guests included the director [[Simcha Jacobovici]], [[James Tabor]], Chair of the Department of [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, [[Jonathan Reed]], Professor of Religion at the [[University of LaVerne]] and co-author of ''Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text,'' and [[William G. Dever|William Dever]], an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.

Alan Cooperman, writer of ''The Washington Post'' article also states this: "Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, [[Amos Kloner]], who originally excavated the tomb, and [[Joe Zias]], former curator of archaeology at the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]]. Kloner told the [[Jerusalem Post]] that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," and "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film." he told the BBC News website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm ''Jesus tomb found, says film-maker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the documentary ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'', various professionals had claimed:

# concerning the ossuaries marked Yeshua` ("Jesus") and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because "the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife";
# that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Yeshua` ossuaries and referred to the James ossuary as the "missing link" from the tomb of Yeshua` (Jesus);
# and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Yeshua` had actually been the infamous James ossuary believed to contain the remains of the brother of Yeshua`.

During Ted Koppel's critique, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—a Critical Look'', Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.

# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had NOT concluded that the remains of Yeshua` and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife. In fact, he had logically stated, "you cannot genetically test for marriage."
# Koppel had a written denial from the [[Suffolk Crime Lab]] Director (Robert Genna) asserting that he had NOT stated the James ossuary patina matched that of the Yeshua` ossuary. He denied ever saying they were a match, and said he'd have to do much more comparison testing of other tombs before he could draw any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Yeshua`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it was not the same by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', that Jacobovici's and Cameron's "conclusions were already drawn in the beginning" of the inquiry and that their "argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Questions==

===The Three Skulls===

Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: "This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site quotation about the skulls.''|url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/new_discoveries/the_chevron.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Inside, they found 10 ossuaries and three skulls.''|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/185708 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Stuart | last=Laidlaw | date=2007-02-26 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the documentary==
Early Christianity scholar [[R. Joseph Hoffmann]], chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film "is all about bad assumptions," beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer."&lt;ref&gt;"Who is Entombed in the 'Jesus Tomb'?" ''U.S. News,'' March 12, 2007, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, [[Amos Kloner]], who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:
:"It makes a great story for a TV film, but it's completely impossible. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |last=Bozell |first=Brent |title=What Bones of Jesus? |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302074621/http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |archive-date=2007-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:
:"Simcha has no credibility whatsoever," says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy [[James Cameron|Cameron]], who made ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ Have Researchers Found Jesus Christ's Tomb? - Newsweek Beliefs - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227105907/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned Joe Zias has published in his own site a "viewers' guide" to the Talpiot Tomb documentary, in which he systematically rebuts the film's argumentation and gives much background information about the people involved in it.&lt;ref name=zias&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joezias.com/tomb.html | title=Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb 'documentary' | work=personal website | author = Joe Zias | date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfann also thinks the inscription read as "Jesus" has been misread and suggests that the name "Hanun" might be a more accurate rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/story/3894198p-4503665c.html |last=Matthews |first=Karen |title=Jesus tomb claim derided

''The Washington Post'' reports that [[William G. Dever]] (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:
:"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025143235/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-25 |title='Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt |last=Cooperman |first=Alan |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbury Theological Seminary]]'s [[Ben Witherington III]] points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family:&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;
* "So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus 'son of Joseph'. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that."
* "The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?"
* "One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married."
* "The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary—and that's about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names."
* "We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don't match up with the list of [Jesus's] brothers' names."

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]], self-described on their website as "North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology," has published online their own criticism of the "Jesus tomb" claim: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 AIA News - Has the Tomb of Jesus Been Discovered?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084558/http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===DNA and family evidence===

[[Darrell Bock]], a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] points out some of the inconsistencies, including: "If Jesus' family came from [[Galilee]], why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |title=No Need to Yell, Only a Challenge for Some who Need to Step Up and Could (expanded) |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304220146/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington]] points out an inconsistency related to the [[James Ossuary]]. He points out that the James Ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not [[Talpiot]]. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." In his opinion, this is problematic, because "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;

In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former [[FBI]] agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="laidlaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/185708 |title=Jesus tomb claim sparks furor |last=Laidlaw |first=Stuart |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: "[T]he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all."&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt; This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the "Jesus son of Joseph" and the "Mariamne" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.

''[[The New York Times]]'' article of February 27, 2007, ([http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/ZNYT02/702270730/-1/ZNYT reprinted in full on many websites)] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, said there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude that the bodies in the "Jesus" and "Mary Magdalene" ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. "We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," he said. "We took the story that far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one [http://jesus-crypt-fraud.blogspot.com/ blog], "the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related—hence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film."

[[William G. Dever]] said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. "I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem," Magness writes.

According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

There is no information on analyzing relation of "Mary" and "Jesus son of Joseph" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an [[ossuary]]. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of "Mariamne e Mara" and "Jesus son of Joseph."

===Interpretation of the inscriptions===

David Mavorah, a curator of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely."&lt;ref name=pilkington&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,2022252,00.html |title=Is this really the last resting place of Jesus, Mary Magdalene—and their son? |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |author2=McCarthy, Rory  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the [[The Lost Tomb of Jesus#Statistical report|statistics section above]].

Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526032109/http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 |title=Clergy, scholars assail tomb of Jesus film |publisher=The Courier-Journal |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-27}} &lt;/ref&gt; told the ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time.&lt;ref name=pilkington /&gt; Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. They just want to get money for it."&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[Richard Bauckham]], professor at the [[University of St Andrews]], catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, "Jesus" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and "Mary/Mariamne" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names "Jesus" and "Mary/Mariamne" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are "very small indeed."&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |title=Hollywood Hype: The Oscars and Jesus' Family Tomb, What Do They Share?

Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is ''possible'' to read it as "Yeshua" that "overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Yeshua` bar Yehosef''.'"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The name "Mary" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyhabermas.com/articles/The_Lost_Tomb_of_Jesus/losttombofjesus_response.htm "The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Response to the Discovery-Channel Documentary Directed by James Cameron"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Lawrence Stager|Lawrence E. Stager]], the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at [[Harvard]], said the documentary was "exploiting the whole trend that caught on with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]].'' One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'"&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[William G. Dever]] said, "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers "have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt; He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site.&lt;ref name=zias /&gt;
[[François Bovon]] has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=656 |title=Society of Biblical Literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
As I was interviewed for the Discovery Channel's program The Lost Tomb of Jesus, I would like to express my opinion here.

First, I have now seen the program and am not convinced of its main thesis. When I was questioned by Simcha Jacobovici and his team the questions were directed toward the Acts of Philip and the role of Mariamne in this text. I was not informed of the whole program and the orientation of the script.

Second, having watched the film, in listening to it, I hear two voices, a kind of double discourse. On one hand there is the wish to open a scholarly discussion; on the other there is the wish to push a personal agenda. I must say that the reconstructions of Jesus' marriage with Mary Magdalene and the birth of a child belong for me to science fiction.

Third, to be more credible, the program should deal with the very ancient tradition of the Holy Sepulcher, since the emperor Constantine in the fourth century C.E. built this monument on the spot at which the emperor Hadrian in the second century C.E. erected the forum of Aelia Capitolina and built on it a temple to Aphrodite at the place where Jesus' tomb was venerated.

Fourth, I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.

Fifth, the Mariamne of the Acts of Philip is part of the apostolic team with Philip and Bartholomew; she teaches and baptizes. In the beginning, her faith is stronger than Philip's faith. This portrayal of Mariamne fits very well with the portrayal of Mary of Magdala in the Manichean Psalms, the Gospel of Mary, and Pistis Sophia. My interest is not historical, but on the level of literary traditions. I have suggested this identification in 1984 already in an article of New Testament Studies.

====Symposium and media coverage====

Following a symposium at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html | work=Time | title=Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn | work=CNN | title= Video | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened.

Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Old Straight Track: Its Mounds, Beacons, Moats, Sites and Mark Stones''''' is a book by [[Alfred Watkins]], first published in 1925, describing the existence of alleged [[ley lines]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=Belanger&gt;[http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2003/legends33_12132003.shtml Ley Lines, Old Straight Tracks, and Earth Energies by Jeff Belanger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Watkins presents a methodical and thorough exposition of his theories of ley lines, following an earlier much shorter publication, "Early British Trackways" (1922).  The book has a preface, thirty chapters, four appendices and an index. There are many figures, and photographs taken by the author.

The book is considered the first book written about leys, and the first book to document and map alleged ley lines in Britain, primarily southern England.

The book was disregarded by archaeologists but saw a resurgence of interest with the rise of [[New Age]] ideas in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Merlin|last=Coverley|title=Psychogeography|location=Harpenden|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2010|page=52|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins' ideas also influenced contemporary [[psychogeography]], including [[Iain Sinclair]]'s ''Lud Heat'' (1975), which in turn influenced [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s novel ''[[Hawksmoor (novel)|Hawksmoor]]'' (1985).{{sfn|Coverley|2010|p=53}}

==Criticism==
Watkins' work met with early scepticism from archaeologists, one of whom, [[O. G. S. Crawford]], refused to accept advertisements for ''The Old Straight Track'' in the journal ''Antiquity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoesmith, R. |date=1990|title=Alfred Watkins: a Herefordshire Man|page= 132|location= Woonton Almeley|publisher= Logaston Press|isbn= 0-9510242-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One criticism of Watkins' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that "connect" sites is trivial and ascribable to [[coincidence]]. A statistical analysis of lines concluded: "the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Matthew|title=Archaeological Theory: An Introduction|date=29 Dec 2009|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0015-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYHwXdNVxzMC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22ley+lines%22+density#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ley%20lines%22%20density&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 May 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
The book was reprinted as {{ISBN|0-349-13707-2}} on April 2, 1994 by "Abacus". Editions or reprints were published in 1925, 1933, 1945, 1948, 1970, 1974 and 1994. The Abacus edition of 1970 was reprinted up to 1999 at least, and carries a copyright dated 1970 "Allen Watkins and Marion Watkins".

'''''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light''''' is a 2004 non-fiction book by Canadian writer [[Tom Harpur]] (1929-2017), a former [[Anglican]] priest, journalist and professor of Greek and New Testament at the [[University of Toronto]], which supports the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hnn.us/article/6641 
"The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?" by W. Ward Gasque&lt;/ref&gt; Harpur claims that the New Testament shares a large number of similarities with ancient Egyptian and other pagan religions, that early Church leaders fabricated a literal and human Jesus based on ancient myths,  and that we should return to an inclusive and universal religion where the spirit of Christ or Christos lives within each of us.

The book was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by both the ''[[Toronto Star]]''  and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. It was later released under the title '''''The Pagan Christ: Is Blind Faith Killing Christianity?''''' in the United States by Walker Books and in Australia by Allen Unwin. It has also been published in five foreign languages: in Montreal (''Le Christ païen'') by Éditions du Boréal, in the Netherlands (''De heidense Christus'') by Ankh-Hermes bv, in Germany (''Der heidnische Heiland'') by Ansata Verlag, in Brazil (''O Cristo Dos Pagaos'') by Editora Cultrix-Pensamento and in Japan (異教キリスト) by Basilico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomharpur.com/books/paganchrist/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomasallen.ca/site/Rights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the book became the basis for a [[#CBC documentary|CBC documentary]], and that same year, Harpur published a more scholarly sequel entitled 
''Water Into Wine: An Empowering Vision of the Gospels''.

==Synopsis==

===Similarities between Christianity and pagan religions===

Throughout the book, Harpur details stories and sayings in the [[New Testament]] which he claims also appear in ancient myths, particularly pointing out the similarities between Jesus and the Egyptian sun god [[Horus]]. He states that a number of pagan cultures in different regions and time periods drew on symbolic themes such as virgin birth, deity father, star in the east, raising of the dead, descent into hell, crucifixion, resurrection, and others. Harpur claims that virtually all words and actions attributed to Jesus in the gospels "originated thousands of years before."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Harpur, ''The Pagan Christ'' (Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2004), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although early church leaders such as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[St. Augustine]] reportedly acknowledged certain commonalities between pagan religions and Christianity, Harpur explains that the extent of these similarities was hidden until the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] in 1799.

===Plagiarism by the early Christian church===

According to Harpur, most modern biblical scholars agree the gospels were written many decades after the presumed death of Jesus, and he concludes the scriptures are inconsistent, inaccurate and do not represent a verifiable historical record. Harpur even makes the case that the original authors of the New Testament set out to combine popular pagan myths with prophecies of the Old Testament, never intending for readers to take these allegorical stories literally. In what he calls "one of the most far-reaching tragedies in history," he presents the case that the Christian church in the third and fourth centuries "made a fatal and fateful error," namely inventing the myth of a literal and historical Jesus based on "sublime truth."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that ultra-conservative [[Christianism|Christianists]] "did everything in their power, through forgery and other fraud, book burning, character assassination, and murder itself, to destroy the crucial evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harpur's sources, their propaganda included selectively editing the scriptures and inserting false passages about Jesus into the text of the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal doubt about historic Jesus===

Asking the question, "can we say with any authority that Jesus of Nazareth actually existed as historical person", he concludes, "I have a very grave doubts we can," adding that his gradual realization that Jesus was a "mythical copy of many preceding saviours" was difficult to accept himself.&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the [[Jesus myth theory]], Harpur contends, "there is no hard historical evidence for Jesus' existence," and "no contemporary non-Christian writer even knew of Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Noting his belief that the [[Pauline epistles]] or letters of [[Saint Paul]] (which were written before the [[gospel|four gospels]]), do not mention the parables and miracles of Christ, and make no reference to biographical details like Nazareth, Harpur concludes, "I am compelled, therefore, by my own independent research to agree that Paul's Christ was not Jesus of Nazareth."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, he states that biblical literalism "commits idolatry by making a flesh-and-blood man into God,"&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and that worshiping a perfect superman with magical powers who supposedly lived 2000 years ago is not a sustainable path for the future of Christianity.

===Continued belief in the divine Christ===

On  Harpur's website and jacket cover, ''The Pagan Christ'' is said to reveal "a cosmic faith built on these truths that the modern church has renounced", and calling for a "return to an inclusive religion where Christ lives within each of us."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomharpur.com/books/paganchrist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harpur, he has spent his entire life searching for answers, and now that he understands the scriptures represent symbolic allegories on a central theme rather than cryptic history, God seems more "relevant and real,"&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; and "the Bible comes alive wholly in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of challenging his religious faith, Harpur attests that his discoveries "have made a joyous and life-changing imprint," which have "transformed my view of the future of Christianity it into one of hope."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The bibliography for ''The Pagan Christ'' contains over 80 published authors who are cited in the book. Harpur has been studying the classics and the Bible since he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in the early 1950s, and he draws on individuals as diverse as [[St. Augustine]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] for supporting quotes. However, he bases many of his arguments on the writings of relatively unknown authors [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] (to whom the book is dedicated), [[Gerald Massey]] and [[Godfrey Higgins]]. He also opens himself to criticism by quoting contemporary atheists such as [[Earl Doherty]] and [[Acharya S]], who are often targeted by biblical literalists and apologists. As for "scholars and critics who believe that Jesus was not historical", Harpur presents a list from American historian [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], that was first published 1929, featuring [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Albert Kalthoff]], [[Arthur Drews]], [[J. C.

==CBC documentary==
In December 2007, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired a documentary called ''The Pagan Christ'', based on Harpur's book, as part of its Doc Zone series.  Filmed by Bank Productions, it was one of the most-watched television documentaries in Canada that year and received mostly favourable comments on the CBC website.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171957/http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp | Harpur's archived afterword, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The program won the Platinumo Remi Award at the [[Houston International Film Festival]] and the Golden Camera Award for best documentary at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California.

''The Pagan Christ'' joins a list of documentaries with sensational claims against orthodox Christianity that have originally aired before either Christmas or Easter, that includes ''Bible Secrets Revealed'' (November to December, 2013) and ''The Lost Tomb of Christ'' (March, 2007).

==Reception==

In a 2004 article entitled "The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?", Vancouver-based pastor W. Ward Gasque strongly critiques ''The Pagan Christ,'' claiming the "evidence for Jesus as a historical personage is incontrovertible."&lt;ref name = "Gasque"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?|url = http://hnn.us/article/6641/|website = hnn.us|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reports that only one of the ten [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]]s who responded to his emails (nine of whom were not identified) were familiar with Kuhn, Higgins and Massey, and that they unanimously dismissed an Egyptian etymology for Jesus.&lt;ref name = "Gasque"/&gt;

Ron Leprohon, Professor of Egyptology at the University of Toronto, has demonstrated that Harpur and his mentor, [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]], were wrong on at least one point. Harpur and Kuhn's claim that the Egyptian deity Horus and Jesus are the same deity is based on faulty syntax. 'In any event, the name 'Iusa' simply does not exist in Egyptian.'&lt;ref&gt;''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea'', Stanley Porter and Stephen Bedard (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73&lt;/ref&gt;

James A. Beverley, author and professor at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, wrote a brief article in 2004 called "The Pagan Tom Harpur" for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, using a more light-hearted tone than the title suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The EFC - The Pagan Tom Harpur|url = http://www.evangelicalfellowship.ca/page.aspx?pid=1747|website = www.evangelicalfellowship.ca|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley E. Porter]] and Stephen J. Bedard offer a refutation of Harpur's ideas from an evangelical standpoint in ''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea''. The 2006 book from Clements Publishing challenges the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter, president and dean of [[McMaster Divinity College]] in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, state, 'If the proponents of the Pagan Christ theory had any evidence even close to the quality of [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]] material, there would be some reason to consider their claims. Unfortunately for their arguments, their evidence lacks substance and the claims are, therefore, shockingly weak.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote "universalistic spirituality". Porter appeared in the CBC documentary, and David Brady Productions approached the authors about creating a counter documentary for Canada's [[VisionTV]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1peter315.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/unmasking-the-pagan-christ-the-documentary/ Stephen Bedard's Hope website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter's colleague at McMaster Divinity College, Gordon L. Heath, also produced a paper called "Neither Scholarly or a Solution" which offers a critique of the book. The author concedes he agrees with Harpur on several points such as their shared aversion to rigid fundamentalism and that the church has done shameful things in the past, but disagrees on most other points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmaster.ca/mjtm/pdfs/MJTM%206.7%20Heath%20on%20Harpur.pdf ''Neither Scholarly Nor A Solution: A Response to Tom Harpur's The Pagan Christ'']. Gordon L. Heath.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, theologian and author [[Robert M. Price]] wrote a review which raised a number of concerns about Harpur's premise and evidence. Price noted that the book "contains many dubious fact claims".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/reviews/harpur_pagan_christ.htm "Tom Harpur, The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light"]. [[Robert M. Price]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart D. Ehrman]] Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] on his ehrmanblog in 2012 and in his book published the same year, [[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|''Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth'']], lists Harpur along with other "mythicists" such as Price, but does not specifically criticize the details in ''The Pagan Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did Jesus Exist?

In 2013, New Testament scholar [[Craig A. Evans]] noted that the views of Harpur and Kuhn have been "thoroughly refuted and is not followed by any reputable historian or Egyptologist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig A. Evans|Evans, Craig A]]. (2012).

'''''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective''''' is a limited-edition [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by &amp;Now Books in 2016.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''There's No Place Like Time: A Retrospective'' masquerades as a catalogue for a real retrospective of experimental films by a non-existent videographer. Author [[Lance Olsen]] and his wife, videographer Andi Olsen, stage the fake retrospective in galleries in Europe and the U.S. The result is a three-dimensional text: a real place dedicated to an unreal career of an artist named Alana Olsen. From her videos and the texts surrounding them (including this catalogue/novel), the viewer/reader is invited to treat her like a fictional character, inferring her character, development, obsessions, and relationship with her daughter, Aila, who allegedly curates the exhibit, but is in fact another fictive character. The catalogue/novel is made up of critical and biographical essays, stills, and reminiscences about Alana's small body of work (fewer than 20 videos over five decades, some of which have  gone missing) produced in relative anonymity, yet apparently a large influence on artists as varied as [[Lars von Trier]], [[Douglas Gordon]], and [[Martin Arnold]].

Thematically, ''There's No Place Like Time,'' then, forms part of a larger [[conceptual art]] installation that investigates the difficulties inherent in identity and knowledge about the past.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Traditional trades''' (known also as '''traditional building trades''' and '''preservation trades''') is a loosely defined categorization of building trades who actively practice their craft in respect of [[historic preservation]], heritage conservation, or the conserving and maintenance of the existing [[built environment]]. Though traditional trade practitioners may at times be involved in new construction, the emphasis of the categorization is toward work on existing structures, regardless of their age or their historic value, with a specific interest in replication or conservation of the original results and craft techniques.

== Trade technologies ==
[[File:Timber Framing Circular Saw.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Modern timber framers incorporate new technologies, like the circular saw shown here, to increase productivity and reduce labor costs and time.]]Traditional building trades commonly include [[masonry]], [[timber framing]], log building, traditional [[Roofer|roofing]], [[carpentry]] and [[joiner]]y, [[plasterwork]], [[painting]], [[blacksmithing]], and ornamental metal working. In addition to "hands-on" skills and knowledge of building processes, traditional trade practitioners incorporate knowledge of historic preservation, materials science, historic architecture, and procuring replacement materials. Contemporary practitioners of traditional trades must also avail themselves of modern technologies, current materials science, and 21st century construction project management.

The work performed by these practitioners is not only essential to the maintenance of the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, lime burners, and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be “dying” arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, it is also true that these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all.

Traditional trades not only restore and help to maintain buildings, but also stabilize priceless archaeological sites, and in doing so, help us understand the techniques used at places like [[Cuzco]], [[Stonehenge]], and [[Angkor Wat]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Such trades are not solely practiced for the conservation of monumental heritage sites and can be applied to conserve vernacular sites such as barns.

== Materials technologies ==
The traditional trades focus on preservation of the knowledge of craft work specific to historic building technologies and traditional/non-traditional building materials. Traditional building materials and traditional trade technologies are commonly associated with a host of materials, but not limited to, stone, brick, [[terra cotta]], [[adobe]], cork, leather, timber and log, bamboo, thatch, [[slate]] and metal roofing, fine and vernacular carpentry, ornamental [[plaster]] ([[scagliola]]), [[stained glass]], window and door restoration, wood refinishing, painting, [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]]. In what may at times be considered non-traditional materials are found trades such as chandelier and lighting restoration where you have to be somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades with an understanding of electricity, and knowledgeable with properties and finishes of metals, glass, and optics. As an example of the mix of new and old materials, the art of restoration of mobile residential trailers requires a number of traditional trade skills associated with traditional and contemporary materials in a manner not dissimilar to those hand-work skills and preservation approaches required to restore an historic automobile, a biplane, rocket ship or steam locomotive.

== Green trades ==
Traditional building technologies tend towards a closer relationship of the built environment to an in-practice understanding, interaction and use of [[natural resources]] and recycled or salvaged building materials than is common in the practice of modern and contemporary building technologies.

For example: a traditional timber framer in search of difficult-to-acquire materials with which to rebuild heritage structures will tend to seek out an understanding of forest management, tree harvest, conversion process and building design and technique. These integrated skills and their supportive knowledge base both in scale and localization are readily adaptable to strategies of sustainable new-build economies.

Old buildings and structures were built once, energy and natural resources previously expended, and to adaptively re-use or recycle them often requires an understanding and appreciation of not only how the older materials with which they were built work together in a structure, but a need to understand the techniques by which these materials were originally worked, and an understanding of how they can most optimally be worked now.

== Knowledge of process ==
As opposed to an emphasis on [[materials science]] (as with an [[architectural conservator]]) the primary orientation of a traditional trade practitioner tends toward the in-process work activity and physical interaction and intervention with the building materials and the coordination, education and [[project management]] of in-field work teams.

== Team members ==
Traditional trades are quite often team members with architectural conservators, preservation architects and structural engineers in both the design phase investigation of heritage sites as well as involved directly in the undertaking of the hands-on restoration process. Traditional trades as a resource to the historic preservation industry provide a physical grounding in feasibility, construction logic, field and site logistics, reference to skilled traditional trades practitioners, estimate and budget considerations.

== Availability ==

Skilled traditional trades practitioners are generally available to preservationists and property stewards who give themselves a chance to find them. Besides the Internet and verbal networking, information about traditional trades can be found through trade associations and training programs, both private and governmental. If a particular job is limited to union workers, the union should provide workers with the appropriate skills or else allow an exception for a particular task.

A traditional trades practitioner may also be able to recommend experts in related skills, as well as promote good communications among the different disciplines at work on any given project.

== Education ==
Basic levels of training in contemporary building and craft skills are a prerequisite to specialization in traditional trades work. Individuals with an interest in learning a traditional trade can seek out learning opportunities either through formal vocational programs or through informal mentorship in at-work field practice under the tutelage of a traditional trade practitioner.

Family businesses, trade unions, historic preservation businesses, government programs ([http://www.nps.gov/training/HPTC/ National Park Service Historic Preservation Training Center]), college programs, religious and non-profit organizations are areas where an interest to provide education of traditional trade practice can often be found. As the individual increases in skill, learning will come from study, from workshops, from travel and personal contacts, and from clues found in the work itself.

Some individual tradespeople provide training opportunities for their fellow tradespeople without a close association with the larger educational institutions.

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names. 
&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Kugler, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel - II. Buch: Natur, Mythus und Geschichte als Grundlagen babylonischer Zeitordnung, nebst eingehenden Untersuchungen der älteren Sternkunde und Meteorologie, 2. Teil. Heft 1, Aschendorff, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V.

Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D. Weir, The Pattern of Venus Tablet Solutions, JACF, vol. 7, pp.70-76, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G.

Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
