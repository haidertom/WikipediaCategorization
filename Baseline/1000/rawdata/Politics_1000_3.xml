The '''1975 Brussels summit''' was the third [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] took place on 29–30 May 1975.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;[http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas  NATO summit meetings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was only the third meeting of the NATO heads of state following the ceremonial signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on 4 April 1949.&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R.

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced a generational challenge; and the unresolved questions concerned whether  a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.&lt;ref name="thomas101"/&gt;

==Agenda==
The general discussions focused on the need for affirming of the fundamental importance of the Alliance,  Other topics included, 
* Allied cohesion in the face of international economic pressures following the 1974 oil crisis; and
* Support for successful conclusion of negotiations in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

The '''altruism theory of voting''' is a model of '''[[Voting behavior|voter behavior]]''' which states that if citizens in a democracy have “social” preferences for the welfare of others, the extremely low probability of a single vote determining an [[election]] will be outweighed by the large cumulative benefits society will receive from the voter’s preferred policy being enacted, such that it is rational for an “altruistic” citizen, who receives '''[[utility]]''' from helping others, to vote.&lt;ref name="Edlin"&gt;Edlin, Aaron, Andrew Gelman, and Noah Kaplan. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0x3780rb "Voting as a Rational Choice: Why and How People Vote To Improve the Well-Being of Others."] Rationality and Society. 19.3 (2008): 293–314. Web. 22 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic voting has been compared to purchasing a lottery ticket, in which the probability of winning is extremely low but the payoff is large enough that the ''expected'' benefit outweighs the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, Richard. [http://rss.sagepub.com/content/14/1/55.short "Buying a Lottery Ticket to Help the Poor: Altruism, Civic Duty, and Self-interest in the Decision to Vote."] Rationality and Society 14.1 (2002): 55–77. Sage Journals. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the failure of standard '''[[rational choice]]''' models—which assume voters have "selfish" preferences—to explain [[voter turnout]] in large elections, '''[[public choice]]''' economists and social scientists have increasingly turned to [[altruism]] as a way to explain why rational individuals would choose to vote despite its apparent lack of individual benefit, the so-called '''[[paradox of voting]]'''. The theory suggests that individual voters do, in fact, derive personal utility from influencing the ''outcome'' of elections in favor of the candidate that they believe will implement policies for the greater good of the entire population.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, James H. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4639889 "Altruism and Turnout."] The Journal of Politics 68.3 (2006): 673–83. JSTOR. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rational calculus of voting==

===The "selfish" rationale for voting===
The standard model of voter calculus was articulated by [[William H. Riker|Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook|Ordeshook]] in their 1968 article "A Theory of the Calculus of Voting" in ''[[The American Political Science Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Riker, William H., and Peter Ordeshook. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1953324 "A Theory of the Calculus of Voting."] The American Political Science Review 62.1 (1968): 25–42. JSTOR. Web. 20 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic utility hypothesis for the calculus of voting they gave was:

:&lt;big&gt;'''R = (BP) − C''' &lt;/big&gt;

Where '''B''' is the expected differential utility a voter ''personally'' receives from his preferred candidate winning; '''P''' is the probability of the voter bringing about '''B''' (that is, turning the election for his preferred candidate); '''C''' is the individual's cost of voting in the election; and R is the individuals expected reward from voting. If R &gt; 0, then the expected utility of voting outweighs its costs, and it is reasonable to vote. But if R ≤ 0, the costs outweigh the benefits and a strictly rational individual would not be expected to vote.

Because '''P''', the probability of any one vote determining the outcome, is extremely small for any large election, the expected benefits of voting under the traditional rational choice model is always roughly equal to zero. This leads to the so-called paradox of voting, in which rational choice models of voter behavior predict tiny turnouts which simply do not occur. In all democracies, [[voter turnout]] exceeds what the basic rational choice models predict.

====Expressive versus instrumental voting====
Because simple selfishness cannot explain why large numbers of people consistently choose to vote, Riker and Ordeshook introduced another term to the equation, '''D''', to symbolize the personal or social benefits conferred by the act of voting itself, rather than by affecting the outcome of the election.

:&lt;big&gt;'''R = (BP) − C + D''' &lt;/big&gt;

This drew a distinction between ''[[expressive voting]]'', intended only to signal support or demonstrate civic responsibility, and ''instrumental voting'', intended to actually change the outcome. The benefits here did not come from actually influencing the election, but rather from the social payoffs of participating in it. Because the term BP was assumed to be zero, D was presumed to be the only important factor in determining elections.&lt;ref name="Hamlin"&gt;Hamlin , Alan, and Colin Jennings. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8286059 "Expressive Political Behaviour: Foundations, Scope and Implications."] British Journal of Political Science. 41.3 (2011): 645–670. Web. 22 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "altruistic" rationale for voting===
Because of the multitude of different and contradictory definitions of expressive voting,&lt;ref name="Hamlin" /&gt; recently another effort by political scientists and public choice theorists has been made to explain voting behavior with reference to instrumental benefits received from influencing the outcome of the election. If voters assumed to be rational but also to have altruistic tendencies and some preference for outcomes enhancing the social welfare of others, they will reliably vote in favor of the policies they perceive to be for the common good, rather than for their individual benefit.

In his paper "Altruism and Turnout," [[James H. Fowler]] explained how the altruistic theory modified the calculus of voting:

:Scholars incorporate altruism into the traditional calculus of voting model by assuming that a citizen also cares about the benefits that others secure from the preferred outcome (Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan 2006; Jankowski 2002, 2004). Under this assumption, B is a function not only of direct benefits to oneself BS, but to the N other people affected by the outcome of the election who would gain an average benefit BO if the citizen’s preferred alternative won. It also depends on how much the citizen cares about benefits to others, which is labeled a for altruism.
:These assumptions transform the calculus of voting to '''P(BS + aNBO) &gt; C'''.
:...There is by now a substantial literature in economics, sociology, biology, psychology, and political science yielding evidence that human beings are also motivated by the welfare of others (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Monroe 1998; Piliavin and Charng 1990). Specifically, people frequently engage in acts of altruism by choosing to bear costs in order to provide benefits to others.&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;

Essentially, voters behave altruistically by absorbing the cost of voting in order to provide society with the benefits of their preferred policy, although the expected reward of voting under this model is greater than zero (and thus still a rational decision) because of voters' altruistic social preferences. Edlin, et al., found in their study of altruistic behavior among voters,

:... [F]or an individual with both selfish and social preferences, the social preferences will dominate and make it rational for a typical person to vote even in large elections;(2) to show that rational socially-motivated voting has a feedback mechanism that stabilizes turnout at reasonable levels (e.g., 50% of the electorate)...

Their findings suggest that in a large election, altruistic preferences will trump selfish tendencies, thus encouraging a stable voter turnout that closely mirrors the observed rate in western democracies.

==Voter's altruistic preferences==
In his 2007 book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies]]'', [[George Mason University]] economist [[Bryan Caplan]] argued that, all else equal, voters do not, in fact, choose policies based on self-interest. The rich are not more likely to support policies that personally benefit them, like lower marginal rates, and the poor are not more likely to oppose welfare reform.&lt;ref name="Caplan"&gt;Bryan Caplan. [http://amzn.com/0691138737 The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies], Princeton University Press, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims that what he calls the "Self-Interest Voter Hypothesis" (SIVH), the theory that individuals' policy preferences are narrowly selfish, is empirically wrong. In response to U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s remarks about [[Romney 47 percent comments|the "47%" of Americans]] who will "always" vote Democrat because they are dependent on the [[welfare state]], Caplan writes,

:Wrong, wrong, wrong.  The 47% won't vote for Obama "no matter what."  Almost half of voters who earn less than the median income vote Republican in the typical election.  A person doesn't support the nanny state because he wants government to take care of ''him''; a person supports the nanny state because he wants government to take care of ''us''.&lt;ref name="EconLog"&gt;Caplan, Bryan. "Will False Belief in the SIVH Destroy Romney's Candidacy?" EconLog. Library of Economics and Liberty, 18 Sept. 2012. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caplan says that voters consistently demonstrate preferences that are not clearly related to self-interest, and they are motivated primarily by what they believe is best for the country.

===Rational irrationality===
Related to the public choice concept of [[rational ignorance]], Caplan proposes the concept of "[[rational irrationality]]" as an explanation for why the average voter holds views that are persistently and systematically contradictory to the consensus view of expert economists. His thesis is that indulging innate cognitive biases (of which he identifies four as being major contributors to bad economic policy positions) is psychologically gratifying, while overcoming natural prejudices through training, education, and [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]], is psychologically costly. Therefore, when the personal benefit giving in to our biases is greater than the personal cost suffered from acting on them, individuals will tend to ''rationally'' indulge in irrational behavior, like voting for protectionist tariffs and other economically damaging but socially popular policies.

These views tend not to be related to the particular voter in any rationally self-interested way, and so voters are genuinely not being subject to any direct economic penalties for choosing irrational policies. The altruistic voter will indulge, without restraint, in make-work bias, anti-foreign bias, pessimistic bias, and anti-market bias,&lt;ref name="Caplan" /&gt; all in the hopes of better his fellow man through the ballot box.

==Criticisms and modifications==
* A 2008 study of voters in Sweden during the 1990s found significant evidence for self-interested "pocketbook" voting. The authors found that voters can and will respond to direct promises of personal economic benefits, although it appears that citizens respond almost entirely to the ''prospective promises'' of politicians but ''not'' to the actual implementation of those policies.&lt;ref&gt;Elinder , Mikael, Henrik Jordahl, and Panu Poutvaara. [http://ftp.iza.org/dp3763.pdf "Selfish and Prospective: Theory and Evidence of Pocketbook Voting."] Institute for the Study of Labor Discussion Paper Series. 3763 (2008): n. page. Web. 22 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Mason Law Professor Tun-Jen Chiang criticized the Edlin altruist model as overly simplistic and ultimately naive about voter preferences. Chiang presents an alternative model of altruist voting behavior, centered around voters' ''selective'' altruism towards favored racial, cultural, religious, regional, sexual, economic, or social groups (of which they may or may not be a member). He contends that, even if two candidates policies had identical social welfare benefits overall,

::It is rational to vote as long as the candidates differ in their effect on the welfare of subsets of the population, and one happens to be particularly concerned with an affected subset. For example, if a candidate proposed to take wealth from the richer half of the population and distribute it to the poorer half, and the redistribution created no overall effects, a voter under the broad altruism model would have no incentive to vote. However, if a voter cared particularly for the welfare of the poor, that voter would have an incentive to vote for the candidate; similarly, a voter that cared particular for the welfare of the rich would have an incentive to vote against the candidate. The result in my model is that both such voters would be rationally motivated to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Tun-Jen. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2035566 "Unequal Altruism and the Voting Paradox."] George Mason University Law and Economics Research Paper Series. 12–36 (2012): n. page.

'''Christian existentialism''' is a theo-philosophical movement which takes an [[existentialism|existentialist]] approach to Christian theology. The school of thought is often traced back to the work of the [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher and theologian [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855).  &lt;ref&gt;M.J. Eliade &amp; C.J. Adams (1987). ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' (v.5). Macmillan Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existential approach to Christian theology has a long and diverse history including Augustine, Aquinas, Pascal and Maritain.

==Kierkegaardian themes==
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Søren Kierkegaard]]
Christian existentialism relies on Kierkegaard's understanding of [[Christianity]].  Kierkegaard argued that the [[universe]] is fundamentally [[paradox]]ical, and that its greatest paradox is the transcendent union of God and humans in the person of [[Jesus Christ]]. He also posited having a personal relationship with God that supersedes all prescribed moralities, social structures and communal norms,&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1846). ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', authored pseudonymously as Johannes Climacus.&lt;/ref&gt; since he asserted that following social conventions is essentially a personal aesthetic choice made by individuals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Kierkegaard proposed that each person must make independent choices, which then constitute his existence. Each person suffers from the anguish of indecision (whether knowingly or unknowingly) until he commits to a particular choice about the way to live. Kierkegaard also proposed three rubrics with which to understand the conditions that issue from distinct life choices: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.

==Major premises==
One of the major premises of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism [[logical consequence|entails]] calling the masses back to a more genuine form of Christianity. This form is often identified with some notion of [[Early Christianity]], which mostly existed during the first three centuries after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Beginning with the [[Edict of Milan]], which was issued by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] in AD 313, Christianity enjoyed a level of popularity among [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and later among other [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. And yet Kierkegaard asserted that by the 19th century, the ultimate meaning of [[New Testament]] Christianity ([[Charity (virtue)|love]], cf. [[agape]], [[mercy]] and [[Chesed|loving-kindness]]) had become perverted, and Christianity had deviated considerably from its original threefold message of grace, humility, and love.

Another major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism involves Kierkegaard's conception of God and [[Love]]. For the most part, Kierkegaard equates God with Love.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1849). ''The Sickness Unto Death'' Trans. Alastair Hannay (New York: Penguin Books, 2004), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a person engages in the act of loving, he is in effect achieving an aspect of the [[divinity|divine]]. Kierkegaard also viewed the [[individual]] as a necessary synthesis of both [[Wikt:finite|finite]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] elements. Therefore, when an individual does not come to a full realization of his infinite side, he is said to be in [[wikt:despair|despair]]. For many contemporary Christian [[theologians]], the notion of despair can be viewed as [[sin]]. However, to Kierkegaard, a man sinned when he was exposed to this idea of despair and chose a path other than one in accordance with [[Providentialism|God's will]].

A final major premise of Kierkegaardian Christian existentialism entails the systematic undoing of [[evil]] acts. Kierkegaard asserted that once an action had been completed, it should be evaluated in the face of God, for holding oneself up to divine scrutiny was the only way to judge one's actions. Because actions constitute the manner in which something is deemed good or bad, one must be constantly conscious of the potential consequences of his actions. Kierkegaard believed that the choice for [[good and evil|goodness]] ultimately came down to each individual. Yet Kierkegaard also foresaw the potential limiting of choices for individuals who fell into [[The Sickness Unto Death|despair]].&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1849). ''The Sickness Unto Death'' Trans. Alastair Hannay (New York: Penguin Books, 2004), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bible==
Christian Existentialism often refers to what it calls the '''indirect style''' of Christ's teachings, which it considers to be a distinctive and important aspect of his ministry.  Christ's point, it says, is often left unsaid in any particular parable or saying, to permit each individual to confront the truth on his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald D. Palmer]] (1996). ''Kierkegaard For Beginners''. London, England: Writers And Readers Limited. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly evident in (but is certainly not limited to) his [[parable]]s; for example in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] ({{bibleverse|Matthew|18:21-35|NIV}}). 
A good example of '''indirect communication''' in the Old Testament is the story of [[David]] and [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:1-14}}.

An existential reading of the Bible demands that the reader recognize that he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], studying the words that God communicates to him personally. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" which are outside and unrelated to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Howard V. Hong (1983). "Historical Introduction" to ''Fear and Trembling''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing them upon him, but as though they are inside him and guiding him internally. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life, or the learner who should put it to use?"&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1847). ''Works of Love''. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Existentially speaking, the Bible doesn't become an authority in a person's life until he ''permits'' the Bible to be his personal authority.

==Notable Christian existentialists==
Christian existentialists include German Protestant theologians [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rudolph Bultmann]], American existential psychologist [[Rollo May]] (who introduced much of Tillich's thought to a general American readership), British Anglican theologian [[John Macquarrie]], American theologian Lincoln Swain,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Swain (2005). [http://www.somareview.com/contributors.cfm?authorID=75 Five Articles], ''Soma: A Review of Religion and Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Clifford Williams (academic)|Clifford Williams]], French Catholic philosophers [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Emmanuel Mounier]], and [[Pierre Boutang]], German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno]], and Russian philosophers [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] and [[Lev Shestov]]. [[Karl Barth]] added to Kierkegaard's ideas the notion that existential despair leads an individual to an awareness of God's infinite nature. Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] could be placed within the tradition of Christian existentialism.

The roots of existentialism have been traced back as far as St [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R. Lewis (Winter 1965). [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bets/vol08/8-1_lewis.pdf "Augustine and Existentialism"]. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 8,1, pp. 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michial Farmer (6 July 2010). [http://www.christianhumanist.org/chb/a-primer-on-religious-existentialism-pt-4-augustine/ "A Primer on Religious Existentialism, Pt. 4: Augustine"]. christianhumanist.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig J. N. de Paulo, ed. (2006). ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of An Augustinian Phenomenology''. Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most striking passages in [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s ''[[Pensées]]'', including the famous section on the [[Pascal's Wager|Wager]], deal with existentialist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Clarke (2011). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal/ "Blaise Pascal"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Williams (July 3, 2005). [http://www.cliffordwilliams.net/pascal "Pascal"]. cliffordwilliams.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michial Farmer (20 July 2010).

[http://www.christianhumanist.org/chb/a-primer-on-religious-existentialism-pt-6-apologetics/ "A Primer on Religious Existentialism, Pt. 6: Apologetics"]. christianhumanist.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Maritain]], in ''Existence and the Existent: An Essay on Christian Existentialism'',&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Maritain (1947). ''Existence and the Existent: An Essay on Christian Existentialism'' (''Court traité de l'existence et de l'existent''), translated by Lewis Galantiere and Gerald B. Phelan. New York: Pantheon Books, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; finds the core of true existentialism in the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

== Radical Existential Christianity ==

It has been claimed that Radical Existential Christians’ faith is based in their sensible and immediate and direct experience of God indwelling in human terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Existing Christ: an Existential Christology|last=Di Giovanni|first=Aldo|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2014|isbn=9781503134911|location=Charlston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that individuals do not make or create their Christian existence; it does not come as a result of a decision one personally makes. The radical Protestants of the 17th century, [[Inward light|for example Quakers]] may have been in some ways theo-philosophically aligned with radical existential Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5042">A '''Citizens’ Initiative Review''' (CIR) is modeled on the [[Citizens’ jury]] and is a form of [[deliberative democracy]].  A panel of citizens meets to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will be deciding in an upcoming election.  The panelists are chosen through means such as [[random sampling]] and [[stratified sampling]] to be demographically representative of the relevant population.  To ensure that the panel is a manageable size for face-to-face deliberation, a CIR caps the number of participants at around two dozen.  They are often paid for their time and travel so that the broadest possible range of citizens can participate.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, only the state of Oregon has passed a law to enact a permanent version of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt; The states of Colorado, Arizona, and Massachusetts have conducted pilot tests of the CIR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirmass2016.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpr.org/news/story/experiment-help-voters-understand-colorado-ballot-measures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/files/2015/01/CIR-2016-Arizona-Report-26npu2z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The operations of a CIR are typically assisted by a moderator who is trained to ensure that all panelists engage in the deliberations.  Over the course of a few days, the panelists not only deliberate among themselves but also question policy experts and advocates on both sides of the initiative.  The panelists write a statement describing their deliberations in a form that can be publicized though means such as including it in the voter’s pamphlet.  This statement summarizes what the panelists believed were the best arguments pro and con, and it lists the number of panelists who recommended voting both for and against the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Richards, “Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizens-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Consistent with other forms of deliberative democracy, a CIR tries to strengthen the quality and impact of the public voice in elections and government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.natcom.org/communication-currents/evaluating-new-governing-institution-assessment-citizens%E2%80%99-initiative-review&lt;/ref&gt;  The CIR addresses specific concerns about initiative campaigns where voters often receive little information at all, or else what they hear—for example, from paid advertisements—is biased or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;John Gastil, “Beyond Endorsements and Partisan Cues:  Given Voters Viable Alternaties to Unreliable Cognitive Shortcuts” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Gastil-2014-Beyond-Endorsements-and-Partisan-Cues-Giving-Vote.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Under a CIR, voters learn what a representative body of citizens thought about the initiative after studying it carefully and deliberating among themselves.  

==Evaluation==
Academic research shows that the panelists in the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review have achieved high-quality deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Justin Reedy, and Katherine Cramer Walsh, “Did They Deliberate? Applying an Evaluative Model of Democratic Deliberation to the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/DidTheyDeliberate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Voters became aware of those deliberations through the voters’ pamphlet and found the panelists’ statement to be helpful to their decisions, and voter knowledge about the initiatives increased as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch, John Gastil, Traci Feller, and Robert C. Richards, “Empowering Citizen Deliberation in Direct Democratic Elections: A Field Study of the 2012 Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review” http://factsreports.revues.org/3448&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists themselves developed new attitudes about the political process and their own capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Knobloch and John Gastil, “Civic (Re)socialisation: The Educative Effects of Deliberative Participation” http://sites.psu.edu/citizensinitiativereview/wp-content/uploads/sites/23162/2015/01/Civic-resocialization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Informing the voting public of what the panelists recommended, rather than just summarizing the pro and con arguments that panelists found most persuasive, may short-circuit voters’ own deliberations by allowing them to simply adopt the panelists’ recommendation. &lt;ref&gt;James Fishkin, "Deliberation by the People Themselves:  Entry Points for the Public Voice" http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2013.0200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Collaborative E-democracy2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a collaborative e-democracy every citizen participates in the policy process, either indirectly, by delegating proxy representatives to vote on their behalf within the different policy domains, or directly, by voting on a particular issue (green arrows).]]

'''Collaborative e-democracy''' or '''super-democracy''' is a democratic conception that combines key features of [[direct democracy]], [[representative democracy]], and [[e-democracy]] (i.e. the use of [[Information and communication technology|ICTs]] for democratic processes). The concept was first published at two international academic conferences in 2009 (see below).

Collaborative e-democracy refers to a [[political system]] in which governmental stakeholders ([[politicians]]/[[political party|parties]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] etc.) and non-governmental stakeholders ([[NGO]]s, [[lobbying|political lobbies]], local communities, individual [[citizens]], etc.) collaborate on the development of public [[law]]s and [[policy|policies]]. This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental [[social networking site]] in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making).

While directly elected [[government officials]] (i.e. [[Liquid democracy#Delegated voting|‘proxy representatives’]]) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final [[voting]] power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable ([[initiative]]). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.

==Theoretical background==
Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components:
* '''‘Collaborative democracy’''', a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collaborative-democracy.com/cdDefinition.cfm www.collaborative-democracy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/cdn/ Collaborative Democracy Network], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''‘Collaborative e-policymaking’''' (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase [[Policy#Policy cycle|policy process]] in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] &lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. ], JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/ Collaborative Policy], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian National University, ANU E Press; [http://epress.anu.edu.au/anzsog/collab_gov/mobile_devices/index.html Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia?]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Proxy voting]] and [[delegative democracy]]''': Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.&lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556176.1556222 "Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making."], [http://www.dgrc.org/ Digital Government Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy process==
Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws &amp; policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; [[domain expert]]s; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives).

* '''Suggestion &amp; ranking phase''': Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy [[crowdsourcing]]). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others.
* '''Evaluation phase''': For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts.
* '''Voting phase''': Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed.
* '''Revision phase''': A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved.
To be clear, CPM is automated as a [[Process (computing)|software process]] that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.

==Principles==
Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles:
* '''[[Self-government]]''', the ideal of direct democracy, and “''quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur''”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “''that which affects all people must be approved by all people''”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies ([[Corporatocracy]]).
* '''[[Open source governance]]''', a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open source]] and [[open content]] movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy.
* '''Aggregation''': One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad-hoc groups to address these issues.
* '''[[Collaboration]]''': Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other.
* '''[[Collective intelligence]]''': The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of [[Web 2.0]].
* '''Collective learning &amp; Adoption''': The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oreilly.com/catalog/web2report/chapter/web20_report_excerpt.pdf O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits &amp; limitations==
The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following '''benefits''':
* '''[[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] and accessibility''': The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet.
* '''[[Political efficacy]]''': Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the [[democratic deficit]].
* '''[[Deliberative democracy|Deliberation]]''': The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information &amp; communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation.
* '''Collective awareness''': Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation’s collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies.

On the contrary the concept has several '''limitations''':
* '''[[Constitution]]al limits''': Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective.
* '''[[Digital divide]]''': People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded.
* '''[[Majority rule]]''': Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy.
* '''[[Naive]]ty''':  Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options.  This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will.  However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem.  Increased education, [[critical thinking]] and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.

==Research &amp; development==
In 2009 the two conceptions, ''collaborative e-democracy'' and ''collaborative e-policy-making'', were  first published at two [[academic conference]]s on [[e-governance]] and [[e-democracy]]:
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making”''; the [http://dgo2009.pbworks.com/ 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: "Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data &amp; Government"] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]];
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”'';  [http://edem2009.ocg.at/ The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* A third publication appears in the [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government", Vol 2, No 1 (2010)].

Current research is conducted at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] where a [[Prototype#Computer programming.2Fcomputer science|prototype]] software for  collaborative e-policymaking is being developed. The software will be featured on an independent web 2.0 platform with open participation; the volunteer participants will be facilitated to collaboratively develop Australian public laws and policies by proceeding through the phases of the CPM process. The start of the trialling period is probably 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/klaus/ QUT Urban Informatics Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Corngate'''" was a political [[scandal]] which took place in [[New Zealand]] in 2002 and involved the suspected release of [[genetically modified maize]] (corn) seed in 2000. 

==Background==
The possibility of the presence of a small percentage of GE corn in a seed shipment from the [[United States|U.S.]] was raised publicly by [[Nicky Hager]] in his book ''[[Seeds of Distrust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hager|first=Nicky|title=Seeds of Distrust|publisher=Craig Potton Publishing|location=Nelson, N.Z. |year=2002|isbn=0-908802-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage was found well after sowing to be above "allowable limits" of contamination - the allowable limit being zero as the question of the accidental presence of GE content or the unreliability of low level testing had not been considered. The results showing GE contamination were later seen as being a PCR artifact, likely being due to contamination of the samples rather than the corn.

It became politically important due to the [[New Zealand Green Party]] stance on [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops. The ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] policy regarding GE research was brought into the argument allowing Corngate to become an election issue as the book, ''Seeds of Distrust'' was released a few months prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 Parliamentary elections]].

A [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], including members of the Green Party, was formed to investigate the matter. Green Party statements claim the committee was "obstructed" by [[Syngenta]] refusing to release test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Notes on the select committee's "Corngate" report| work =| publisher =| date =2007-10-19| url =http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| doi =| accessdate =2007-11-27| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063851/http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| archivedate =2012-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report, released in late 2004, was inconclusive due to a lack of clear evidence, poor reporting in the original incident and the deletion of raw data critical for a full re-evaluation. Scientific assessment highlighted a lack of rigor in the testing procedures at that time and noted failures in the administration and interpretation of the results by the regulatory body, the [[Environmental Risk Management Authority]] (ERMA).

The incident also highlighted the problems of testing for the presence of GMOs down to a regulatory level of zero when all available detection methods have a relatively high base threshold before results become unreliable.   

The scandal was further intensified when news anchor [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] interviewed Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] about the issue.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dET78Z5b5s Campbell Live video interview with Prime Minister Helen Clark on GE]&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with Clark labelling Campbell a "sanctimonious little creep" due to what she considered the ambush style of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME1vBrTXNFwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22John+Campbell%22+%22Little+creep%22|title=Voters' Veto: The 2002 Election in New Zealand and the Consolidation of Minority Government|isbn=1-86940-309-6|pages=36|first=Jack|last=Vowles|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) later ruled that the infamous "Corngate" interview was unbalanced, unfair and lacked impartiality and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authority Releases Decision On 3 News Special|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0307/S00032.htm|work=Scoop: Politics, 4 July 2003|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corngate is one of many [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|scandals suffixed with "-gate"]], ultimately originating from the [[Watergate scandal]] in U.S. politics.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt;Cultural conservatism&lt;noinclude&gt;'''&lt;/noinclude&gt; is described as the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Cultural conservatism, political liberalism: from criticism to cultural studies''] by James Seaton, University of Michigan Press, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-472-10645-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-10645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other variants of cultural conservatism are concerned with culture attached to a given language such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].

The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]].

Cultural conservatism is distinct from [[social conservatism]], although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives believe that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation. Social conservatives generally view any social change as suspect, rather than just those related to culture or cultural tradition.

==United States==
In the US, ''cultural conservative'' may imply a conservative position in the [[culture wars]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

An example of a cultural conservative in the broader sense is [[Allan Bloom]], arguing in ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' against [[cultural relativism]]. Another example is Senator [[Jim Webb]] (D-Virginia), author of ''[[Born Fighting]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Main|Foreign relations of China}}

Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has had a diplomatic tug-of-war with its rival in [[Taiwan]], the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). Throughout the [[Cold War]], both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all China and allowed countries to recognize either one or the other. Until the 1970s, most Western countries recognized the ROC while the communist bloc and third world countries generally recognized the PRC. This gradually shifted and today only {{Numrec|ROC||UN member states recognize the ROC}} while the PRC is recognized by the [[United Nations]], 176 UN member states and 1 UN observer around the world. Both the ROC and the PRC maintain the requirement of recognizing its view of the [[One-China policy]] to establish or maintain diplomatic relations.

[[Image:PRC relations commencement.svg|425px|right|thumb|Countries of the world indicating decade diplomatic relations commenced with the PRC: 1949/1950s (dark red), 1960s (red), 1970s (orange), 1980s (beige) and 1990s/2000s (yellow). Countries not recognised by or not recognising the PRC are in grey. The PRC itself is in black.]]

==Recognition of the PRC before it was seated at the UN==

===1949===
The PRC was established on 1 October 1949, when the [[Chinese Civil War]] was still underway, and the seat of Government of the [[Republic of China]] was not relocated to Taipei until December 1949. All the countries that recognized the new PRC government in 1949 were [[communist state]]s.

==Recognition of the PRC after it was seated at the UN==
The Republic of China, which had occupied [[China and the United Nations|China's seat at the United Nations]] since 1945, was effectively expelled on 25 October 1971. Its seat was taken over by the People's Republic of China from 15 November 1971, and the migration of relations to the PRC soon followed among members of the [[Western Bloc]], except for the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy and the [[Scandinavia]]n Countries which had previously established diplomatic relations.

An '''emperor''' (through [[Old French]] ''empereor'' from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[imperator]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|emperor|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[monarch]], and usually the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] ruler of an [[empire]] or another type of imperial realm. '''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as Emperor.

Both emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation, therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/south-east-se-asia/china-art/a/forbidden-city|title=The Forbidden City|last=Peng|first=Dr. Ying-chen|date=|website=Khan Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts—the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared Empress of India.

In [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of ''{{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}'', i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. Although technically an elective title, by the late [[16th century]] the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used ''translatio imperii'' to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.

Historians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] "empires" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such "empires" did not need to be headed by an "emperor". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.

For purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns—whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents—is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.

==Roman tradition==

In the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the "Empire" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.

The importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as "king") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.

Early [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.

Rules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.

==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==

===Classical Antiquity===
{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}
[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]

When [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex ("king")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]
[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', ("first man of the Senate") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' ("first citizen") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC – 284 AD, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' ("commander") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)

Beginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:

*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became "[[Kaiser]]"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became "[[Tsar]]"; in Hungarian it became "[[Császár]]", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] "Caesar": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.
*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like "elevated" or "sublime", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no "title" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.
*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant "(military) commander". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter "Imperator" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to "Emperor" in English and, among other examples, "Empereur" in French and "Mbreti" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after "Imperator" had taken on the connotation of "Emperor".
*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (Αὐτοκράτωρ) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (βασιλεύς): although the Greeks used equivalents of "Caesar" (Καῖσαρ, ''Kaisar'') and "Augustus" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|Αὔγουστος}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|Σεβαστός}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|αὐτοκράτωρ}} (''autokratōr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of "[[Autocracy|autocrat]]") or {{lang|grc|βασιλεύς}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for "[[Monarch|sovereign]]"). ''Autokratōr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokratōr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept ("the one with unlimited power"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of "emperor" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.

After the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].

During the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.

The [[Principate]] (27 BC – 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD – 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.

===Byzantine period===
{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}

====Before the 4th Crusade====
[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]

Historians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].

These Later Roman "Byzantine" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was "King" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word "autokrator", meaning "one who rules himself", or "monarch", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.

In general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply "emperor" (''basileus''), to "emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 9th century, to "emperor and autocrat of the Romans" (''basileus kai autokratōr tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 10th.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], "Avtokrator i samodržac", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95–187&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.

One important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306–337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of "emperor" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].

The Byzantine empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].

====Latin emperors====
In 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new "Empire of Romania", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.

====After the 4th Crusade====
With Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, the Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who then recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trebizond emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[Süleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.&lt;/ref&gt; Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968.

It was crowned with an enormous feather.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rulers]] held several titles denoting their Imperial status. These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman empire by right of conquest.  The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states — and therefore rival claimants — over the next eight years.  Though the term "emperor" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.

==Holy Roman Empire==
{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}
The ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east.

From the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.

==Austrian Empire==
{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}
The first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''König''), in name.

The title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the "[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum Österreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as "emperordom" (on analogy with "kingdom") or "emperor-ship"; the term denotes specifically "the territory ruled by an emperor", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the "Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.

==Emperors of Europe==
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.

===Bulgaria===
In 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.

Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914–924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title "Emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn''), was eventually recognized, as "Emperor of the Bulgarians" (''basileus tōn Boulgarōn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title "tsar" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the "Third Rome".

After Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}

===France===
The kings of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).

====First French Empire====
{{See also|First French Empire}}
[[File:NapoleanCoronationDavid.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].&lt;br&gt;The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]
[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la République française'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Français'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Français'').

Napoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.
Napoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.

====Elba====
Since 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau with (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.

On 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as "General Bonaparte", despite the "historical reality that he had been an emperor" and therefore retained the title.&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mémorial de Sainte Hélène'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire à l'enseigne du canon, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second French Empire====
{{See also|Second French Empire}}
Napoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (headed by his choice of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1O6HwzwQs4C&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Race and nation in modern Latin America |first1=Nancy P. |last1=Appelbaum |first2=Anne S. |last2=Macpherson |first3=Karin Alejandra |last3=Rosemblatt |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8078-5441-9 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] followed and after the death of his son Napoleon (IV), in 1879 during the Zulu War, the Bonapartist movement split, and the Third Republic was to last until 1940.

===Iberian Peninsula===
====Spain====
The origin of the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Emperor of All [[Hispania|Spain]]''&lt;ref&gt;Notice that, before the emergence of the modern country of Spain (beginning with the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] in 1492), the Latin word ''[[Hispania]]'', in any of the [[Iberian Romance languages]], either in singular or plural forms (in English: Spain or Spains), was used to refer to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, and not exclusively, as in modern usage, to the country of Spain, thus excluding Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;) is murky. It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866–910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.

King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.

The title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been "emperors", in Spanish or other historiography.

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.

====Portugal====

After the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.

===Great Britain===
{{Main|British Emperor}}
In the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[List of Roman Emperors#Britannic Empire 286 to 297|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.

====England====
There was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102–1167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as "emperor" or "empress", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.

====United Kingdom====
[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]
In 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title "[[Emperor of India]]" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952. 

The last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].

===German Empire===
{{Main|German Empire}}
[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]
Under the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870–71. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.

After his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.

===Russia===
[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]
In 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word "Tsar" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to "King"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers — "Caesar".

On 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin "''Imperator''", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title "''Tsar''". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.

A formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.

The title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.

[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.

===Serbia===
{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}
In 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks" (''цар Срба и Грка'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan and his son Stefan Uroš V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Dušan, [[Simeon Uroš]], and then his son [[Jovan Uroš]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The "Greek" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.

==Emperors in the Americas==

===Pre-Columbian traditions===
The Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.

====Aztec Empire====
The only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375–1521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] slew Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.

====Inca Empire====
The only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438–1533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).

===Post-Columbian Americas===

====Brazil====
[[File:Pedro Américo - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembléia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Américo]]).]]
When [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.

In 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King João VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.

After the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King João's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, João VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' —a purely honorific title—until João VI's death in 1826.

The empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.

====Haiti====
[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].

====Mexico====
[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]

In Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.

Ferdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agustín I]]. Agustín de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].

In 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agustín's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Juárez]].

This empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.

==Persia (Iran)==
{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}

In [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title "[[King of Kings]]" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title "mephet'mephe" has the same meaning.

The last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.

==Indian subcontinent==
{{main|Chakravartin}}
The Sanskrit word for emperor is ''[[Samrāj]]'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.

Typically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja|Maharajah]]'') was only called ''Samrāṭ'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''sārvabhaumā''. The title of ''Samrāṭ'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samrāṭ'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].

[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259–1289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.

After India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''Sultān'', In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. For the period from 1877 to 1947 when British Emperors ruled [[British India]] as the pearl in the crown of the British Empire, see above.

===Ethiopia===

{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}
[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]
From 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|Nəgusä Nägäst}}, literally "King of Kings". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.

Another title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} ("Queen of Kings").

In 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636–653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central African Empire===
{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}
In 1976, President [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I. The expenses of his coronation ceremony actually bankrupted the country. He was overthrown three years later and the republic was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/heads-of-states-and-governments-a-worldwide-encyclopedia-of-over-2300-leaders-1945-through-1992/oclc/30075961|title=Heads of states and governments: a worldwide encyclopedia of over 2,300 leaders, 1945 through 1992|last=Lentz|first=Harris M|date=1994-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0899509266|location=Jefferson, N.C.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asian tradition==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
The rulers of China and (once Westerners became aware of the role) Japan were always accepted in the West as emperors, and referred to as such.  The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.

===China===
{{Main|Emperor of China}}
[[File:Qin Shi Huang BW.png|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]

The [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs 皇 (''huáng'') and 帝 (''dì'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address himself as bìxià (陛下, lit. the "Bottom of the Steps"), corresponding to "[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]"; shèngshàng (聖上, lit. Holy Highness); or wànsuì (萬歲, lit. "You, of Ten Thousand Years").

In 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (始皇帝), which translates as "first emperor". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' ("august one", 皇) and ''di'' ("sage-king", 帝), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title "king" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title 王 ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. 王 is pronounced ''vương'' in Vietnamese, ''ō'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.

The imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', 皇后) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', 皇帝). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690–705 AD).

===Japan===
{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}
[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (裕仁), or the [[Shōwa Emperor]] (昭和天皇), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]
{{cleanup|section|reason=The second paragraph contains many grammar mistakes.|date=June 2014}}

The earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson kōrin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.

In ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either ヤマト大王/大君 (''yamato ōkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), 倭王/倭国王 (''waō''/''wakokuō'', King of Wa, used externally), or 治天下大王 (''amenoshita shiroshimesu ōkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century the word 天皇 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tennō'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]]. The reading 'Tennō' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term 帝 (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.

Japanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to 天皇 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese emperors used Chinese imperial titles,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, rarely was the Chinese-style "[[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]" used. In the Japanese language, the word ''tennō'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''kōtei'' (皇帝) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daijō-tennō|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[shōgun]]'' (formally the imperial generalissimo, but made hereditary) or an [[Sesshō and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead.

After World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.&lt;ref&gt;Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the ([[head of state]]) or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.

As of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a daughter as the first child of the current [[crown prince]], [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito]], Japan [[Crown Prince Naruhito#Marriage and Family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|third child]], the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by [[Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. On 3 January 2007, after the birth of her son, [[Prince Hisahito]], Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070103/ap_on_re_as/japan_imperial_succession&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Keep this section updated in line with the page for Emperor of Japan --&gt;

Currently, many{{who|date=November 2016}} believe the new prince of Japan will ascend the throne, as the law defines. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tennō'', rather than the female consort title ''kōgō'' (皇后) or ''chūgū'' (中宮). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].
&lt;!--
Emperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (天皇 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).
--&gt;
Although current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shintō]] [[religion]]. &lt;!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a "supreme" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--&gt; Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.

===Korea===
[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]

The rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC-668 AD) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ([[Hangul]]: 태왕, [[Hanja]]: 太王), literally translated as the ''Greatest of the Kings''. Also some [[Silla]] (57 BC-935 AD) rulers including [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]] and [[Jinheung of Silla|Jinheung]] used this title for their declaration of independence from the influence of [[Goguryeo]].

The rulers of [[Balhae]] (698–926) internally called themselves ''Seongwang'' ([[Hangul]]: 성왕, [[Hanja]]: 聖王).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:新唐書/卷219|New Book of Tang vol.209]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of emperor and [[Son of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongolian invasions]] (1231–1258), however, Korea relinquished the imperial title.

The rulers of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897) still used the term "King of the Joseon" ([[Hangul]]: 조선국왕, [[Hanja]]: 朝鮮國王). In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–'95, Japan defeated the [[Qing Dynasty]] China, and the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded in which Japan had China recognize the independence and autonomy of Korea. However, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] used term of "His Majesty the Great Monarch" ([[Hangul]]: 대군주폐하, [[Hanja]]: 大君主陛下), not an official imperial title.

In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), and became emperor of Korea. [[Emperor Gojong]] declared the new [[Korean era name|era name]] "Gwangmu" ([[Hangul]]: 광무, [[Hanja]]: 光武, Warrior of light). The Korean Empire maintained their state until 1910 — though it was an Empire by name, it was in fact in the process of being absorbed by Japan.

===Mongolia===
Pre-Mongol Kingdoms such as the Xiongnu used the title "[[Chanyu|Chanu]]" meaning "Ruler of all" in old Mongolian. However it was not until the Chanu name was dropped and instead replaced by "Khan" that the rulers of Mongolia claimed the divine right as the ruler of all under the blue sky, this rule was closely tied with the ancient religious beliefs of the people of Mongolia ([[Tengrism]]). The title [[Khagan]] ([[Khan (title)|khan]] of khans or grand khan) was held by [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206. After 1271, the emperors of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] also took the Chinese title ''huangdi'', or [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.

===Vietnam===
[[File:Bảo Đại au pouvoir.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bảo Đại]], the last Emperor of Vietnam]]
Ngô Quyền, the first ruler of [[Đại Việt]] as an independent state, used the title ''Vương'' (王, ''King''). However, after the death of Ngô Quyền, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[Đinh Bộ Lĩnh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of Đại Việt to use the title ''Hoàng Đế'' (皇帝, ''Emperor'') in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.

Đinh Bộ Lĩnh wasn't the first to claim the title of ''Đế'' (帝, ''Emperor''). Before him, [[Lý Bí]] and [[Mai Thúc Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.

The Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea "Vietnam's equality with China" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S. Reid|title=Việt Nam Borderless Histories|year=2006|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-21770-9|ref=harv|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 the newly established Nguyễn dynasty requested canonization from Chinese [[Jiaqing Emperor]] and received the title ''Quốc Vương'' (國王, ''King of a State)'' and the name of the country as ''An Nam'' (安南) instead ''Đại Việt'' (大越). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Temür Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.

The emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[Bảo Đại]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.

==Oceania==
The lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tuʻi Tonga Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

====UN General Assembly====
On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly Adopted Resolution 217A (III), also known as "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml "History of the Document." U.N.: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 states that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 13(2) states that "Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 13(2)|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence in today's modern world, events such as the [[Trial of Saddam Hussein]] have proven what British jurist  [[A. V. Dicey]]  said in 1885, when he popularized the phrase "rule of law" in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, Albert. (1885). ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey emphasized three aspects of the rule of law :&lt;ref&gt;Palekar, S.A. (2008). ''Comparative Politics and Government.'' (Pp.64-65), New Dehli: PHI Learning, Pvt. Lmt..{{ISBN|978-8120333352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# No one can be punished or made to suffer except for a breach of law proved in an ordinary court.
# No one is above the law and everyone is equal before the law regardless of social, economic, or political status.
# The rule of law includes the results of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons.

====US Declaration of Independence====
The opening of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, states as follows:
{{quote|We hold these truths to be [[self-evident]], that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness]]. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]];&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Global citizenship in the United States" was a term used by former [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 in a speech in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="twsJun16ga"&gt;{{cite news

==Social movements==

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415002147/http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|archivedate=15 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers notes the existence of [[stateless persons]], whom he remarks ought to be the primary candidates for global citizenship, yet continue to live without access to basic freedoms and citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers does not oppose the concept of global citizenship, however he criticizes potential implications of the term depending on one's definition of it, such as ones that provide support for the "ruthlessly capitalist economic system that now dominates the planet."&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers states that global citizenship is a "powerful term"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; because "people that invoke it do so to provoke and justify action,"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; and encourages the attendees of his lecture to re-appropriate it in order for its meaning to have a positive purpose, based on idealistic values.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt;

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Governance without government''' refers to a form of [[governance]] which uses non-governmental means (NGM) of government. It is a paradigm opposing [[Modern Democracy|modern democracy]]. Modern democracy uses democratic procedures and institutions, including legislation and [[communicative rationality]], whereas governance without government uses [[natural law|laws of nature]] instead of legislation, and one-way communication instead of dialogue.

Governance without government is linked to [[managed democracy]], a distorted version of democracy, and [[inverse totalitarianism]], dismantling public institutions and giving the power to institutions where democratic claims are no valid, f.e. big [[corporations]] and [[Secret society|secret societies]].

== Studies in governance without government ==

=== Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri ===

[[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] describe governance without government as the method of governing an [[empire]], by which they mean the current [[world-system]] based on [[Milton Friedman|Friedmanite]] economics and military power. Thus governance without government uses governmental agencies to promote itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, Michael &amp; Negri, Antonio: Emipre.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Georg Simmel ===

[[Georg Simmel]] uses German concept "Form des Beharrens" meaning the idea of governance without government, in connection to monetarist idea of economic exchange in fixed-monetary-base regime.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg: Philosophie des Geldes (The Philosophy of Money)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pierre Bourdieu ===

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] sees independent i.e. Friedmanite [[central bank]]s as the key powerholders, connecting them to Chicago economics, and Chicago economics to one-way communication, economists being not willing to discuss and keen to explain.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre: Contre-Feux (Counterfire: Against the Tyranny of the Market)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann ===

Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann describe year 1989 as the end of the modern era and beginning of the non-democratic regimes around the world attacking against the welfare of the majority of people.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Hans-Peter &amp; Schumann, Harald: Die Globalisierungsfalle: Der Angriff auf Demokratie und Wohlstand (The Global Trap)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naomi Klein ===

Naomi Klein describes year 1989 as the beginning of [[Washington consensus]] and the policy of denying all discussion about alternative economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Naomi: Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Larry Catá Backer ===

Larry Catá Backer describes the organization of economics within multinational enterprise and in global production chains as the basis for governance that in some respects displaces the traditional organization of politics in government within states. &lt;ref&gt;Backer, Larry Catá: "Governance Without Government:  An Overview," in Beyond Territoriality:  Transnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization 87-123 (Günther Handl, Joachim Zekoll, Peer Zumbansen, editors, Leiden, Netherlands &amp; Boston, MA: Martinus Nijhoff, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''governing body''' is a group of people that has the authority to exercise [[governance]] over an [[organization]] or [[political entity]]. The most formal is a [[government]], a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, family, religious denomination, etc.), or another, informal group of people.

In business and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation. A [[board of governors]] is often the governing body of a public institution, while a [[board of directors]] typically serves as the governing body of a corporation or other company larger or more complex than a partnership. Many professional sports have a [[sports governing body]] that serves as their regulating authority.

Governing bodies can vary widely in size, which is "important not only for acquiring the necessary range of skills to oversee the entity, but also in promoting cohesion, flexibility, and effective participation of the members to achieve their governance objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette M. Franzel, ''Designated Federal Entities: Survey of Governance Practices and the Inspector General Role'' (2009), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A governing body is only one compenent of a system of governance, which also requires a written framework under which the body must operate, and governance mechanisms to both carry out directives of the governing body, and to report information back to the governing body.&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Albers, ''The Design of Alliance Governance Systems'' (2005), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of governing bodies include:

=== Education ===
*The [[school governing body]] (SGB) of a school, particularly in Commonwealth areas
*[[Board of education]], the governing body of a school or higher administrative level
*[[University Court]], the governing body of a university in Scotland

=== Religion ===
*The [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses]], the ruling council of Jehovah's Witnesses
*[[Governing Body Commission]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
*Governing Bodies of the [[Conference of European Churches]]

Guerrilla (Spanish for "little war"), as applied to theatrical events, describes the act of spontaneous, surprise performances in unlikely public spaces to an unsuspecting audience. Typically these performances intend to draw attention to a political/social issue through [[satire]], [[protest]], and carnivalesque techniques. Many of these performances were a direct result of the radical [[social movement]]s of the late 1960s through mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster’s College Dictionary. New York: Random House, 1992, pp.593&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla Theater, also referred to as guerrilla performance, has been sometimes related to the [[agitprop theater]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Filewod03"&gt;Filewod, Alan (2003) ''Modernism and Genocide'', in Richard Paul Knowles, William B.

Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;575{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is differentiated from agitprop by the inclusion of [[Dada]] performance tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Origins==
The term ''Guerrilla Theater'' was coined by Peter Berg, who in 1965 suggested it to [[R.G. Davis]] as the title of his essay on the actions of the  [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], an essay that was first published in 1966.&lt;ref name="BraunsteinDoyle02"&gt;Peter Braunstein, Michael William Doyle (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R178zShWUtIC ''Imagine nation: the American counterculture of the 1960s and '70s''], p.93 note #9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1966) ''Guerrilla theater'' in ''[[Tulane Drama Review]]'', summer 1966. Republished in ''[[The SFMT]]'', 149-53. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisRethinking"&gt;Davis (1971) ''Rethinking guerrilla theater, 1971, 1985'' in Donald Lazere [https://books.google.com/books?id=pT8X-YnxOHwC ''American media and mass culture: left perspectives'']  p.599&lt;/ref&gt; The term "guerrilla" was inspired by a passage in a 1961 [[Che Guevara]] essay, which read:&lt;ref name="Gordon07"&gt;Gordon, Kelly Carolyn (2007) ''Guerrilla theater'', in Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1''], pp.568-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernesto Guevara]] ''Guerrilla Warfare'', Thomas M. Davies, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8420-2678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The guerrilla fighter needs full help from the people.... From the very beginning he has the intention of destroying an unjust order and therefore an intention... to replace the old with something new.}}

Davis had studied [[Mime artist|mime]] and modern dance in the 1950s and had discovered [[commedia dell'arte]]. In autumn 1966 around 20 members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe broke off and started their own collective called [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]], who took their name from [[Diggers|a group of 17th century radicals in England]].

== Guerrilla theater in practice ==

Guerrilla theater shares its origins with many forms of political protest and street theatre including [[agitprop]] (agitation-propaganda), [[carnival]], [[parades]], [[Procession|pageants]], [[political protest]], [[performance art]], [[happening]]s, and, most notably, the Dada movement and [[street art|guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;Random House ''Webster's College Dictionary''.  New York: Random House, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this movement is widely studied in Theater History classrooms, the amount of research and documentation of guerrilla theater is surprisingly lacking.  The term, "Guerrilla Theater" seems to have emerged during the mid-1960s primarily as an upshot of activist [[Radical Theater]] groups such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], El [[Teatro Campesino]], and the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Cruz, Jan, ed.  ''Radical Street Performance''.  New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has important roots in [[Allan Kaprow]]'s "happenings".

The first widely documented guerrilla performances were carried out under the leadership of [[Abbie Hoffman]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies).  One of their most publicized events occurred on August 24, 1967, at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] where Hoffman and other Yippies threw dollar bills onto the trading floor below.  Creating a media frenzy, the event was publicized internationally.  In his later publication, ''Soon to be a Major Motion Picture'' (1980), Hoffman refers to his television appearances with specially planned subversive tactics as "guerrilla theater."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar.  ''History of the Theatre''.  7th ed.  Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pg. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla theater was used as a protest demonstration by the anti-war organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. An article from the summer of 1971 published in the glossy magazine ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' detailed one such performance in [[Washington, D.C.]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A squad of soldiers moved through the part adjoining the U.S. Capitol. They were grubby looking troopers, clad in jungle fatigues and "boonie hats" with wide brims turned up. Jumping a low fence, they began shouting at a group of tourists. 'All right. Hold it. Hold it. Nobody move. Nobody move.' Their voices were full of tension and anger. A man broke out of the crowd and started running. Several soldiers fired at once, and the man fell, clutching his stomach. Blood could be seen on the clean sidewalk. The tourists turned away in horror. 'Get a body count,' a soldier yelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Another squad of soldiers emerged from under the Capitol steps. 'All right. ID. ID,' they screeched. 'You got no ID and you [[Viet Cong|VC]].' They quickly grabbed a young woman and led her away, binding her wrists behind her back and prodding her with their rifles.... They grabbed [a] young man and threw him on the ground, tying his hands behind his back. Several of the soldiers kicked him, seeming to aim for his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Then someone took out a long, thick hunting knife and lifted up the man's shirt, holding the knife to his bare stomach, and pushed against it slightly. 'You VC? You VC?' The man said nothing. He was pushed to his feet and shoved down again. Then he was told to get up. This time the knife was pushed to the side of his neck, and the same question was repeated. Still no answer. The man was dragged away.... Then the soldiers left, and a smaller, less angry group of men dressed in khaki fatigues passed out leaflets to the astonished tourists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"''"A US Infantry platoon just passed through here!"'' the pink colored piece of paper read in big bold letters. ''"If you had been Vietnamese... We might have burned your house. We might have shot your dog. We might have shot you... HELP US END THE WAR BEFORE THEY TURN YOUR SON INTO A BUTCHER OR A CORPSE."''&lt;ref&gt;Art Goldberg, "Vietnam Vets: The Anti-War Army," ''Ramparts,'' vol. 10, no. 1 (July 1971), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Post-1970s performance theater==

Another guerrilla performance group that continued the use of the term was the [[Guerrilla Girls]].  This group of feminist artist-activists was established in New York City in 1985 with the purpose of bringing attention to the lack of female artists in major [[art galleries]] and [[museum]]s.  The Guerrilla Girls began their work through guerrilla art tactics which broadened to include guerrilla theater.  Some common practices in their guerrilla theater techniques that have been replicated by other groups include appearing in costume, using assumed names, and disguising their identity.

==Guerrilla theater groups==

The origins and legacy of guerrilla theater can be seen in the work of these political/performance groups:

* [[ACT UP]]
* [[Billionaires for Bush]]
* [[Billionaires for Wealthcare]]
* [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]
* [[The Church of Euthanasia]]
* [[Circus Amok]]
* [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]
* [[El Teatro Campesino]]
* [[Free Southern Theater]]
* [[Reclaim the Streets]]
* [[Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping]]
* [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]
* [[Situationism]]
* [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]
* [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies)
* [[FEMEN]]

'''''Hakham Bashi''''' ({{lang-ota|حاخامباشی}}, {{lang-tr|Hahambaşı}}, {{IPA-tr|hɑˈhɑm bɑˈʃɯ|IPA}}) is the Turkish name for the [[Chief Rabbi]] of the nation's [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]]. In the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] it was also used for the chief rabbi of a particular region of the empire, such as [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] or [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]], though the Hakham Bashi of [[Constantinople]] was considered overall head of the Jews of the Empire.
==Etymology==
''Hakham'' is Hebrew for "wise man" (or "scholar"), while ''başı'' is Turkish for "head".
==History==
[[Image:Alepporabbiwithsecretary.jpg|thumb|Chief Rabbi Jacob Saul Dwek, Hakham Bashi of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], 1907.]]

The institution of the ''Hakham Bashi'' was established by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Mehmet II]], as part of his policy of governing his exceedingly diverse subjects according to their own laws and authorities wherever possible. Religion was considered as primordial aspect of a communities 'national' identity, so the term [[Ethnarch]] has been applied to such religious leaders, especially the ([[Greek Orthodox]]) [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (i.e. in the Sultan's imperial capital, renamed [[Istanbul]] in 1930 but replaced by [[Ankara]] as republican capital in 1923). As [[Islam]] was the official religion of both court and state, the [[Chief Mufti]] in Istanbul had a much higher status, even of cabinet rank.

Because of the size and nature of the Ottoman state, containing a far greater part of the [[diaspora]] than any other, the position of Hakham Bashi has been compared to that of the Jewish [[Exilarch]].

In the Ottoman Empire, and as such, the ''Hakham Bashi'' was the closest thing to an overall [[Exilarch]]al authority among [[Jewry]] everywhere in the Middle East in early modern times. They held broad powers to legislate, judge and enforce the laws among the Jews in the Ottoman Empire and often sat on the [[Sultan]]'s [[divan]].

The office also maintained considerable influence outside the Ottoman Empire, especially after the [[Alhambra decree|forced migration]] of numerous Jewish communities and individuals out of [[Spain]] (after the fall of Granada in 1492) and [[Italy]].

The Chief Rabbi of the modern, secular Republic of [[Turkey]] is still known as ''Hahambaşı''.

The term ''Hakham Bashi'' was also used for the official Government-appointed Chief Rabbi of other important cities in the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]]. In particular, the position of Hakham Bashi of Palestine was the precursor of that of [[List of Sephardi chief rabbis of the Land of Israel|Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

{{Democracy}}
A [[democracy]] is a [[political system]], or a system of decision-making within an institution or organization or a country, in which all members have an equal share of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=democracy, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/49755?redirectedFrom=Democracy#eid|website=OED Online.|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government: the capacity to intervene in their own societies and the recognition of their sovereignty by an international legalistic framework of similarly sovereign states. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.

Democracy is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were themselves considered the founders of Western civilization by the 18th century intellectuals who attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.&lt;ref&gt;Morris I. The Measure Of Civilization : How Social Development Decides The Fate Of Nations [e-book]. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2013. Available from: eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed May 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which these 18th century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be.  Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of empire following the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. 

Modern [[representative democracies]] attempt to bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of authoritarianism through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the [[right to vote]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olson, M. (1993). Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development. American Political Science Review, 87(03), 567-576.&lt;/ref&gt; 
While they engage populations with some level of decision-making, they are defined by the premise of distrust in the ability of human populations to make a direct judgement about candidates or decisions on issues.

==Antiquity==

=== Historic origins ===
Anthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Given that these dynamics are still alive and well today, it is plausible to assume that democracy in one form or another arises naturally in any well-bonded group or [[tribe]].

These types of democracy are commonly identified as [[tribalism]], or ''primitive democracy''. In this sense, a ''primitive democracy'' usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.&lt;ref name="BA1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36707 Political System] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule – including [[monarchy]], [[tyranny]], [[aristocracy]], and [[oligarchy]] – have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.&lt;ref name="BA0"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233828 Democracy] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 B.C. In ancient Greece, where there were many [[Polis|city-states]] with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.

===Proto-democratic societies===
In recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred somewhere else (i.e. other than Greece) first, as [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] developed its complex social and political institutions long after the appearance of the earliest civilizations in [[Egypt]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesopotamia====
[[File:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|right|The tablet containing the epic of [[Gilgamesh]]]]

Studying pre-[[Babylonia]]n Mesopotamia, [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] used [[Sumer]]ian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called ''primitive democracy''. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free male citizens, although "the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose". In early Sumer, kings like [[Gilgamesh]] did not hold the [[autocracy|autocratic]] power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major [[city-state]]s functioned with councils of elders and "young men" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, 1943, pp. 159–172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isakhan, B. (2007). Engaging "Primitive Democracy," Mideast Roots of Collective Governance. ''Middle East Policy'', 14(3), 97–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word "democracy" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted convincingly to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.&lt;ref&gt;Bailkey, 1967, pp. 1211–1236&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the ''Mesopotamian democracy'' from a ''primitive oligarchy''.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
[[File:Anandastupa.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Ananda Stupa, built by the ''[[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]]'' at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], which served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]], one of the world's earliest [[republic]]s ([[Gaṇa sangha]]).&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|year=2002|work=Google Books|publisher=University of California|pages=146–150|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]]'' and ''[[gana]]s'', which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, [[Diodorus]]—a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of India—mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars note the word ''democracy'' at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 1973, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Sainte, 2006, pp. 321–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|right|250px|thumb|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were the sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, there were also a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[Ancient India]]. Among the Mahajanapadas and smaller states, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s followed republican government.]]
Key characteristics of the ''gana'' seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name [[raja]], and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the ''gana'', the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of ''[[Kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]''. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]] had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the [[Shakya]]s, [[Koliya]]s, [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s, and [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s, during the period around [[Gautama Buddha]], had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1997, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Early "republics" or [[Gaṇa sangha]],&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|year=2002|work=Google Books|publisher=University of California|pages=146–150|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]], centered in the city of [[Kusinagara]], and the [[Vajji]] (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Raychaudhuri Hemchandra (1972), ''Political History of Ancient India'', Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Republics in ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=93–|id=GGKEY:HYY6LT5CFT0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions. 

Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an [[oligarchy]] or an [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"&gt;Bongard-Levin, 1996, pp. 61–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma 1968, pp. 109–22&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the ''sangas'', which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens—a surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann T. R., ''Kautilya and the Arthashastra'', Leiden 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the persistence of the [[Varna (Hinduism)|four-tiered Varna class system]].&lt;ref name="Bongard"/&gt; The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste—rigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order—might have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ''ganas'' and ''sanghas'' is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

Hackin [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;pg=PA83 p.83ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

====Sparta====
{{details|Sparta}}
[[File:Lycurgus bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Bas-relief of Lycurgus, one of 23 great lawgivers depicted in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives]]]]

Ancient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent [[city states]] called [[poleis]]. Many of these poleis were oligarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Ostwald 2000, pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Greek [[oligarchy]], and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared,  was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge 2001, p. xii, 276&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy.&lt;ref name="BKDunn1994_p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANPlato"&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 712e-d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANAristotle1294"&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', 1294b&lt;/ref&gt; In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan Kings]] ([[diarchy]]), [[gerousia]] (''Council of Gerontes'' (Elders), including the two kings), the [[ephors]] (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the Kings) and the [[apella]] (assembly of Spartans).

The two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 149–153&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of the state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As [[Aristotle]] noted, ephors were the most important key institution of the state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1981, pp. 498–502&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]]. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the [[helots]] in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the [[gerousia]] and the [[apella]].&lt;ref name="BALycurgus"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049495 Lycurgus] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called [[Great Rhetra]], making it the world's first written constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub 2007, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, pp. 65–85&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as ''όμοιοι'' (''Homoioi'', ''men of equal status''). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, [[agoge]], where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education.&lt;ref name="ANAristotle1294"/&gt;  This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]] to philosophers such as [[Plato]] and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed "every kind of luxury and intemperance" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Spartans were remarkably free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these ''democratic'' elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as [[Plutarch]] writes ''"no man was allowed to live as he wished"'', but as in a ''"military camp"'' all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub 2007, pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;

The political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the [[Persian Wars]]. In addition, Athens, after the [[Persian Wars]], was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the [[Peloponnesian War]], with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when [[Philip II of Macedon]] crushed what remained of the power of the factional city-states to his South.

Athens is often regarded{{Cref2|i}} as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference-point for democracy.

Athens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other [[poleis]], with a dominating powerful aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 159–164&lt;/ref&gt; However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as ''"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables"''.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a [[hoplite]] state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to [[Solon]] to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, 1999, pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BASolon/&gt;

====Solon and the foundations of democracy====
{{details|Solon}}
[[File:Solon.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of [[Solon]] from the National Museum, Naples]]

Solon({{circa}} 638 – {{circa}} 558 BC), an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a [[Lyric poetry| lyric]] poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch ranked him as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] of the ancient world.&lt;ref name=BASolon&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068622 Solon], Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2003, pp. 54–5, 76–98&lt;/ref&gt; Solon divided the Athenians into four property-classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the [[Great Rhetra|Rhetra]] did in Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] (Assembly) and to vote. The Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the [[court]]s.&lt;ref name=BASolon/&gt; All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 400]], which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, those of the [[archons]] (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the [[Areopagus]] (Council of the Hill of Ares), which like the Gerousia in Sparta, was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed [[timocracy|timocratic]] and democratic system of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, pp. 60–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Solon devised the reforms of 594 BC to avert the political, economic, and [[moral decline]] in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solon's reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often{{quantify|date=November 2017}} credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2003, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democracy under Cleisthenes and Pericles====
{{See also|Cleisthenes|Ephialtes|Pericles}}

[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|250px|The [[Pnyx]] with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens]]
Even though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]] became [[tyrant]] of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]] and [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref name="BAPeisitratus"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058970 Peisistratus] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of tyranny (510 BCE) and before the year 508–507 was over, [[Cleisthenes]] proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].&lt;ref name="BACleisthenes"/&gt; Cleisthenes reorganized the population of citizens into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones,&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1996, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt; and improve the army's organization.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all male citizens, [[isonomia]],&lt;ref name="BACleisthenes"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024296 Cleisthenes Of Athens] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; by expanding access to power to more citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaud, 2007 pp. 144–9&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Athenians first used the word "democracy" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: δημοκρατία – "rule by the people") to define their new system of government.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, 2001, pp. 194–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the next generation, Athens entered its [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]], becoming a great center of [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]] and [[Ancient Greek art|art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Greek victories in [[Persian Wars]] (499–449 BCE) encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military campaigns) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, [[Ephialtes of Athens|Ephialtes]] and [[Pericles]] presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed [[thetes]] (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office.&lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub, 2008, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians' greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a [[political machine]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} In the following passage, [[Thucydides]] recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule:

{{cquote|Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a ''democracy''. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides ''History of the Peloponnesian War'', [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2|2.37.2–3]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Pericles with the Corinthian helmet|bust of Pericles]] bearing the inscription "[[Pericles]], son of [[Xanthippus]], Athenian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original from ca. 430 BCE.]]
The Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom of citizens(through the reforms of Solon) and on equality of citizens(isonomia) - introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used [[sortition|lot]] for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were ''"equally"'' qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Hansen, J. A. Crook, ''The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8061-3143-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AgNdHQAACAAJ Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position.&lt;ref&gt;L. Carson, B. Martin, ''Random Selection in Politics'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96702-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIieJo1Yo1EC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts formed another important political institution in Athens; they were composed of a large number of [[jury|juries]] with no [[judge]]s, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders.&lt;ref name="BA0"/&gt; Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory,&lt;ref&gt;The exception was the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 500]], where the poor could refuse to serve.&lt;/ref&gt; and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being "drafted" to office.  The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the ''strategoi'' (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the ''treasurers'', who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by [[majority]] vote in the Ecclesia (compare [[direct democracy]]), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule of 500]], which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year&lt;ref name="BABoule"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/75519/boule Boule (Ancient Greek Council)] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; and no citizen could serve more than twice.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, 2001, pp. 300–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Athenian democracy was not only ''direct'' in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also ''directest'' in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.&lt;ref&gt;Raafaub, 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense,{{Cref2|ii}} the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;
&lt;!-- We might need to add a small paragraph to describe the Athenian democracy under Demosthenes --&gt;

====The birth of political philosophy====
{{See also|Socrates|Plato|Aristotle}}

Within the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the [[Greek colonies|Greek world]] gathered to develop their theories. [[Socrates]] (470-399 BCE) was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil [[Plato]] (died 348/347), about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of [[political philosophy]]. The political philosophy developed in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, ''"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Hall| first= Peter| title= Cities in Civilisation| publisher= Orion| place= London| year= 1999| isbn= 9780753808153| page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny, or today: autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)| ''Politics'']]:

{{cquote|Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty—that is what is usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty, for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty.&lt;ref name="AristotlePol1317b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0058:book=6:section=1317b|title=Aristotle, Politics, Book 6, section 1317b|author=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Decline, revival, and criticisms====
The Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution (both times during the crisis at the end of the [[Pelopponesian War]] of 431 to 404 BC), establishing first the [[The Four Hundred (oligarchy)|Four Hundred]] (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet régime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (in 404 BCE). Both votes took place [[Demagogy|under manipulation and pressure]], but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as "nomothetai". Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King [[Phillip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359-336 BCE) and later [[Alexander the Great]] (reigned 336–323 BCE) unified Greece, but it was politically over-shadowed by the [[Hellenistic era|Hellenistic empires]]. Finally, after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration.

However, democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers, but due to its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works, after the rediscovery of [[classics]] during the [[Renaissance]], Sparta's political stability was praised,&lt;ref name="PlatoRepublic"&gt;Plato, ''Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartledge"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes held power.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Only centuries afterwards, after the publication of ''A History of Greece'' by [[George Grote]] from 1846 onwards, did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, (1992), pp. 14–30&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century scholars re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a "post-modern" example for communities and organizations alike.&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 1996, pp. 15–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
{{See also|Roman Republic}}

Even though Rome is classified as a Republic and not a democracy, its history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 2005, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 2002, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 2005, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Roman Republic====

{{see also|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic|Elections in the Roman Republic}}
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Representation of a sitting of the Roman Senate: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catilina]], from a 19th-century fresco.]]

Rome was a city-state in [[Italy]] next to powerful neighbors; [[Etruscans]] had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]].&lt;ref name="Livy, 2002, p. 23"&gt;Livy, 2002, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant, 1942, p. 23"&gt;Durant, 1942, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families ([[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) and the rest of the population, the [[plebeians]] continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers.&lt;ref name="Livy, 2002, p. 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant, 1942, p. 23"/&gt; When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men – a ''decemviri'' – to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into [[Twelve Tables]] and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state.

The political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution&lt;ref&gt;This view was already ancient when Polybius brought it to bear on Rome (Walbank 2002: 281).&lt;/ref&gt; and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the [[Roman assemblies|assemblies]].&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consultum'' and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice, it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also, it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 [[denarius|denarii]] worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members.&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice, the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate&lt;ref name="Balot, 2009, p. 216"/&gt; and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as [[Livy]] writes ''"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men"''.&lt;ref name="Liv1.43.11"&gt;Liv 1.43.11&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes.&lt;ref name=Liv1.43.11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dion. Ant. Rom. 4.20.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman stability, in [[Polybius]]’ assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the [[Punic Wars|Hannibalic War]] was an effect of the latter's greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Polyb. 6.51&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense – ''eleutheria'': living as you like – have fallen on stony ground, since ''eleutheria'' (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;) was anathema in the Roman eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Balot, 2009, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's core values included order, hierarchy, discipline, and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes, since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples.

Rome became the ruler of a great [[Mediterranean]] empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy, and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of the constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of over-mighty generals, championing the cause of either the rich or the poor, in the last century BCE.

====Transition to empire====

{{See also|History of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:0005MAN-OctAugusto.jpg|thumb|A fragment of a bronze [[equestrian order]] statue of [[Augustus]], [[Roman Emperor]], 1st century AD.]]

Over the next few hundred years, various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons, mostly to address perceived injustices, either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was [[Julius Caesar]], where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesar's career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]. In the power vacuum that followed Caesar's assassination, his friend and chief lieutenant, [[Marcus Antonius]], and Caesar's grandnephew [[Octavian]] who also was the adopted son of Caesar, rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However, in 31 BC war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE, at the naval [[Battle of Actium]] where the fleet of Octavian under the command of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] routed Antony's fleet. Thereafter, there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to, or could stand against Octavian, and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact, though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions, having the military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition, though subtle, disguised, and relying on personal power over the power of offices, was complete. In that year, Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate, and in a carefully staged way, the Senate refused and titled Octavian ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' — "the revered one". He was always careful to avoid the title of ''rex'' — "king", and instead took on the titles of ''princeps'' — "first citizen" and ''[[imperator]]'', a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders.

====The Roman Empire and late antiquities====

The [[Roman Empire]] had been born. Once Octavian named [[Tiberius]] as his heir, it was clear to everyone that even the hope of a restored Republic was dead. Most likely, by the time Augustus died, no one was old enough to know a time before an Emperor ruled Rome. The Roman Republic had been changed into a [[Despotism|despotic]] régime, which, underneath a competent and strong Emperor, could achieve military supremacy, economic prosperity, and a genuine peace, but under a weak or incompetent one saw its glory tarnished by cruelty, military defeats, revolts, and civil war.

The Roman Empire was eventually divided between the [[Western Roman Empire]] which fell in 476 AD and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (also called the Byzantine Empire) which lasted until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 AD.

* The [[Germanic tribe|Germanic tribal]] [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] assemblies described by [[Tacitus]] in his [[Germania]].
* The [[Christian Church]] well into the 6th century AD had its bishops elected by popular acclaim.
* The [[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]] of the Roman period: associations of various social, economic, religious, funerary and even sportive natures elected officers yearly, often directly modeled on the [[Senate of Rome]].

== Institutions in the medieval era ==
{{further|Medieval commune}}
[[File:Olav den helliges saga CK5.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]] is teaching the Swedish king [[Olof Skötkonung]] that the power resides with the people, 1018, [[Uppsala]], by C. Krogh.]]

Most of the procedures used by modern democracies are very old. Almost all cultures have at some time had their new leaders approved, or at least accepted, by the people; and have changed the laws only after consultation with the assembly of the people or their leaders. Such institutions existed since before the times of the ''[[Iliad]]'' or of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and modern democracies are often derived from or inspired by them, or what remained of them.

Nevertheless, the direct result of these institutions was not always a democracy. It was often a narrow [[oligarchy]], as in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], or even an absolute monarchy, as in [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Florence]], in the Renaissance period; but during the medieval period [[Guild|guild democracies]] did evolve.

Early institutions included:

* The continuations of the early Germanic [[thing (assembly)|thing]]:
** The [[Witenagemot]] (folkmoot) of [[Anglo-Saxon England|Early Medieval England]], councils of advisors to the kings of the [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms|petty kingdoms]] and then that of a unified England before the [[Norman Conquest]].
** The [[Franks|Frankish]] custom of the [[Märzfeld]] or ''Camp of Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]], chapters XLIX, LII; pp. 1685,1857 Heritage Club edition (1946). For a recent view, see [[David Nicolle]]; ''Carolingian cavalryman, AD 768–987,'' p. 45 ff. Intermediate sources tend to be colored by the "Free institutions of our Germanic ancestors" [[meme]].&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in Portuguese, Leonese, Castillian, Aragonese, Catalan and Valencian customs, [[Cortes Generales|cortes]] were periodically convened to debate the state of the Realms.
** [[Tynwald]], on the [[Isle of Man]], claims to be one of the oldest continuous [[parliament]]s in the world, with roots back to the late 9th or 10th century.
** The [[Althing]], the parliament of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], founded in 930. It consisted of the 39, later 55, ''goðar''; each owner of a ''goðarð''; and each hereditary ''goði'' kept a tight hold on his membership, which could in principle be lent or sold. Thus, for example, when [[Njál's saga|Burnt Njal]]'s stepson wanted to enter it, Njal had to persuade the Althing to enlarge itself so a seat would become available. But as each independent farmer in the country could choose what goði represented him, the system could be claimed as an early form of democracy. The Alþing has run nearly continuously to the present day. The Althing was preceded by less elaborate "[[Thing (assembly)|things]]" (assemblies) all over Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Burnt [[Njal's Saga]]'', tr. Magnus Magnusson, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ''[[Thing of all Swedes]]'', which took place annually at [[Uppsala]] at the end of February or in early March. As in Iceland, the [[lawspeaker]] presided over the assemblies, but the Swedish king functioned as a judge. A famous incident took place circa 1018, when King [[Olof Skötkonung]] wanted to pursue the war against Norway against the will of the people. [[Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker]] reminded the king in a long speech that the power resided with the Swedish people and not with the king. When the king heard the din of swords beating the shields in support of Þorgnýr's speech, he gave in. [[Adam of Bremen]] wrote that the people used to obey the king only when they thought his suggestions seemed better, although in war his power was absolute.

* The ''[[túath]]a'' system in [[History of Ireland#Early medieval era (circa 800 to 1100)|early medieval Ireland]]. Landowners and the masters of a profession or craft were members of a local assembly, known as a ''túath''. Each ''túath'' met in annual assembly which approved all common policies, declared war or peace on other ''tuatha'', and accepted the election of a new "king"; normally during the old king's lifetime, as a [[tanist]]. The new king had to be descended within four generations from a previous king, so this usually became, in practice, a hereditary kingship; although some kingships alternated between lines of cousins. About 80 to 100 ''túatha'' coexisted at any time throughout Ireland. Each ''túath'' controlled a more or less compact area of land which it could pretty much defend from cattle-raids, and this was divided among its members.

During late medieval and renaissance periods, Venice became an oligarchy and others became "Signorie".

==Indigenous peoples of the Americas==
{{see also|Great Law of Peace#Influence on the United States Constitution}}
Historian [[Jack Weatherford]] has argued that the ideas leading to the [[United States Constitution]] and democracy derived from various [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] including the [[Iroquois]].  Weatherford claimed this democracy was founded between the years 1000–1450, and lasted several hundred years, and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America.&lt;ref name="isbn0-449-90496-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherford, J. McIver |author-link=J. McIver Weatherford |title=Indian givers: how the Indians of the Americas transformed the world |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-449-90496-2 |oclc= |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Temple University]] professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois Elizabeth Tooker has reviewed these claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact.  The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature.  The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a speech by the Iroquois chief [[Canasatego]] in 1744.  Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.&lt;ref name="Tooker E 1990 https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: cultural fictions and government policies |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128] | chapter = The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1 |oclc= | author=Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary.  The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan.  Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe.  Tooker concludes that "...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois" and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|J.N.B. Hewitt]] which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937.&lt;ref name="Tooker E 1990 https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128"/&gt;

The [[Aztecs]] also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.&lt;ref name="isbn0-449-90496-2"/&gt;

The [[Levellers]] published a newspaper (The Moderate) and pioneered political [[petition]]s, [[pamphleteer]]ing and party colours.

===The secret ballot===
{{Main|Secret ballot}}
[[File:Cardiganshire Election ballot paper 1880.jpg|thumb|A British secret ballot paper, 1880]]
The notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.

The stone inscriptions in a temple say that ballot elections were held in South India by a method called Kudavolai system. Kudavolai means the ballot sheet of leaf that was put secretly in a pot vessel called "kudam". The details are found inscribed on the walls of the village assembly hall. Actually, the once village-assembly hall is the present temple. The details show that the village had a secret ballot electoral system and a written Constitution, prescribing the mode of elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Waves of democracy in the 20th century===
[[File:Waves of democracy.png|450px|thumb|right|The three 20th century waves of democracy, based on the number of nations 1800–2003 scoring 8 or higher on [[Polity IV]] scale, another widely used measure of democracy.]]
{{See also|Wave of democracy}}

The end of the [[First World War]] was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, [[universal suffrage]] for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in [[Finland]] as well as a [[proportional representation]], [[open list]] system. Likewise, the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under [[Alexander Kerensky]] until [[Lenin]] took over in October. The terrible economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.

In 1918 the United Kingdom granted the right to vote to women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On August 18, 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945. 

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called "Indians" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if "subject to the jurisdiction thereof"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924.  The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.

===Post-World War II===
[[World War II]] was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet [[satellite state]]s. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] dictatorships (most notably in Spain and [[Portugal]]) continued to exist.
* MaxRange data has defined and categorised the level of democracy and political regime type to all states and months from 1789 to this day and updating. MaxRange shows a dramatic expansion of democracy, especially from 1989. The third wave of democracy has been successful and covered major parts of previous autocratic areas. MaxRange can show detailed correlations between success of democracy and many relevant variables, such as previous democratic history, the transitional phase and selection of institutional political system. Even though the number of democratic states has continued to grow since 2006, the share of weaker electoral democracies has grown significantly. This is the strongest causal factor behind fragile democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html|title=MaxRange|author=|date=|website=www.hh.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had moved towards democracy during the [[Taishō period]] during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar [[Occupied Japan|Allied occupation]], with initial elections in 1946.

===Decolonisation and civil rights movements===
World War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.

The aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel 1997, p. 257. "A current list of liberal democracies includes: Andorra, Argentina, ..., Cyprus, ..., Israel, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Global Survey 2006: Middle East Progress Amid Global Gains in Freedom". Freedom House (2005-12-19). Retrieved on 2007-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]] became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, [[India]] achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with [[universal suffrage]] which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the [[British Empire]] often adopted the [[Westminster parliamentary system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[decolonisation]] created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.

In the United States of America, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] enforced the 15th Amendment. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] ended [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxing]] by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]] in 1971.

===Late Cold War and after===
New waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the [[communist state]]s in the [[USSR]] sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.

Much of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.

[[File:Electoral democracies.png|thumb|350px|Countries highlighted in &lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; are designated "[[representative democracy|electoral democracies]]" in Freedom House's 2017 survey "Freedom in the World", covering the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf|title=Freedom in The World report, 2017 |author=|date=|website=freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

An analysis by the U.S. Government funded [[Freedom House]] shows that there was not a single liberal democracy with [[universal suffrage]] in the world in 1900, but that in 2000, 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% were such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations with "restricted democratic practices" in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the present. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House. 1999. [http://www.freedomhouse.org/reports/century.html "Democracy’s Century: A Survey of Global Political Change in the 20th Century."]&lt;/ref&gt; While the specifics may be open to debate (for example, [[New Zealand]] actually enacted [[universal suffrage]] in 1893, but is discounted due to a lack of complete sovereignty and certain restrictions on the [[Māori people|Māori]] vote), the numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century.

===Democracy in the 21st century===
In the 21st century, democracy movements have been seen across the world.
In the [[Arab world]], an unprecedented series of [[Arab Spring|major protests]] occurred with citizens of [[Egypt]], Tunisia, [[Bahrain]], Yemen, [[Jordan]], Syria and other countries across the [[MENA region]] demanding democratic rights. This [[revolutionary wave]] was given the term [[Tunisia Effect]], as well as the Arab Spring. The [[Palestinian Authority]] also took action to address democratic rights.

In Africa, continent of 55 countries, a process of democratization began in 1990 at the end of the Cold War in the transition from single parties to multiparty. However, undemocratic regimes began to organize elections: as a result, the diversions of electoral processes upstream essentially, the day of the vote sometimes, or the compilation of the minutes, in some cases of inversion of final result, have become very common. Out of 55 countries, the process of continental democratization seems almost stalled since 2005 because of the resistance of some 20 non-democratic regimes, most of which originated in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regardexcentrique.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/2016-annee-des-coups-detat-electoraux-en-afrique-et-democratisation-de-lafrique-depuis-1990|title=2016, année des coups d’Etat électoraux en Afrique et démocratisation de l’Afrique depuis 1990- 27 avril 2017|author=Régis Marzin|date=|website=regardexcentrique.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], following a highly disputed presidential vote fraught with corruption, Iranian citizens held a major series of protests calling for change and democratic rights (see: the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]] and the [[2011 Iranian protests]]). The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]] led to a toppling of [[Saddam Hussein]] and a new constitution with free and open elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deeks|first1=Ashley|last2=Burton|first2=Matthew|title=Iraq's Constitution: A Drafting History|journal=Cornell International Law Journal|date=2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1-88|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/cintl40&amp;i=7|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}{{POV statement|date=June 2014}}

In Asia, the country of [[Burma]] (also known as Myanmar) had long been ruled by a [[military junta]]; however, in 2011, the government changed to allow certain voting rights and released democracy-leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from house arrest. However, Burma still will not allow Suu Kyi to run for election and still has major human rights problems and not full democratic rights. However, this was later partially abrogated with the election of Suu Kyi's national league for democracy party and her appointment as the de facto leader of Burma (Myanmar) with the title "state councellor", as she is still not allowed to be president and therefore leads through a figurehead, Htin Kyaw. Human rights, however, have not improved. In [[Bhutan]], in December 2005, the 4th King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] announced that the first general elections would be held in 2008, and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently undergoing further changes to allow for a [[constitutional monarchy]]. In the [[Maldives]], protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|presidential elections]] in 2008. These were however undone by a coup in 2018.

Not all movement has been pro-democratic however. In Poland and Hungary, so-called 'illiberal democracies' have taken hold, with the ruling parties in both countries considered by the EU and civil society to be working to undermine democratic governance. Also in Europe, the Spanish government refused to allow a democratic vote on the future of Catalunya, a decision causing months of instability in the region. Meanwhile, in Thailand a military junta twice overthrew democratically elected governments and has changed the constitution in order to increase its own power. The authoritarian regime of Han Sen in Cambodia also dissolved the main opposition party and effectively implemented a one-man dictatorship. There are also large parts of the world such as China, Russia, Central and South East Asia, the Middle East and much of Africa which have consolidated authoritarian rule rather seeing it weaken.

==Contemporary trends==
{{further|E-democracy}}

Under the influence of the theory of [[deliberative democracy]], there have been several experiments since the start of the new millennium with what are called [[deliberative fora]], places (in [[real life]] or in [[cyber space]]) where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange [[reason]]s.  One type of deliberative forum is called a [[minpublic]]: a body of randomly chosen or actively selected citizens that represents the whole population.  The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is known as [[sortition]].  Examples of this are [[citizens' assemblies]] and [[citizens' juries]].  Citizens' assemblies have been used in Canada (2004, 2006) and the Netherlands (2006) to debate electoral reform, and in Iceland (2009 and 2010) for broader constitutional change.

{{Cnote2|i| Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] of Plato and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] of Aristotle, continuing with [[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]] of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. The latest, listed in the References section, include works from scholars such as [[John Dunn (political scientist)|J. Dunn]], [[Josiah Ober|J. Ober]], T. Buckley, J. Thorley and E. W.

Despite its flaws (slavery, no women's rights) it is often considered the closest to the ideal democracy and called as ''classical'' democracy. It is often compared with modern (representative) democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 1994, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, 1994, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|ii| The ancient Greeks did not have a word to use for "rights".&lt;ref&gt;Ober, 1996, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Cnote2|iii| The United States of America was and is, a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy can be defined as a form of government in which the people decide matters directly, with prime example the Athenian democracy. A democratic republic, is a form of government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. The delegates who wrote the Constitution were fearful of direct democracy; in the words of James Madison: ''"[D]emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm|title=The Federalist #10|author=|date=|website=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the framers recognized that the public is required to impose a check to the government, in Madison words: ''"dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm|title=The Federalist #51|author=|date=|website=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By popular usage, however, the word "democracy" came to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States can be called a democratic republic. Many states allow for policy questions to be decided directly by the people by voting on ballot initiatives or referendums. (Initiatives originate with, or are initiated by, the people while referendums originate with, or are referred to the people by a state's legislative body.)}}

[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Thirteen [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonies on the east coast of [[North America]] issued a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776]]
[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| [[Chile]], one of several [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonies in [[South America]], issued a [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Declaration of independence]] in 1818]]

'''Independence''' is a condition of a [[nation]], [[country]], or [[Sovereign state|state]] in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise [[self-government]], and usually [[sovereignty]], over the territory. The opposite of independence is the status of a [[dependent territory]].

==Definition of independence==
Whether the attainment of independence is different from [[revolution]] has long been contested, and has often been debated over the question of [[violence]] as  [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] means to achieving sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benjamin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Benjamin |title=Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 1: 1913–1926 |origyear=1921 |year=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=236–252 |nopp=true |isbn=0-674-94585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power  with or without an element of emancipation, such as in [[democratization]] ''within'' a state, which as such may remain unaltered. The [[Haitian Revolution]], for example, began as a colony-wide slave uprising that was originally content with the pro-abolitionist [[French First Republic|French Republic]], only to turn into a war into of independence when [[Napoleon]] tried to re-install slavery. In contrast, the [[American Revolutionary War]] was intended to achieve independence from the beginning. Causes for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many, but most can be summed up as a feeling of inequality compared to the dominant power. The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations, like in the case of [[Indian independence movement|India]](1947), to a [[Wars of national liberation|violent war]] like in the case of [[Algerian War|Algeria]](1954).

===Distinction between independence and autonomy===
''[[Autonomous entity|Autonomy]]'' refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing [[authority]] that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory (see [[Devolution]]). A [[protectorate]] refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region.

==Declarations of independence==
Sometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a [[declaration of independence]]; the earliest surviving example is [[Scotland]]'s [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320, with the most recent example being [[Azawad]]'s declaration of independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] issued in 1776. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national [[Public holiday|holiday]] known as an [[independence Day|independence day]].

==Historical overview==
Historically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence:
* from the 1770s, beginning with the [[American Revolutionary War]] through the 1830s, when the last royalist bastions fell at the close of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]];
* the immediate aftermath of the [[First World War]] following the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[German Empire|German]] empires; 
* and 1945 to circa 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the European [[colonial empire]]s and collapsed [[III Reich|nazi German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], ''[http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full The Declaration of Independence in World Context]'', [[Organization of American Historians]],  ''Magazine of History'', Volume 18, Issue 3, Pp. 61–66 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5274">'''Influence peddling''' is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in [[Money trail|return for payment]]. Also called '''traffic of influence''' or '''trading in influence'''. In fact, influence peddling is not necessarily illegal as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has often used the term "undue influence peddling" to refer to illegal acts of lobbying. [http://www.oecd.org/document/32/0,3343,en_2649_37443_42694048_1_1_1_1,00.html] However, influence peddling bears the stench of corruption that may de-legitimise democratic politics with the general public.

==Known cases==
{{see also|Boudougate}}
*In 2012 the vice president of Argentina [[Amado Boudou]] was accused of being a mere straw owner of the printing house Ciccone Calcográfica, a private company that has contracts to print over 120 million new Argentine pesos banknotes, license plates, and other government issues. The contracts were awarded by Boudou himself when he was the Economy Minister of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-caso-de-la-ex-imprenta-ciccone-t47923 El caso de la ex imprenta Ciccone (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first of four politicians convicted in relation to the Scandal and the remaining politicians are on or awaiting trial.
*As of December 2008, the [[Governor of Illinois]], [[Rod Blagojevich]] was accused of influence peddling in attempting to sell the [[US Senate|Senate]] seat vacated by [[President-elect]] [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/31/illinois.senate/index.html?eref=rss_topstories |title=Senate Democrats hope stalling can block Blagojevich's pick |last=Hornick |first=Ed |author2=Kristi Keck |author3=Brianna Keilar |date=December 31, 2008 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2008-12-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ydw3SCId?url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-12-31/politics/illinois.senate_1_state-jesse-white-roland-burris-governor-blagojevich?_s=PM%3APOLITICS |archivedate=May 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Additionally, the [[mayor]] of [[Ottawa]], [[Larry O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Larry O'Brien]], began his trial on similar grounds in May 2009. O'Brien was accused of purported influence peddling.

This is an overview of '''Women's Suffrage activism and local politics''' as experienced in [[Leigh, Lancashire]] between 1900 and 1914.   

== 1900 to 1909 ==

In October 1900 Mrs A Urmston of the Leigh Co-operative Women's Guild,&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Cooperative Women's Guild Monthly Reports. Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to Leigh's MP, [[C. P. Scott]] asking him to vote favourably on Women's Suffrage Bills. He answered in the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Archive, Women's Suffrage collection GDN/123/54 and 55 Archive + Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 [[Henry Yorke Stanger]], Leigh County Court Judge and MP for [[Kensington North]], introduced a private member's Women's Suffrage Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard February 1908 on line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 2 September 1910&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 15 July 1909, [[Women's Social and Political Union]] activists, [[Annie Kenney]], [[Jennie Baines]], [[Mabel Capper]], [[Charlotte Marsh]] and [[Florence Clarkson]] attempted to force their way into Leigh Co-operative Hall to disrupt the Liberal Party's guest speaker, [[Lewis Harcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909&lt;/ref&gt; After a violent struggle, Clarkson of Oxford Road, Manchester was arrested and bailed at £10.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day when tried in Leigh Police Station's Day Room,&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; she refused to pay the 20 [[shilling]] fine imposed and was sentenced to fourteen days in the second division at [[Strangeways]] Gaol in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Court Register Volume 3 16 July 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  There she went on [[hunger strike]] but did not serve her full sentence without food, denying herself food for 65 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 6 August 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

==  National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies ==

During the General Election of January 1910, members of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) visited Leigh to collect signatures for their Voters’ Petition.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 28 January 1910 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  They aimed to prove that male voters were in favour of votes for women.  With the cooperation of local suffragists, 2,843 signatures were collected at Leigh polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Archive + M50 Women's Suffrage Collection Reel 3&lt;/ref&gt;  After which, a banner stating "2,843 Men of Leigh Demand Women’s Suffrage" was used to advertise suffrage meetings in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, Women's Suffrage Movement:A Reference Guide&lt;/ref&gt; A similar banner, bearing the same legend was used in the "Prison to Citizenship Constitutional Demonstration" in London on 18 June 1910.&lt;ref&gt;British Pathe News: Various Suffrage Material Religion, Politics, Trade and Industry stills 137,138,139&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1910 the [[North of England Society for Women's Suffrage]] began a consciousness raising campaign in Leigh.&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1910 the Leigh branch of the NUWSS, the Leigh Women’s Suffrage Society, was formed. Its first secretary was Miss F.P. Hindshaw BA,&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives +&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Miss L. Cook of 13 Railway Road.&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives &lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the Leigh branch was not gendered and non party. The campaign took the form of a series of public meetings and debates led by prominent pro-suffrage workers, supported by local interested parties and out of town speakers, including the Liberal Association President, and editor and proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, C.P. Scott. Other key speakers included Mrs F.T. Swanwick, suffragist and editor of the NUWSS paper the [[Common Cause]]: [[Kathleen Courtney]], secretary of the North of England Society for Women’s Suffrage; Lisbeth Simms of the Women’s Labour League;  Margaret Robertson BA Manchester Society/NUWSS organiser: and a Manchester councillor, [[Margaret Ashton]], founder member of the Women’s Trade Union League and chairperson of the NUWSS. The women spoke on why women needed and deserved the vote whilst attempting to discredit opponents' arguments. They stressed their non militancy, non party and law abiding credentials to address a degree of fear by women of becoming identified with the "shrieking sisterhood" (WSPU). Locally there were immediate and legitimate reasons for unease and fear.  When Margaret Robertson spoke at a [[National Union of Teachers]] Association meeting in Leigh, some male members in the audience "moodily twirled their moustaches and gazed at the floor" and the chairman "kept a few from that energy of opposition that often ends in blows".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 6 November 1911 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This latent aggression on occasion resulted in violence, and in one instance was condoned by the local press.  When a socialist in Tyldesley was mobbed for hanging out a ‘Votes for Women’ banner, Leigh Chronicle opined "he asked for it" and "deserved what he got".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 1913 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political associations==

A proportion of the town's women had organised into political associations before the campaign.  The Leigh Women’s Liberal Association was particularly large. Three hundred women were taken by train from [[Westleigh, Greater Manchester|Westleigh]] to [[Lowton]], to be thanked for their part in MP [[Peter Raffan]]'s 1910 Parliamentary election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 12 August 1910 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town hall&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1914 the women held tea meetings where between 100 and 200 attendees were addressed by speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 15 November 1911 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Female Conservatives organised in either Women’s Unionist or Conservative Associations. These were large organisations, with sufficient kudos to attract the Rt Hon [[Austen  Chamberlain]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 24 November 1911 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the Labour Party was in its infancy, it was formed in July 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence from Leigh Trades Council to the Labour Representation Committee and George Brown, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; it had an  active women's section.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal July 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women’s Labour League==

The [[Women's Labour League]] was a Labour Party pressure group, formed in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Collette, ''For Labour and for Women: The Women's Labour League 1906-1918''&lt;/ref&gt; It promoted and supported  both male and female candidates for parliamentary or municipal office and [[Boards of Guardians]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Collette, For Labour and for Women: The Women's Labour League.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911  WLL branches were established at [[Bamfurlong, Greater Manchester|Bamfurlong]], [[Ashton in Makerfield]], [[Golborne]], [[Lowton]], Leigh and [[Tyldesley]].&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports WLL/1/163 to 165, Labour Party Archives, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;  The Leigh Labour Party was ambitious. Tom Greenall was its first Parliamentary candidate for the General Election of January 1910 and it was increasing its membership of Leigh Council.

==Mrs G Mottram==

The Lowton and Leigh WLL branches had a committed and able leader, Mrs G Mottram, who was a founder and secretary for the Lowton and Leigh branches.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports, WLL/1.163 to 165 Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; The  branches were small, 20 in Lowton and 60 in Leigh,&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League WLL Labour Party Archive, People's Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; 
but they made an impact during Leigh’s municipal elections. Mrs Mottram stood, unsuccessfully, as a candidate for Leigh Rural District Council and the Leigh Guardians' elections in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League The League Leaflet February 1913, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum Mancheste&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended WLL Conferences – at [[Earlestown]] she argued for equal pay for women and she was a member of the Leigh Insurance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Leaflet February 1913, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; During WW1 she agitated for Municipal Lodging Houses for women munitions workers, was a member of the Leigh War 
Emergency Workers Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Minute Book, General Purposes Committee, 16 May 1916, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of Leigh’s Naval and Military War Pensions Committee and helped devise systems to aid Leigh’s Disabled Soldiers and Sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Records, The League Leaflet February 1913 Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilitating working class membership==

Like [[Ellen Wilkinson]], who became a Labour MP, cabinet minister, and leader of the [[Jarrow March]]ers, working in Tyldesley,&lt;ref&gt;Red Ellen Wilkinson, Matt Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs Mottram was both a WLL and NUWSS organiser.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports, Labour Party Archive,&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1910 the NUWSS launched its Friends of Women's Suffrage Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Stanley Holton, Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics 1900-1918&lt;/ref&gt;. It enabled people who could not afford membership fees to become members simply by pledging their allegiance which widened the demographic and increased the membership. From a membership of 21,571 in 1910, by 1913 39,000 "friends" had enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Stanley Holton, Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics in Britain 1900-1918&lt;/ref&gt; From 200 branches in 1910 there were 602 in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, NUWSS on line&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time NUWSS leaders, particularly in the North, increasingly identified with the working clases and for an industrial town like Leigh this was particularly pertinent.

==Leigh municipal elections 1912== 

Mrs Mottram’s feminism and Labour politics came together during Leigh’s 1912 and 1913 municipal elections.  Mr J L Prescott, the successful Labour candidate for St Mary’s Ward in 1912, acknowledged that the work of Mrs Mottram and the Women’s Labour League co-workers had been a big factor in his success against the Liberal J. Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 8 November 1912 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Mrs Mottram’s co-workers were drawn from the women’s sections of all Leigh’s political parties.  

In 1912 Mrs Nessie Egerton Stewart Brown, President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women’s Liberal Association warned that its members were losing patience with the Lancashire and Cheshire Liberal Association’s refusal to discuss the question of Women’s Suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Guardian Cuttings Book, Letter from Mrs Egerton Stewart Brown May 1912, John Rylands Library Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time Leigh’s Liberal women were offered an alternative.  The NUWSS, which contained a large Liberal contingent, disappointed by the Liberal Party’s continual rejection of women’s suffrage reached an agreement with the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 24 May 1912 Wigan Arches Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party was the only party to pledge its complete support for Women’s Suffrage, the NUWSS agreed to support Labour Parliamentary and municipal candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 25 May 1912, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservative Party in the main, were anti-women’s suffrage.  In the 1913 St Mary’s Ward, Conservative Councillor W.R.Boydell fighting for re-election in 1913 had no women helpers, despite there being a large Women’s Unionist Association in the ward.  The victor, Labour’s J.H. Wright, when praising the WLL canvassers, commented that Boydell had had to do "all the spade work himself".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 8 November 1913, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; W.R. Boydell and George Hunter, Liberal Councillor for St Mary’s in 1911, was a proven women’s suffragist.  In 1911, at the request of the NUWSS, Leigh Council was one of 146 County, Borough and District Councils , to petition Parliament in support of enfranchising women householders. In council, it was Councillor Hunter who moved the resolution with Councillor Boydell seconding.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Proceedings of the Council, 1910-1911 page 185 9 May 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider involvement== 

Throughout this period the NUWSS called on its member societies to take part in the mass demonstrations and rallies.  As a significant proportion of the participants were northern working women, prominent among these being [[pit brow women]] and mill workers, in all probability some Leigh women were represented.  Despite details of ordinary women’s personal involvement being hard to find, there is evidence that members of the Leigh Women’s Suffrage Society spent weeks making goods to sell on the Leigh, Wigan, Farnworth and Eccles stall at the 1912 NUWSS fund-raising bazaar at the [[Midland Hotel, Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal February 1912, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives +&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">[[File:83 Portrait of Frederick the Wise.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], who protected [[Martin Luther]], was a "lesser magistrate" under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].]]
The doctrine of the '''lesser magistrate''' is a concept in [[Protestant]] thought. A lesser magistrate is a ruler such as a prince who is under a greater ruler such as an emperor. According to many figures of the Reformation and Post-Reformation eras, the lesser magistrate has the authority to rebel against the tyranny of a supreme ruler.

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate finds its origin in [[John Calvin]], who wrote that whereas private Christians must submit to the ruling authorities, there are "popular magistrates" who have "been appointed to curb the tyranny of kings". When these magistrates "connive at kings when they tyrannise and insult over the humbler of the people" they "fraudulently betray the liberty of the people" when God has appointed them guardians of that liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Calvin]], ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xxi.html IV.xx.31].&lt;/ref&gt;

The lesser magistrate is prominent in the [[Lutheran]] ''[[Magdeburg Confession]]'' of 1550, which argued that the "subordinate powers" in a state, faced with the situation where the "supreme power" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wernham|first1=R. B.|title=Counter-Reformation and Price Revolution, 1559-1610|date=1968|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate became important for the justification of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. According to [[Johannes Althusius]] in 1603 work, ''Politica'', resistance to a supreme magistrate by lesser magistrates is justified in the case of tyranny. Althusius argued that the provincial authorities of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were in this situation.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Friedeburg, "Althusius," in ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Dutch Philosophers'', ed. W. van Bunge (Bristol, 2003), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary M. Simpson suggests that after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572 there was a "populist expansion" of the doctrine in which "the ruled would no longer be merely the subject of the ruler; they would become citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Simpson, "Toward a Lutheran "Delight in the Law of the Lord": Church and State in the Context of Civil Society," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn6CgUOOriUC&amp;pg=PA43 Church &amp; State: Lutheran Perspectives]'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Several regional characteristics can be observed:

* In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries as well as Britain and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberals on the centre and conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) further to their right.
* On the other hand, in countries strongly influenced by French political culture, such as Spain, Italy or Greece, economic liberalism was originally adopted in the 1830s by social conservatives; as a result, the 'niche' of liberalism is split between two distinct traditions:  'liberalism' itself is considered a centre-right, conservative philosophy, distinct from the centre-left political tradition of social-democratic and humanist liberalism known as Radicalism.

Often liberalism therefore involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to other [[centre-right politics|centre-right politic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;al traditions, such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

'''Liberal socialism''' is a [[Socialism|socialist]] [[political philosophy]] that incorporates [[Liberalism|liberal]] principles.&lt;ref name="Gerald F. Gaus 2004. p. 420"&gt;Gerald F. Gaus, Chandran Kukathas. ''Handbook of Political Theory''. SAGE Publications, 2004. p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal socialism does not have the goal of completely abolishing [[capitalism]] and replacing it with [[socialism]],&lt;ref name="Adams1998"&gt;Ian Adams. ''Ideology and Politics in Britain Today''. Manchester University Press, 1998. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; but it instead supports a [[mixed economy]] that includes both [[private property]] and [[social ownership]] in [[capital good]]s.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G. Pugliese 1999. p. 99"&gt;Pugliese, 1999, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noel W. Thompson 2006. p. 60-61"&gt;Thompson, 2006, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although liberal socialism unequivocally favors a mixed [[market economy]], it identifies legalistic and artificial [[Monopoly|monopolies]] to be the fault of capitalism&lt;ref&gt;Roland Willey Bartlett. ''The Success of Modern Private Enterprise''. Interstate Printers &amp; Publishers, 1970. p. 32. "Liberal socialism, for example, is unequivocally in favour of the free market economy and of freedom of action for the individual and recognizes in legalistic and artificial monopolies the real evils of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; and opposes an entirely unregulated economy.&lt;ref name=ref72&gt;Steve Bastow, James Martin. Third way discourse: European ideologies in the twentieth century. Edinburgh, Scotland, UK: Edinburgh University Press, Ltd, 2003. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; It considers both [[liberty]] and [[Social equality|equality]] to be compatible and mutually dependent on each other.&lt;ref name="Gerald F. Gaus 2004. p. 420"/&gt;

Principles that can be described as liberal socialist are based on the works of philosophers such as [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[John Dewey]], [[Carlo Rosselli]], [[Norberto Bobbio]], [[Chantal Mouffe]] and [[Karl Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Urbinati. ''J.S. Mill's Political Thought: A Bicentennial Reassessment''. Cambridge University Press, 2007. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important liberal socialist figures include [[Guido Calogero]], [[Piero Gobetti]], [[Leonard Hobhouse]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[R. H. Tawney]]. To Polanyi, liberal socialism's goal was overcoming exploitative aspects of capitalism by expropriation of landlords and opening to all the opportunity to own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=l3m0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=liberal+socialism+polanyi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PvsiUEGTQg&amp;sig=PS0zqDW1gQAmXDxniPKF7qquJTk&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikouzyzLHUAhVGFpAKHTM3AlEQ6AEIRTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=liberal+socialism+polanyi&amp;f=false|title=Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left|first=Gareth|last=Dale|date=14 June 2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal socialism has been particularly prominent in British and Italian politics.&lt;ref name= ref72/&gt;

Liberal socialism’s seminal ideas can be traced to John Stuart Mill, who theorised that capitalist societies should experience a gradual process of [[socialisation]] through [[Cooperative|worker-controlled enterprises]], coexisting with [[private enterprise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470594x03002002004&lt;/ref&gt; Mill rejected [[Centralisation|centralised]] models of socialism that could discourage competition and creativity, but he argued that representation is essential in a free government and democracy could not subsist if economic opportunities were not well distributed, therefore conceiving democracy not just as form of representative government, but as an entire social organisation.&lt;ref&gt;https://periodicos.ufsc.br/index.php/ethic/article/viewFile/1677-2954.2010v9n1p17/18741&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Stuart Mill ====
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], influential 19th century English thinker of [[liberalism]] who adopted some [[Socialism|socialist]] views]]
The main liberal English thinker [[John Stuart Mill]]'s early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626225342/http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill originally believed that "equality of taxation" meant "[[equality of sacrifice]]" and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore "a mild form of robbery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf "IREF | Pour la liberte economique et la concurrence fiscale"] (PDF). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327011315/http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes—some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.&lt;ref&gt;(Strasser, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mill, John Stuart and Bentham, Jeremy edited by Ryan, Alan.|title=Utilitarianism and other essays|edition=|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-14-043272-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Fred|title=John Stuart Mill: Political Economy|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|year=2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#PolEco|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on "unearned" incomes, which he favoured; and those on "earned" incomes, which he did not favour.&lt;ref name="principles online"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|title=On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14|work=Principles of Political Economy|publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]]|year=1852|url=}} (3rd edition; the passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition, which is acknowledged in this online edition's footnote 8: "This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: 'It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery'").&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ekelund, Robert B. Jr.|author2=Hébert, Robert F.|title=A history of economic theory and method|edition=4th|publisher=Waveland Press [Long Grove, Illinois]|year=1997|isbn=1-57766-381-0|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching. In the case of [[Oxford University]], it was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|''Principles of Economics'']].

At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]], saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, IV.7.21. John Stuart Mill: Political Economy, IV.7.21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Ethical socialism ====
[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]
Liberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;John Dearlove, Peter Saunders. ''Introduction to British Politics''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= ref52&gt;Thompson, 2006, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially-responsible]] [[private enterprise]].&lt;ref name="Noel W. Thompson 2006. p. 60-61"/&gt; Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2006, p. 52, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

It emphasizes the need for a morally-conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].&lt;ref name= ref58&gt;Thompson, 2006, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.&lt;ref name= ref52 /&gt; He opposed what he called the "acquisitive society" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to "functionless owners"—[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].&lt;ref name= ref58 /&gt; However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.&lt;ref name= ref58 /&gt; He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2006, p. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tawney advocated nationalization of strategic industries and services.&lt;ref name= ref59&gt;Thompson, 2006, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.&lt;ref name= ref59 /&gt; Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.&lt;ref name="Noel W. Thompson 2006. p. 60-61"/&gt; Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed "[[property rights]] of the few" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.&lt;ref name= ref35&gt;Carter, 2003, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.&lt;ref name="David Howell 2006"&gt;David Howell. ''Attlee''. Haus Publishing Ltd, 2006. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of "social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community".&lt;ref name="Stephen D. Tansey 2008. p. 97"&gt;Stephen D. Tansey, Nigel A. Jackson. ''Politics: The Basics''. Fourth Edition. Routledge, 2008. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),&lt;ref name= Carter&gt;Carter, 2003, p. 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents—with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.&lt;ref name= Carter /&gt; Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.&lt;ref name= ref72 /&gt; However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Faucher-King, Patrick Le Galès, Gregory Elliott. ''The New Labour Experiment: Change and Reform Under Blair and Brown''. Stanford University Press, 2010. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969–1974)]]
An early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].&lt;ref name=ref238&gt;Kevin Rep. ''Reformers, critics, and the paths of German modernity: anti-politics and the search for alternatives, 1890–1914''. Harvard University Press, 2000. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: "As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]—as perfect or imperfect as it might be—continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer".&lt;ref name=ref238 /&gt;

In the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Edinger, 1956, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curt Geyer]], a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]]—liberal [[democratic socialism]] and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Edinger, 1956, p. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon ''freiheitlicher Sozialismus'' (liberal socialism).&lt;ref name="Dietrich Orlow 2000. p. 108"&gt;Dietrich Orlow. ''Common destiny:a comparative history of the Dutch, French, and German social democratic parties, 1945–1969''. Berghahn Books, 2000. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.&lt;ref name="Stephen Eric Bronner 1999. p. 104"&gt;Stephen Eric Bronner.

=== Italy ===
{{main|Giustizia e Libertà|Action Party (Italy)}}
[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]
Italian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as "organized liberalism". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger. ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism.'' Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G. Pugliese 1999. p. 99"/&gt; While appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasized liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of "bourgeois capitalism".&lt;ref name="Stanislao G. Pugliese 1999. p. 51"&gt;Pugliese, 1999, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.&lt;ref name= ref53&gt;Pugliese, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: "The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially—collectivist, centralizing socialism—has been defeated".&lt;ref name= ref53/&gt; Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.&lt;ref name= ref5960&gt;Pugliese, 1999, p. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].&lt;ref name=Dombroski&gt;Zygmunt G. Barański, Rebecca J. West. "Socialism, Communism, and other 'isms'" by Robert S. Dombroski, ''The Cambridge companion to modern Italian culture''. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.&lt;ref name=Dombroski/&gt; Rosselli founded the ''[[Giustizia e Libertà]]'' (Justice and Liberty) movement as an [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].&lt;ref name= ref224&gt;James D. Wilkinson. ''The Intellectual Resistance Movement in Europe''. Harvard University Press, 1981. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferruccio Parri—who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]—and [[Sandro Pertini]]—who later became [[President of Italy]]—were among ''Giustizia e Libertà's'' leaders.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G. Pugliese 1999. p. 51"/&gt; ''Giustizia e Libertà'' was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Di Scala. ''Italian socialism: between politics and history''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1996. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.&lt;ref name=Dombroski /&gt;

[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978–1985)]]
After Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by [[Guido Calogero]].&lt;ref name = ref84&gt;[[Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira]]. ''Democracy and public management reform: building the republican state''. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology of "liberalsocialism" that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.&lt;ref name=ref84/&gt; Calogero created the "First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism" in 1940 that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.}}

After World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.&lt;ref name= ref5960 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ref236&gt;Pugliese, 1999, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.&lt;ref name= ref236 /&gt;

=== Belgium ===
[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.&lt;ref name= ref39&gt;María José Coperiás Aguilar. ''Culture and power: challenging discourses''. English edition. Valencia, Spain: Valencia University Press, Ltd., 2000. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole. This is where the socialist tradition of thought might still have something to contribute to the democratic project and herein lies the promise of a liberal socialism.}}

=== Hungary ===
In 1919, the Hungarian politician [[Oszkár Jászi]] declared his support for what he termed "liberal socialism" while denouncing "communist socialism".&lt;ref name=Litvan&gt;Litván, 2006, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, Jászi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a "radical middle-class".&lt;ref name=Litvan /&gt; His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the [[Bolshevik]] revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], calling his views "Anti-Marx". His criticism of Marxism was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology:&lt;ref&gt;Litván, 2006, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|In no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and [[amorality|amoral]] [[nihilism]]. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found.}}

Jászi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.&lt;ref name=Litvan /&gt; He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.&lt;ref name= ref200&gt;Litván, 2006, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jászi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik Communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under Communist rule.&lt;ref name=ref200 /&gt;

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

But they do share a common—or at least an overlapping—intellectual ancestry."&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''libertarianism'' was a term for a form of [[left-wing politics]]; such [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] ideologies seek to [[Anti-capitalism|abolish capitalism]] and [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], or else to restrict their purview or effects, in favor of [[Common ownership|common]] or [[Worker cooperative|cooperative ownership]] and [[Workers' self-management|management]], viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty.&lt;ref name="wrmiller"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Le libertaire 25.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The 17 August 1860 edition of ''Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social'', a [[libertarian communist]] publication in New York]]
The first recorded use of the term "libertarian" was in 1789, when [[William Belsham]] wrote about [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] in the context of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Belsham|title=Essays|publisher=C. Dilly|year=1789|postscript=Original from the University of Michigan, digitized May 21, 2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z6Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=William+Belsham+libertarian|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libertarian" came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, especially in the political and social spheres, as early as 1796, when the London Packet printed on 12 February: "Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians".&lt;ref&gt;OED November 2010 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The word was again used in a political sense in 1802 in a short piece critiquing a poem by "the author of Gebir" and has since been used with this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120802021008/http://archive.mises.org/18385/the-origin-of-libertarianism The British Critic]''. p. 432. "The author's Latin verses, which are rather more intelligible than his English, mark him for a furious Libertarian (if we may coin such a term) and a zealous admirer of France, and her liberty, under Bonaparte; such liberty!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robert Seeley|Seeley, John Robert]] (1878). ''Life and Times of Stein: Or Germany and Prussia in the Napoleonic Age''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 3: 355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick William Maitland|Maitland, Frederick William]] (July 1901). "William Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford". ''[[English Historical Review]]''. 16[.3]: 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "libertarian" to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, ''libertaire'', coined in a letter French libertarian communist [[Joseph Déjacque]] wrote to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon"] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). p. 641. "The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sebastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas|volume=Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE–1939)|year=2005|location=Montreal|publisher=Black Rose Books|editor=Robert Graham|chapter=|author=|at=§17|editor-link=Robert Graham (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication ''Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social'', which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"He called himself a "social poet," and published two volumes of heavily didactic verse—Lazaréennes and Les Pyrénées Nivelées. In New York, from 1858 to 1861, he edited an anarchist paper entitled ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'',  in whose pages he printed as a serial his vision of the anarchist Utopia, entitled L'Humanisphére."

In the mid-1890s, [[Sébastien Faure]] began publishing a new ''Le Libertaire'' while France's [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] enacted the ''[[lois scélérates]]'' ("villainous laws"), which banned anarchist publications in France. ''Libertarianism'' has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time.&lt;ref name=nettlau&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau|first=Max|authorlink=Max Nettlau|year=1996|publisher=Freedom Press|isbn=978-0-900384-89-9|language=English|location=London|page=162|oclc=37529250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Ward (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kksrWshoIkYC ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''], Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], p. 62. "For a century, anarchists have used the word 'libertarian' as a synonym for 'anarchist', both as a noun and an adjective. The celebrated anarchist journal Le Libertaire was founded in 1896.

The term "libertarianism" was first used in the United States as a synonym for [[classical liberalism]] in May 1955 by writer Dean Russell, a colleague of [[Leonard Read]] and a classical liberal himself.

He justified the choice of the word as follows: "Many of us call ourselves 'liberals.' And it is true that the word 'liberal' once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding. Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word 'libertarian'".&lt;ref name=FEE&gt;[https://fee.org/articles/where-does-the-term-libertarian-come-from-anyway/ "Where Does the Term "Libertarian" Come From Anyway?"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a growing number of Americans with [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] beliefs in the United States began to describe themselves as "libertarian". One person responsible for popularizing the term "libertarian" in this sense was [[Murray Rothbard]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cantor]], ''The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture: Liberty Vs. Authority in American Film and TV'', University Press of Kentucky, 2012, p. 353, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s.  Rothbard describes this modern use of the words overtly as a 'capture' from his enemies, saying that "...for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over..."&lt;ref name="CubanAnarchism"&gt;Fernandez, Frank (2001). ''Cuban Anarchism. The History of a Movement''. Sharp Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jKdztbIaHegC p. 9]. "Thus, in the United States, the once exceedingly useful term 'libertarian' has been hijacked by egotists who are in fact enemies of liberty in the full sense of the word."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RothbardBetrayal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothbard|first1=Murray N.|title=The Betrayal of the American Right|date=2009|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=1610165012|quote=One gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that, for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy...

[[Libertarianism in the United States]] has been described as [[Fiscal conservatism|conservative on economic issues]] and [[Cultural liberalism|liberal on personal freedom]]&lt;ref name="BoazKirby06a"&gt;Boaz, David; Kirby, David (18 October 2006).

== Philosophy ==
There is contention about whether left and right libertarianism "represent distinct ideologies as opposed to variations on a theme".&lt;ref name="geodist"&gt;Carlson (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1006&amp;dq=right-libertarianism&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=right-libertarianism p. 1007]. "In contrast to the United States, where a right-libertarian sensibility dominates, western European nations with strong leftist political parties tend to see the emergence of left-libertarian parties, as detailed by Kent Redding and Jocelyn S. Viterna. According to them, these parties are united by their 'critique of the statist and bureaucratic tendencies of modern welfare states... inequality and environmental degradation produced by capitalist market economies.'"&lt;/ref&gt;  All libertarians begin with a conception of [[Autonomy|personal autonomy]] from which they argue in favor of civil liberties and a reduction or elimination of the state.

[[Left-libertarianism]] encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the Earth's natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.  Contemporary left-libertarians such as [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Peter Vallentyne]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Michael Otsuka]] and [[David Ellerman]] believe the appropriation of land must leave "[[Lockean proviso|enough and as good]]" for others or be taxed by society to compensate for the exclusionary effects of private property. [[Libertarian socialist]]s ([[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchist]]s, [[libertarian Marxist]]s, [[council communist]]s, [[Luxemburgist]]s and [[DeLeonist]]s) promote [[usufruct]] and [[socialist]] economic theories, including [[communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[syndicalism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].  They criticize the state for being the defender of private property and believe capitalism entails [[wage slavery]].

[[Right-libertarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Rothbard and Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition." Goodway, David (2006).

=== Personal autonomy ===
{{anchor|Personal autonomy}}
Anarchism envisages freedom as a form of autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] describes as "the ability to initiate a task and do it one's own way, without orders from authorities who do not know the actual problem and the available means".&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Paul (1972). ''Little Prayers and Finite Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt;  All anarchists oppose political and legal authority, but collectivist strains also oppose the economic authority of private property.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009. pp. 42-43"&gt;Marshall (2009). pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; These social anarchists emphasize mutual aid, whereas individualist anarchists extol individual sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some right-libertarians consider the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) to be a core part of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/the-morality-of-libertarianism/|title=The Morality of Libertarianism |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/block/block26.html|title=The Non-Aggression Axiom of Libertarianism|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil liberties ===
[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|thumb|upright|left|American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], prominent [[anarcha-feminist]], [[free love]] and [[freethought]] activist]]

Free love appeared alongside [[anarcha-feminism]] and advocacy of [[LGBT rights]]. Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism and views [[patriarchy]] as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late-19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Virginia Bolten]].

Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender roles]]. ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand'', 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was an anarchist newspaper in the United States that staunchly advocated free love and women's rights, while criticizing "[[comstockery]]", the censorship of sexual information.&lt;ref name="Goldman-MSF-551"&gt;''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909''. p. 551. "''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, anarchism has also voiced opinions and taken action around certain sex-related subjects such as pornography,&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Boston_Anarchist_Drinking_Brigade__An_Anarchist_Defense_of_Pornography.html|title=An Anarchist Defense of Pornography by Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade|publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM]]&lt;ref name="bdsm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.interactivist.net/node/1530|title=Interview with an Anarchist Dominatrix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218152800/http://info.interactivist.net/node/1530|archivedate=18 December 2002|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref name="bdsm"/&gt;

A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism.

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler|date=Spring–Summer 1985|title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia"|journal=History of Education Quarterly|volume=25|issue=1/2|pages=103–132|doi=10.2307/368893|jstor=368893|publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", i.e. education free from the authority of the church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html|title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School|publisher=Flag.blackened.net|accessdate=20 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html|archivedate=7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".

Later in the 20th century, Austrian [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[Wilhelm Reich]] became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sex-counseling clinics in Vienna for working-class patients&lt;ref&gt;Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Danto writes that Reich offered a mixture of "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help. Danto, Elizabeth Ann (2007). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis &amp; Social Justice'', 1918–1938, Columbia University Press, first published 2005., pp. 118–120, 137, 198, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as coining the phrase "[[sexual revolution]]" in one of his books from the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;The Sexual Revolution, 1945 (Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf, translated by Theodore P. Wolfe)&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s, the English anarchist and pacifist [[Alex Comfort]] achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' and ''More Joy of Sex''.

=== State ===
Many left-libertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy: "As Robert Paul Wolff has argued, since 'the state is authority, the right to rule', anarchism which rejects the State is the only political doctrine consistent with autonomy in which the individual alone is the judge of his moral constraints".&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009. pp. 42-43"/&gt; Social anarchists believe the state defends private property, which they view as intrinsically harmful, while [[Left-wing market anarchism|market-oriented left-libertarians]] argue that so-called free markets actually consist of economic privileges granted by the state. These latter libertarians advocate instead for freed markets, which are freed from these privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, Gary. Johnson, Charles W. (2011). ''Markets Not Capitalism: Individualist Anarchism Against Bosses, Inequality, Corporate Power, and Structural Poverty''. Minor Compositions. p. 1. {{ISBN|978-1570272424}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate amongst right-libertarians as to whether or not the state is legitimate: while anarcho-capitalists advocate its abolition, minarchists support minimal states, often referred to as night-watchman states. Libertarians take a skeptical view of government authority.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=22 May 2009|url=http://media.libsyn.com/media/pointofinquiry/POI_2009_05_22_Michael_Shermer.mp3|title=Michael Shermer – Science, Skepticism and Libertarianism|work=[[Point of Inquiry]]|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}} Minarchists maintain that the state is necessary for the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, [[breach of contract]] and fraud. They believe the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police and [[courts]], though some expand this list to include [[fire department]]s, [[prison]]s and the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]] branches.&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;Gregory, Anthory.[http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/gregory/gregory6.html The Minarchist's Dilemma]. ''[[Strike The Root]]''. 10 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

They justify the state on the grounds that it is the [[logical consequence]] of adhering to the non-aggression principle and argue that anarchism is immoral because it implies that the non-aggression principle is optional, that the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competition.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another common justification is that [[private defense]] agencies and [[Dispute resolution organizations|court]] firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705120549/http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists argue that the state violates the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) by its nature because governments use force against those who have not stolen or vandalized private property, assaulted anyone or committed fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick Long|Long, Roderick]], [http://praxeology.net/Anarconst2.pdf Market Anarchism as Constitutionalism], ''[http://praxeology.net/anarcres.htm Molinari Institute]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plauché, Geoffrey Allan (2006).

=== Property rights ===
Left-libertarians believe that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (2012). p. 1007. "[Left-libertarians] disagree with right-libertarians with respect to property rights, arguing instead that individuals have no inherent right to natural resources. Namely, these resources must be treated as collective property that is made available on an egalitarian basis."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narveson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-first=Ronald|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|pages=288–289|doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n174|isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4|lccn=2008009151|oclc=750831024|quote=[Left libertarians] regard each of us as full self-owners.

"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/ Libertarianism]". In ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. [[Stanford University]]. Retrieved 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-libertarians maintain that unowned natural resources "may be appropriated by the first person who discovers them, [[Labor theory of property|mixes his labor with them]], or merely claims them—without the consent of others, and with little or no payment to them". They believe that natural resources are originally unowned and therefore private parties may appropriate them at will without the consent of, or owing to, others.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Lawrence C.; Becker, Charlotte B.

=== Economics ===
Left-libertarians (social and individualist anarchists, libertarian Marxists and left-wing market anarchists) argue in favor of socialist theories such as communism, syndicalism and mutualism ([[anarchist economics]]). Daniel Guérin writes that "anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State".&lt;ref name="Guérin 1970"&gt;Guérin (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-libertarians are [[economic liberal]]s of either the [[Austrian School]] or [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] and support ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mises.org/library/classical-liberalism-and-austrian-school-0|title=Classical Liberalism and the Austrian School|last=Raico|first=Ralph|date=2012|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610160032|location=Auburn, Alabama|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage labor ===
[[Wage labor]] has long been compared by socialists and [[anarcho-syndicalist]]s to slavery.&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term "wage slavery" is often utilized as a pejorative for wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007a}}.&lt;br&gt;The term is not without its critics, as {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007b|p=247}}, notes: "[T]he challenge to loose connections of wage (or white) slavery to chattel slavery was led by [[Frederick Douglass]] and other Black, often fugitive, abolitionists. Their challenge was mercilessly concrete. Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and [[William Wells Brown]] did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply. They noted, for example, that their escapes from slavery had left job openings and wondered if any white workers wanted to take the jobs."&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital"&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ECdb7EjiBnEC&amp;pg=PR16 xvi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually ''worse'' than [[chattel slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carsel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery apologists like [[George Fitzhugh]] contended that workers only accepted wage labor with the passage of time, as they became "familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale[d]".&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''On the Limits of State Action'', classical liberal thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the laborer works under external control "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DIpW10rWZFAC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1006}}: "[L]abor-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself."&lt;/ref&gt; provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Another one, of course, being the capitalists' theft from workers via [[surplus-value]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It can be persuasively argued", noted philosopher John Nelson, "that the conception of the worker's labor as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=John O.|year=1995|title=That a Worker's Labour Cannot Be a Commodity|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=70|issue=272|page=158|jstor=3751199|ref=harv|doi=10.1017/s0031819100065359}}. This Marxist objection is what motivated Nelson's essay, which argues that labur is not, in fact, a commodity.&lt;/ref&gt;

That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labor is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a class dependent on wages, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}. Emphasis in the original.&lt;br&gt;See also p. 716: "[T]he capitalist produces [and reproduces] the worker as a wage-laborer. This incessant reproduction, this perpetuation of the worker, is the absolutely necessary condition for capitalist production."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent currents ==
=== Left-libertarianism ===
{{main|Left-libertarianism}}
Left-libertarianism (or classical libertarianism) names several related, but distinct approaches to [[political]] and social theory which stresses both [[Political freedom|individual freedom]] and [[social equality]]. In its classical usage, left-libertarianism is a synonym for [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] varieties of [[left-wing politics]], i.e. [[libertarian socialism]], which includes [[anarchism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]], among others.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"&gt;Anarchism". In Gaus, Gerald F.; D'Agostino, Fred, eds. (2012). ''The Routledge Companion to Social and Political Philosophy''. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookchinreader"&gt;Bookchin, Murray and Biehl, Janet (1997). ''The Murray Bookchin Reader''. Cassell: p. 170. {{ISBN|0-304-33873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-libertarianism can also refer to political positions associated with academic philosophers [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and [[Peter Vallentyne]] that combine [[self-ownership]] with an egalitarian approach to natural resources.&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"&gt;[[Will Kymlicka|Kymlicka, Will]] (2005). "libertarianism, left-". In [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. New York City: [[Oxford University Press]].  p. 516.  {{ISBN|978-0199264797}}. "'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner."&lt;/ref&gt;

While maintaining full respect for [[personal property]], left-libertarians are skeptical of or fully against [[private property]], arguing that neither claiming nor [[Labor theory of property|mixing one's labor]] with [[natural resource]]s is enough to generate full [[Right to property|private property rights]]&lt;ref name="socialhistory"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D.

"Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land."&lt;/ref&gt; This position is contrasted with that of some versions of [[left-libertarianism]], which maintain that natural resources belong to everyone in an [[egalitarian]] manner, either unowned or [[owned collectively]].&lt;ref&gt;Vallentyne, Peter (2007).

"The best-known versions of libertarianism are right-libertarian theories, which hold that agents have a very strong moral power to acquire full private property rights in external things. Left-libertarians, by contrast, hold that natural resources (e.g., space, land, minerals, air, and water) belong to everyone in some egalitarian manner and thus cannot be appropriated without the consent of, or significant payment to, the members of society."&lt;/ref&gt; Right-libertarianism includes [[anarcho-capitalism]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[minarchist]] [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;* Marshall, Peter (2008).

"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing ''laissez-faire'' philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition".

"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions—the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions—neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all".&lt;/ref&gt;

Such free-standing farmers, Jefferson thought, were the basis of a vigorous and independent public sphere where citizens could speak their mind without fear or favor. Somewhere in between these two poles lies the contemporary situation of most citizens of Western democracies: a relatively open public sphere but a quotidian institutional experience that is largely at cross purposes with the implicit assumptions behind this public sphere and encouraging and often rewarding caution, deference, servility, and conformity."&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Paine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Roderick T|year=1998|title=Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class|url=|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|volume=15|issue=2|page=310|doi=10.1017/s0265052500002028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Thomas Paine]]]]
John Locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]], especially ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' (1667), ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) and ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690). In the text of 1689, he established the basis of liberal political theory: that people's rights existed before government; that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights; that people may dissolve governments that do not do so; and that representative government is the best form to protect rights.&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''The Libertarian Reader: Classic and Contemporary Writings from Lao Tzu to Milton Friedman'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMs6OaHu6iEC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=John+Locke+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Locke%20libertarian p. 123], {{ISBN|1439118337}}, {{ISBN|9781439118337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was inspired by Locke in its statement: "[T]o secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it".&lt;ref name=Rothbard1&gt;Murray Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism], excerpted from Rothbard's ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'', 1973; published at [[LewRockwell.com]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] says that "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to Lockean individualism... and non-Lockean individualism may encompass socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972. {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Murray Rothbard, the libertarian creed emerged from the classical liberal challenges to an "absolute central State and a king ruling by divine right on top of an older, restrictive web of feudal land monopolies and urban guild controls and restrictions", the [[mercantilism]] of a bureaucratic warfaring state allied with privileged merchants. The object of classical liberals was individual liberty in the economy, in personal freedoms and civil liberty, separation of state and religion, and peace as an alternative to imperial aggrandizement. He cites Locke's contemporaries, the Levellers, who held similar views. Also influential were the English "[[Cato's Letters]]" during the early 1700s, reprinted eagerly by [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonists]] who already were free of European aristocracy and feudal land monopolies.&lt;ref name=Rothbard1/&gt;

In January of 1776, only two years after coming to America from England, Thomas Paine published his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' calling for independence for the colonies.&lt;ref name=Sprading&gt;Charles T. Sprading, ''Liberty and the Great Libertarians'', 1913; republished 1995 by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=STQJ_DjQuw8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Thomas+Paine+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Paine%20libertarian p. 74], {{ISBN|1610161076}}, {{ISBN|9781610161077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine promoted classical liberal ideas in clear, concise language that allowed the general public to understand the debates among the political elites.&lt;ref&gt;David C.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]] wrote a libertarian philosophical treatise, ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Morals and Happiness]]'', which criticized ideas of human rights and of society by contract based on vague promises. He took classical liberalism to its logical anarchic conclusion by rejecting all political institutions, law, government and apparatus of coercion as well as all political protest and insurrection. Instead of institutionalized justice, Godwin proposed that people influence one another to moral goodness through informal reasoned persuasion, including in the associations they joined as this would facilitate happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oeZ226OlfbkC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=Political+Ideology+Today+william+godwin+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20Ideology%20Today%20william%20godwin%20libertarian p. 305], {{ISBN|0521440866}}, {{ISBN|9780521440868}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Happiness]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|publisher=G.G. and J.

=== Rise of anarchism ===
{{main|History of anarchism}}
[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work",&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence..." – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in ''Political Justice'' (1793)&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, Godwin advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=godwin|title=William Godwin|last=Philip|first=Mark|date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|year=1796|publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson|oclc=2340417|origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement", the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. Godwin considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

In France, various anarchist currents were present during the Revolutionary period, with some revolutionaries using the term ''anarchiste'' in a positive light as early as September 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[enragés]]'' opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] dictatorship, [[Jean Varlet]] wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself".&lt;ref name=graham/&gt; In his "Manifesto of the Equals", [[Sylvain Maréchal]] looked forward to the disappearance, once and for all, of "the revolting distinction between rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Robert|chapter=Preface|title=[[Anarchism: a Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas: from Anarchy to Anarchism]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|location=Montréal|year=2005|isbn=1-55164-250-6|authorlink=Robert Graham (historian)|pages=xi–xiv|accessdate=11 August 2010|chapter-url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Bookchin]] wrote that the Spanish libertarian movement of the mid-1930s was unique because its workers' control and collectives—which came out of a three-generation "massive libertarian movement"—divided the republican camp and challenged the Marxists. "Urban anarchists" created libertarian communist forms of organization which evolved into the CNT, a syndicalist union providing the infrastructure for a libertarian society. Also formed were local bodies to administer social and economic life on a decentralized libertarian basis. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the 1930s Spanish Civil War against authoritarian and fascist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936'', AK Press, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1DzxkWr0X60C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=To+Remember+Spain:+The+Anarchist+and+Syndicalist+Revolution+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Libertarian pp. 2–39], {{ISBN|9781873176870}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guérin]] published an essay in 1969 called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[First International]] and afterwards suggested that "[L]ibertarian Marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian Marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralyzed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html|title=Libertarian Marxism? – The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, ''Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom,'' Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal.

=== Individualism in the United States ===
[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Josiah Warren]]]]
The indigenous anarchist tradition in the United States was largely [[Individualism|individualist]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall.  p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, Josiah Warren became aware of the social system of [[utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] and began to talk with others in Cincinnati about founding a [[communist]] colony.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Josiah (17 February 1872).  "The Motives for Communism—How It Worked and What It Led To".  ''Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly''.  '''IV''': 14.  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this group failed to come to an agreement about the form and goals of their proposed community, Warren "sold his factory after only two years of operation, packed up his young family, and took his place as one of 900 or so Owenites who had decided to become part of the founding population of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana".&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=February 25, 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5067/Josiah-Warren-The-First-American-Anarchist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren termed the phrase "[[cost the limit of price]]"&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Josiah.  ''Equitable Commerce''.  "A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''.  The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals..."&lt;/ref&gt; and "proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate2/&gt; He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental labor-for-labor store called the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where trade was facilitated by [[labor note]]s.

The store proved successful and operated for three years, after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism, including [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. "After New Harmony failed, Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html|title=Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy – The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist&lt;ref name=Slate2&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'' he edited during 1833 was the first anarchist periodical published,&lt;ref name="bailie20"/&gt; an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type and made his own printing plates.&lt;ref name="bailie20"/&gt;

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in [[European individualist anarchist]]s of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as [[Émile Armand]] and the [[intentional communities]] started by them.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721040723/http://www.tesisenxarxa.net/TESIS_UdG/AVAILABLE/TDX...//txdr1de2.pdf Xavier Diez.  ''L'ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923–1938'']  p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews, individualist anarchist and close associate, wrote the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories in ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madison|first1=Charles A.|year=1945|title=Anarchism in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=1|issue=6|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews was formerly associated with the [[Fourierist]] movement, but converted to radical individualism after becoming acquainted with the work of Warren. Like Warren, he held the principle of "individual sovereignty" as being of paramount importance. Contemporary American anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] reports: {{quote|Steven Pearl Andrews... was not a Fourierist, but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in America and adopted a lot of Fourierist principles and practices... a maker of worlds out of words.  He syncretized abolitionism in the United States, free love, spiritual universalism, Warren, and Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy...  He was instrumental in founding several 'intentional communities,' including the 'Brownstone Utopia' on 14th St. in New York, and 'Modern Times' in Brentwood, Long Island.  The latter became as famous as the best-known Fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey)—in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for 'Free Love') and finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity.  Andrews (and Victoria Woodhull) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, and spiritualist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey|Bey, Hakim]].  [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[it is apparent... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews.  William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;Schuster, Eunice Minette.  [http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html|date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Batchelder Greene was a 19th-century mutualist individualist anarchist, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, soldier and promoter of free banking in the United States. Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system; and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the New England philosophical school.

After 1850, he became active in labor reform.&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; "He was elected vice-president of the New England Labor Reform League, the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking, and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; Greene then published ''Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments'' (1875).&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; His "associationism... is checked by individualism... 'Mind your own business,' 'Judge not that ye be not judged.' Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces.  For this reason he demands 'mutuality' in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt;

Poet, naturalist and [[transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' (''Resistance to Civil Government''), an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. In ''Walden'', Thoreau advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock(8), esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."

''Civil Disobedience'', first published in 1849, argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. These works influenced [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[anarcho-pacifism]],&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; as well as figures including [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence|title=Resisting the nation state|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in [[John Zerzan]].

Early proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"/&gt; but the concept was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer [[Henry George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foldvary|first=Fred|title=Geoism Explained|url=http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|publisher=The Progress Report|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317210356/http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|archivedate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; George believed that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make, thus he was opposed to income taxes, sales taxes, taxes on improvements and all other taxes on production, labor, trade or commerce.

George was among the staunchest defenders of [[free market]]s and his book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was read into the U.S. Congressional Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/ei/ei0502.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he did support direct management of [[natural monopolies]] as a last resort, such as right-of-way monopolies necessary for railroads. George advocated for elimination of intellectual property arrangements in favor of government sponsored prizes for inventors.&lt;ref&gt;George, Henry. ''Progress and Poverty''.

Lysander Spooner, besides his individualist anarchist activism, was also an anti-slavery activist and member of the First International.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George (1962). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker argued that the elimination of what he called "the four monopolies"—the land monopoly, the money and banking monopoly, the monopoly powers conferred by patents and the quasi-monopolistic effects of tariffs—would undermine the power of the wealthy and big business, making possible widespread property ownership and higher incomes for ordinary people, while minimizing the power of would-be bosses and achieving socialist goals without state action. Tucker's anarchist periodical, ''Liberty'', was published from August 1881 to April 1908.

The publication, emblazoned with Proudhon's quote that liberty is "Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order" was instrumental in developing and formalizing the individualist anarchist philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a forum for debate. Contributors included Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner, [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], John Henry Mackay, [[Victor Yarros]], [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], [[James L.

They were well-informed and sometimes even learned, but there was never the slightest trace of pedantry in them".&lt;ref name="Mencken"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mencken|first1=H.L.|year=1926|title=The Immortal Democrat|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1926sep-00123|journal=American Mercury|volume=9|issue=33|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Vice President of the [[Cato Institute]], [[David Boaz]], writes: "In 1943, at one of the lowest points for liberty and humanity in history, three remarkable women published books that could be said to have given birth to the modern libertarian movement".&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David (1997).

New York: Free Press. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isabel Paterson]]'s ''[[The God of the Machine]]'', [[Rose Wilder Lane]]'s ''The Discovery of Freedom'' and [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' each promoted individualism and capitalism. None of the three used the term libertarianism to describe their beliefs and Rand specifically rejected the label, criticizing the burgeoning American libertarian movement as the "hippies of the right".&lt;ref name="ari"&gt;{{cite web|title=What was Ayn Rand's view of the libertarian movement?|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ar_libertarianism_qa|publisher=Ayn Rand Institute|quote=More specifically, I disapprove of, disagree with and have no connection with, the latest aberration of some conservatives, the so-called "hippies of the right," who attempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claiming simultaneously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism.

Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet libertarians combine capitalism and anarchism. That's worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It's a mockery of philosophy and ideology. They sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons. They want to be hippies, but don't want to preach collectivism because those jobs are already taken. But anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect. Anarchists are the scum of the intellectual world of the Left, which has given them up. So the Right picks up another leftist discard. That's the libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Robert (2005). ''Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q &amp; A''.  p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Austrian school]] economist Murray Rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism,&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo, Justin (2001). ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard''. Amherst, NY: Prometheus.&lt;/ref&gt; but long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions.

Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon, David (1978). ''[[The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism]]''. [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].  p. 127. "only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in ''Power and Market'', and some article writers were influenced by [past anarchists like Spooner and Tucker]. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to meld their advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1965, 2000).  "[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View]". ''Journal of Libertarian Studies''. '''20''':1. p. 7. "There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics,' a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung [worldview]".&lt;/ref&gt; This new philosophy he called anarcho-capitalism.

[[Karl Hess]], a speechwriter for [[Barry Goldwater]] and primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 [[Party platform|platforms]], became disillusioned with traditional politics following the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]] in which Goldwater lost to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He parted with the Republicans altogether after being rejected for employment with the party, and began work as a heavy-duty welder. Hess began reading American anarchists largely due to the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard and said that upon reading the works of communist anarchist Emma Goldman, he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent. For Hess, Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of [[Ayn Rand]] without any of the "crazy [[solipsism]] that Rand was so fond of".&lt;ref&gt;Fischler, Steven (Director); Sucher, Joel (Director) (1983). ''Anarchism in America'' (DVD). Pacific Street Films. "I was just amazed.  When I read Emma Goldman, it was as though everything I had hoped that the Republican Party would stand for suddenly came out—crystallized—in this magnificently clear statement."&lt;/ref&gt; Hess and Rothbard founded the journal ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'', which was published from 1965 to 1968, with George Resch and [[Leonard P. Liggio]]. In 1969, they edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' 1969, which Hess left in 1971.  Hess eventually put his focus on the small scale, stating that "Society is: people together making culture". He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be "opposition to central political authority" and "concern for people as individuals". His rejection of standard American [[party politics]] was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said: "The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy".&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Roland; Ladue, Peter (1980). ''Karl Hess: Toward Liberty''. Direct Cinema, Ltd. [M16 2824 K].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vietnam War]] split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of American libertarians and conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the [[draft dodger|draft resistance]] and [[peace movement]]s, as well as organizations such as [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, [[Robert LeFevre]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] and former SDS leader [[Carl Oglesby]] to speak at two "left-right" conferences which brought together activists from both the Old Right and the New Left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110708090610/http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archivedate=2011-07-08|title=Spangler Home Improvement Tips – Smart home improvement decisions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his effort to unite right and left-libertarianism, Hess would join the SDS as well as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained: "We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now.  If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, 'What happened to the blacks? Why aren't they militant anymore?'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/from_far_right_to_far_left.html ''From Far Right to Far Left– and Farther– With Karl Hess''] by James Boyd: 1970 ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning [[paleoconservative]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;See Raimondo 277–78; Doherty 562–565.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the tendency of these [[left-libertarian]]s to appeal to "'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves" in contrast to "the bulk of Americans," who "might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc".&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, letter to David Bergland, June 5, 1986, qtd. Raimondo 263–264. Rothbard emphasized that this was relevant as a matter of strategy: the failure to pitch the libertarian message to Middle America, he wrote, might result in the loss of "the tight-assed majority."&lt;/ref&gt; This left-libertarian tradition has been carried to the present day by Samuel Edward Konkin III's [[agorist]]s, contemporary mutualists such as [[Kevin Carson]] and Roderick T.

In 1971, a small group of Americans led by [[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]] formed the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Bill Winter, [http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/cp3/message/9701 "1971–2001: The Libertarian Party's 30th Anniversary Year: Remembering the first three decades of America's 'Party of Principle'"]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} LP News&lt;/ref&gt; which has run a presidential candidate every election year since 1972.

Modern libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of Harvard University professor [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974, for which he received a National Book Award in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;National Book Foundation. "[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html National Book Awards: 1975 – Philosophy and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909065656/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html|date=9 September 2011}}"&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', Nozick's book supported a [[Night-watchman state|minimal state]] (also called a nightwatchman state by Nozick) on the grounds that the ultraminimal state arises without violating [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, David Lewis (30 April 2008). "[http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia]". ''[[The New York Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state is morally obligated to occur. Specifically, Nozick writes, "We argue that the first transition from a system of private protective agencies to an ultraminimal state, will occur by an invisible-hand process in a morally permissible way that violates no one's rights. Secondly, we argue that the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state morally must occur. It would be morally impermissible for persons to maintain the monopoly in the ultraminimal state without providing protective services for all, even if this requires specific 'redistribution.'  The operators of the ultraminimal state are morally obligated to produce the minimal state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|last=Nozick|first=Robert|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn= 978-0-465-05100-7|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Rothbard wrote that "[o]ne gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that, for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (2009).  ''The Betrayal of the American Right''. Ludwig von Mises Institute. {{ISBN|1610165012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the project of spreading libertarian ideals in the United States has been so successful that some Americans who don't identify as "libertarian" seem to hold libertarian views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640625|title=Peak Oil: Apocalyptic Environmentalism and Libertarian Political Culture|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|isbn=9780226285573|location=Chicago|oclc=922640625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, this modern American libertarianism has spread beyond North America via think tanks and political parties.&lt;ref name="teles2008diffusion"&gt;Teles, Steven; Kenney, Daniel A.

He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 60s. As Farrell puts it, "Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade."[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 "The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism" by James J. Farrell].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"While not always formally recognized, much of the protest of the sixties was anarchist. Within the nascent women's movement, anarchist principles became so widespread that a political science professor denounced what she saw as "The Tyranny of Structurelessness." Several groups have called themselves "Amazon Anarchists."

Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement." [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the International of Anarchist Federations was founded in Carrara, Italy during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Italian]] and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref name="Short history of the IAF-IFA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The uprisings of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/ir/122_conferences|title=The International Conferences of the Communist Left (1976–80) &amp;#124; International Communist Current|publisher=En.internationalism.org|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of left communist internationals|Left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Party]], International Communist Current and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] and [[Squatting|squatter]] movements like that of [[Barcelona]], Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the [[Freetown Christiania]], an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.

Around the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{cite book|page=66|last=Rupert|first=Mark|title=Globalization and International Political Economy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham|year=2006|isbn=0-7425-2943-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s and other organizational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralized technologies such as the Internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; For English anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding (2007)|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

Libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, squatter movement; [[social centers]]; [[infoshop]]s; anti-poverty groups such as [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]; [[Leasehold estate|tenants']] unions; [[housing cooperative]]s; [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] generally and [[egalitarian communities]]; anti-sexist organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in [[participatory economics]]; [[anti-racist]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups like [[Anti-Racist Action]] and [[Anti-Fascist Action]]; activist groups protecting the rights of immigrants and promoting the free movement of people, such as the [[No Border network]]; [[worker co-operative]]s, [[countercultural]] and artist groups; and the peace movement.

In the United States, polls (circa 2006) find that the views and voting habits of between 10 and 20 percent (and increasing) of voting age Americans may be classified as "fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or libertarian".&lt;ref name="BoazKirby06"&gt;''The Libertarian Vote'' by David Boaz and David Kirby, Cato Institute, October 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anes2004"&gt;''The ANES Guide to Public Opinion and Electoral Behavior, 1948–2004'' American National Election Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on pollsters and researchers defining libertarian views as fiscally conservative and socially liberal (based on the common United States meanings of the terms) and against government intervention in economic affairs and for expansion of personal freedoms.&lt;ref name="BoazKirby06"/&gt; Through 20 polls on this topic spanning 13 years, Gallup found that voters who are libertarian on the political spectrum ranged from 17–23% of the United States electorate.&lt;ref name="Gallup2006"&gt;Gallup Poll news release, September 7–10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2014 Pew Poll found that 23% of Americans who identify as libertarians have no idea what the word means.&lt;ref&gt;Kiley, Jocelyn (25 August 2014).

"14% say the term libertarian describes them well; 77% of those know the definition (11% of total), while 23% do not (3% of total)."&lt;/ref&gt;

2009 saw the rise of the [[Tea Party movement]], an American political movement known for advocating a reduction in the United States national debt and federal budget deficit by reducing government spending and taxes, which had a significant libertarian component&lt;ref name=libertarian&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-roots-tea-party?mc_cid=6b9d637298&amp;mc_eid=a1708a475b|title=Libertarian Roots of the Tea Party|last=Kirby|first=David|last2=Ekins|first2=Emily McClintock|publisher=Cato|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having contrasts with libertarian values and views in some areas, such as nationalism, [[free trade]], social issues and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Libertarianism What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Brennan|first=Jason|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=142–42|quote=Is the Tea Party libertarian? Overall, the Tea Party movement is not libertarian, though it has many libertarian elements, and many libertarians are Tea Partiers. [...] They share the libertarian view that DC tends to be corrupt, and that Washington often promotes special interests at the expense of the common good. However, Tea Party members are predominantly populist, nationalist, social conservatives rather than libertarians. Polls indicate that most Tea Partiers believe government should have an active role in promoting traditional "family values" or conservative Judeo-Christian values. Many of them oppose free trade and open immigration. They tend to favor less government intervention in the domestic economy but more government intervention in international trade.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Reason-Rupe poll found that among those who self-identified as Tea Party supporters, 41 percent leaned libertarian and 59 percent socially conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Ekins, [http://reason.com/poll/2011/09/26/is-half-the-tea-part-libertart ''Is Half the Tea Party Libertarian?''], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]], 26 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement, named after the [[Boston Tea Party]], also contains conservative&lt;ref name=Conservatism&gt;{{cite news|author=Pauline Arrillaga|title=Tea Party 2012: A Look At The Conservative Movement's Last Three Years|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/14/tea-party-2012_n_1425957.html?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417025313/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/14/tea-party-2012_n_1425957.html|archivedate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=14 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|author=Michelle Boorstein|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/05/AR2010100501491.html|title=Tea party, religious right often overlap, poll shows|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Wallsten, Danny Yadron|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703882404575520252928390046|title=Tea-Party Movement Gathers Strength|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and populist elements&lt;ref name=populist&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123137382|first=Liz|last=Halloran|title=What's Behind The New Populism?|publisher=NPR|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/us/politics/16teaparty.html|title=Tea Party Lights Fuse for Rebellion on Right|work=The New York Times|date=16 February 2010 |first=David|last=Barstow}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/05/party-time.html|title=Party Time|work=Newsweek|date=6 April 2010|first=Howard|last=Fineman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sponsored multiple protests and supported various political candidates since 2009.

== Contemporary libertarian organizations ==
{{Category see also|Libertarian parties|Libertarian publications|Libertarian think tanks}}
Since the 1950s, many American libertarian organizations have adopted a free market stance, as well as supporting civil liberties and non-interventionist foreign policies. These include the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], [[Francisco Marroquín University]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], [[Center for Libertarian Studies]], the [[Cato Institute]] and [[Liberty International (organization)|Liberty International]]. The activist [[Free State Project]], formed in 2001, works to bring 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to influence state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html|first=Pam|last=Belluck|publisher=The New York Times|date=27 October 2003|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active student organizations include [[Students for Liberty]] and [[Young Americans for Liberty]].

A number of countries have libertarian parties that run candidates for political office. In the United States, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] was formed in 1972 and is the third largest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Hovde|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hovde/index.ssf/2009/05/americans_mixed_on_obamas_big.html|title=Americans mixed on Obama's big government gamble|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gairdner|first=William D.|title=The Trouble with Canada: A Citizen Speaks Out|publisher=BPS Books|location=Toronto|year=2007|origyear=1990|isbn=978-0-9784402-2-0|pages=101–102|quote=The first, we would call "libertarianism" today.

Current international anarchist federations which sometimes identify themselves as libertarian include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]]. The largest organized anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International: SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]] in Sweden; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] in Italy; [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] in the United States; and [[Solidarity Federation]] in the United Kingdom. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] claiming 2,000 paying members as well as the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]], also remain active. In the United States, there exists the [[Common Struggle|Common Struggle – Libertarian Communist Federation]].

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of libertarianism}}
[[Criticism of libertarianism]] includes ethical, economic, environmental, pragmatic, and philosophical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;This includes the view that mainstream libertarianism has no explicit theory of liberty. See for instance [https://philpapers.org/rec/INDNLA "New-Paradigm Libertarianism: a Very Brief Explanation"].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that ''laissez-faire'' capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://evonomics.com/complexity-economics-shows-us-that-laissez-faire-fail-nickhanauer/ "Complexity Economics Shows Us Why Laissez-Faire Economics Always Fails"].&lt;/ref&gt; nor does its philosophy of individualism and policies of deregulation prevent the abuse of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640625|title=Peak Oil : apocalyptic environmentalism and libertarian political culture|last=Matthew,|first=Schneider-Mayerson,|isbn=9780226285573|location=Chicago|oclc=922640625}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Authenticity of libertarian goals ===
Critics such as [[Corey Robin]] describe right-libertarianism as fundamentally a [[reactionary]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] ideology, united with more traditional conservative thought and goals by a desire to enforce hierarchical power and social relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin|last=Robin|first=Corey|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0199793743|location=|pages=15–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism, then, is not a commitment to limited government and liberty—or a wariness of change, a belief in evolutionary reform, or a politics of virtue. These may be the byproducts of conservatism, one or more of its historically specific and ever-changing modes of expression. But they are not its animating purpose. Neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of capitalists, Christians, and warriors, for that fusion is impelled by a more elemental force—the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors, particularly in the private sphere. Such a view might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market, with its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual. But it is not. When the libertarian looks out upon society, he does not see isolated individuals; he sees private, often hierarchical, groups, where a father governs his family and an owner his employees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Government decentralization ===
{{further|Decentralization}}
John Donahue argues that if political power were radically shifted to local authorities, parochial local interests would predominate at the expense of the whole and that this would exacerbate current problems with collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, John. (1 May 1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070414205533/http://www.prospect.org/print/V8/32/donahue-j.html "The Devil in Devolution"]. ''American Prospect''.  8 (32).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of real-world examples of libertarianism ===
[[Michael Lind]] has observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none have fully actualized a libertarian society: {{quote|If libertarianism was a good idea, wouldn't at least one country have tried it?  Wouldn't there be at least one country, out of nearly two hundred, with minimal government, free trade, open borders, decriminalized drugs, no welfare state and no public education system?&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lind|Lind, Michael]].  (4 June 2013.). [http://www.salon.com/2013/06/04/the_question_libertarians_just_cant_answer "The Question Libertarians Just Can't Answer"]. ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]].''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lind has also criticized libertarianism, particularly the right-wing and free market variant of the ideology, as being incompatible with [[democracy]] and apologetic towards [[autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/lind_libertariansim/|title=Why libertarians apologize for autocracy|first=Michael|last=Lind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, libertarian Warren Redlich argues that the United States "was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://independentpoliticalreport.com/2017/04/was-america-ever-libertarian/|title=Was America Ever Libertarian?|date=2017-04-25|work=Independent Political Report|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Larry Wu-Tai Chin==
Larry Wu-Tai Chin worked in the U.S. intelligence community for nearly 35 years while providing China with classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiades, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Chin was recruited as a spy by a Chinese Communist official in 1948; an interpreter at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai,&lt;ref name=gs&gt;Global Security.

==Wen Ho Lee ==
[[Wen Ho Lee]] is a Taiwanese-American scientist who worked for the University of California at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He created simulations of nuclear explosions for the purpose of scientific inquiry and to improve the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In December 1999, a federal grand jury indicted him of stealing secrets about the arsenal for China.

After federal investigators could not prove the initial accusations, the government conducted a separate investigation. It could only charge Lee with improper handling of restricted data, part of the original 59-count indictment to which he pleaded guilty as part of a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]]. In June 2006, Lee received $1.6&amp;nbsp;million from the federal government and five media organizations as partial settlement of a civil suit he filed against them for leaking his name to the press before charges were filed against him. At the conclusion of the case, Presiding federal judge James A. Parker stated that he was misled "by the executive branch of our government through its Department of Justice, by its Federal Bureau of Investigation and by its United States attorney". The judge stated that while he couldn't speak on behalf of the executive branch "I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner you were held in custody by the executive branch." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/14/us/statement-by-judge-in-los-alamos-case-with-apology-for-abuse-of-power.html/ |title= Statement by Judge in Los Alamos Case, With Apology for Abuse of Power|publisher=The New York Times |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fei Ye and Ming Zhong==
Fei Ye, a U.S. citizen; and Ming Zhong, a permanent resident of the United States; were arrested at the San Francisco International Airport on November 23, 2001. They were accused of stealing trade secrets in designing a computer microprocessor to benefit China, although prosecutors did not allege that the Chinese government knew of their activities. In December 2002, they were charged with a total of ten counts, including conspiracy; economic espionage; possession of stolen trade secrets; and foreign transportation of stolen property. In 2006 (five years after their arrest), they pleaded guilty to two counts each of economic espionage. In 2008, they were sentenced to a year in prison. The maximum sentence is 30 years however prosecutors asked for less because of their cooperation. The case resulted in the first convictions under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |title=Two Men Plead Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets from Silicon Valley Companies to Benefit China |publisher=justice.gov |date=2016-12-14 |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415113905/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cnet.com/news/2-engineers-sentenced-for-espionage/ |title= 2 engineers sentenced for espionage|publisher=cnet.com |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a month long trial, a federal jury acquitted the two defendants on two counts and were leaning towards acquitting the two by a vote of 9:3 on two most serious counts of economic espionage. Jurors said the U.S. government failed to prove the NetLogic data was even a trade secret and much less aimed to benefit China. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/11/20/federal-jury-deadlocks-on-most-of-espionage-case-against-two-silicon-valley-engineers/ |title= Federal jury deadlocks on most of espionage case against two Silicon Valley engineers|publisher=mercurynews.com |date=2009-11-20|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candace Marie Claiborne==
On March 28, 2017, The F.B.I. arrested a veteran State Department employee who concealed her extensive contacts with Chinese intelligence agents, who for years lavished her with thousands of dollars in gifts. Candace Marie Claiborne, 60, of Washington, was charged with felony obstruction and lying to the F.B.I. after her ties to the Chinese were uncovered, the authorities said. Prosecutors did not disclose where or when the Chinese first approached Ms. Claiborne, but did reveal she had once served in Beijing and Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/state-department-worker-is-accused-of-hiding-ties-to-china.html&lt;/ref&gt;  “Candace Marie Claiborne is a U.S. State Department employee who possesses a Top Secret security clearance and allegedly failed to report her contacts with Chinese foreign intelligence agents who provided her with thousands of dollars of gifts and benefits,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. “Claiborne used her position and her access to sensitive diplomatic data for personal profit. Pursuing those who imperil our national security for personal gain will remain a key priority of the National Security Division.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/state-department-employee-arrested-and-charged-concealing-extensive-contacts-foreign-agents&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years after his departure from the CIA, China began capturing and killing U.S. informants. Officials in the U.S. began investigating whether a mole was responsible for outing the identities of sources working with the U.S.  In May 2018, Lee was formally charged with conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/former-cia-agent-charged-destroying-us-spy-networks-china-921603&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the indictment, he met two intelligence officers from China’s Ministry of State Security in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong, in April 2010, and they gave him “a gift of $100,000 cash in exchange for his cooperation”, with the promise that “they would take care of him for life”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Lee received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that he deposited into his HSBC bank accounts in Hong Kong between 2010 and 2013,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the same time the CIA lost 18 to 20 Chinese informants who were killed on imprisoned for providing sensitive information to the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Lee started working for a cigarette company in Hong Kong in 2007, the same year he left the CIA.

This '''list of wars by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by war. These numbers usually include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of battle or other military wartime actions, as well as the wartime/war-related deaths of soldiers, which are the results of war-induced epidemics, famines, atrocities, genocide, etc.

McPherson, "Battle Cry of Freedom", Oxford University Press, Oct 24, 2003, page 619.

[http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/black-white-demographic-death-toll-civil-war/ "Color blindness in the demographic death toll of the Civil War".] Oxford University Press, April 13th 2012. "An 2 April 2012 New York Times article, "New Estimate Raises Civil War Death Toll," reports that a new study ratchets up the death toll from an estimated 650,000 to a staggering 850,000 people. As horrific as this new number is, it fails to reflect the mortality of former slaves during the war. If former slaves were included in this figure, the Civil War death toll would likely be over a million casualties... the rough 19th century estimate was that 60,000 former slaves died from [war-related diseases and starvation], but doctors treating black patients often claimed that they were unable to keep accurate records due to demands on their time and the lack of manpower and resources... tens of thousands of other slaves who died had no contact with army doctors, leaving no records of their deaths".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades that followed, the use of the term "neoliberal" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more ''laissez-faire'' doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a [[market economy]] under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the [[social market economy]].

In the 1960s, usage of the term "neoliberal" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Economic history of Chile#"Neoliberal" reforms (1973–90)|economic reforms]] in [[Chile]], the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism|capitalist]] set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of [[Mont Pelerin Society]] economists [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], along with politicians and policy-makers such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Alan Greenspan]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Springer|editor1-first= Simon |editor2-last= Birch|editor2-first= Kean |editor3-last= MacLeavy|editor3-first= Julie|date= 2016 |title= The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Handbook-of-Neoliberalism/Springer-Birch-MacLeavy/p/book/9781138844001|location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3] |isbn= 978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; By 1994, with the passage of [[NAFTA]] and with the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' reaction to this development in [[Chiapas]], the term entered global circulation.&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="Handbookscholarship"/&gt;

==Terminology==

===Origins===
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
An early use of the term in English was in 1898 by the French economist [[Charles Gide]] to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist [[Maffeo Pantaleoni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gide|first=Charles|date=1898-01-01|title=Has Co-operation Introduced a New Principle into Economics?|jstor=2957091|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=8|issue=32|pages=490–511|doi=10.2307/2957091}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term "néo-libéralisme" previously existing in French,&lt;ref name="OxfordNeoliberalism"/&gt; and the term was later used by others including the classical liberal economist [[Milton Friedman]] in a 1951 essay.&lt;ref name="Burgin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Burgin|title=The Great Persuasion: Reinventing Free Markets since the Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnZ1qKdXojoC&amp;pg=PA170|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06743-1|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 at the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]], the term "neoliberalism" was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving "the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state".&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} To be "neoliberal" meant advocating a modern economic policy with [[state intervention]].&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing ''laissez-faire'' camp of classical liberals, like [[Ludwig von Mises]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Guido Hülsmann]], [https://mises.org/daily/6022/ Against the Neoliberals], Ludwig von Mises Institute, May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Eucken, Röpke, Rüstow and Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neoliberalism: From New Liberal Philosophy to Anti-Liberal Slogan |author=Taylor C. Boas, Jordan Gans-Morse |journal=Studies in Comparative International Development |date=June 2009 |volume=44 |issue=2 |page=147 |doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military rule under Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression to describe the [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973–1990)|economic reforms implemented there]] and its proponents (the "[[Chicago Boys]]").&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Once this new meaning was established among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to one study of 148 scholarly articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has largely become a term of condemnation employed by critics and suggests a [[market fundamentalism]] closer to the ''laissez-faire'' principles of the paleoliberals{{who|date=October 2016}} than to the ideas of those who originally attended the colloquium. This leaves some controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the [[social science]]s, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

Another center-left movement from [[modern American liberalism]] that used the term "neoliberalism" to describe its ideology formed in the United States in the 1970s. According to David Brooks, prominent neoliberal politicians included Al Gore and Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/opinion/11brooks.html?_r=0 The Vanishing Neoliberal], The New York Times, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and the ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/04/chait-neoliberal-new-inquiry-democrats-socialism/|title=The First Neoliberals|last= Robin|first=Corey|date= April 28, 2016|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|publisher= |access-date= April 23, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "godfather" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist [[Charles Peters]],&lt;ref&gt;Matt Welch, [http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/25/the-death-of-contrarianism The Death of Contrarianism.

===Current usage===
Elizabeth Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left-leaning academics in the 1970s "to describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, "Review," ''Journal of Modern History''  (Dec 2014) 86#4 pp. 884–90&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberal theory argues that a free market will allow efficiency, economic growth, income distribution, and technological progress to occur. Any state intervention to encourage these phenomena will worsen economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism|last=Kotz|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the handbook argues to view the term as merely a pejorative or "radical political slogan" is to "reduce its capacity as an analytic frame. If neoliberalism is to serve as a way of understanding the transformation of society over the last few decades then the concept is in need of unpacking".&lt;ref name="Handbook2"/&gt; Currently, neoliberalism is most commonly used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating [[price control]]s, [[deregulation|deregulating]] capital markets, lowering trade barriers" and reducing state influence on the economy, especially through [[privatization]] and [[austerity]].&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; Other scholars note that neoliberalism is associated with the economic policies introduced by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States.&lt;ref name = "For Business Ethics"/&gt;

There are several distinct usages of the term that can be identified:
* As a [[development model]], it refers to the rejection of [[structuralist economics]] in favor of the Washington Consensus.
* As an [[ideology]], it denotes a conception of freedom as an overarching [[Value (ethics)|social value]] associated with reducing state functions to those of a [[minimal state]].

Sociologists [[Fred L. Block]] and Margaret R. Somers claim there is a dispute over what to call the influence of free market ideas which have been used to justify the retrenchment of [[New Deal]] programs and policies over the last thirty years: neoliberalism, ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or "free market ideology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred L. Block]] and Margaret R.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought about high unemployment and widespread poverty and was widely regarded as a failure of [[economic liberalism]]. To renew liberalism, a group of 25 intellectuals organised the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann Colloquium]] at Paris in August 1938. It brought together [[Louis Rougier]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]] and [[Alexander Rüstow]] among others. Most agreed that the liberalism of ''laissez-faire'' had failed and that a new liberalism needed to take its place with a major role for the state. Mises and Hayek refused to condemn ''laissez-faire'', but all participants were united in their call for a new project they dubbed "neoliberalism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} They agreed to develop the Colloquium into a permanent think tank called Centre International d’Études pour la Rénovation du Libéralisme based in Paris.

Deep disagreements in the group separated "true (third way) neoliberals" around Rüstow and Lippmann on the one hand and old school liberals around Mises and Hayek on the other. The first group wanted a strong state to supervise, while the second insisted that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Rüstow wrote that Hayek and Mises were relics of the liberalism that caused the Great Depression. Mises denounced the other faction, complaining that [[ordoliberalism]] really meant "ordo-interventionism".&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

===Mont Pelerin Society===
Neoliberalism began accelerating in importance with the establishment of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] in 1947, whose founding members included [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Karl Popper]], [[George Stigler]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The Colloque Walter Lippmann was largely forgotten.&lt;ref name="JACKSON p=129"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal | last=Jackson | first=Ben | title=At the Origins of Neo-Liberalism: The Free Economy and the Strong State, 1930–1947 | journal=The Historical Journal | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=53 | issue=1 | date=2010-01-29 | issn=0018-246X | doi=10.1017/s0018246x09990392 |subscription=yes | pages=129–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new society brought together the widely scattered free market thinkers and political figures.

{{quote|Hayek and others believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws and that the only way to diagnose and rectify them was to withdraw into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16}}}}

With [[central planning]] in the ascendancy worldwide and few avenues to influence policymakers, the society served to bring together isolated advocates of liberalism as a "rallying point" – as Milton Friedman phrased it. Meeting annually, it would soon be a "kind of international 'who's who' of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals."&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Nash]], ''The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945'', Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1976, {{ISBN|978-1-882926-12-1}}, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the epicenter of the community with Europeans dominating the leadership.&lt;ref name="mirowski"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

==Post-World War II neo-liberal currents==

===Argentina===
{{further|José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|Domingo Cavallo}}
In the 1960s, [[Latin America]]n intellectuals began to notice the ideas of [[ordoliberalism]]; these intellectuals often used the Spanish term "neoliberalismo" to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly impressed by the social market economy and the Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle") in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Neoliberalism in 1960s meant essentially a philosophy that was more moderate than classical liberalism and favored using state policy to temper [[social inequality]] and counter a tendency toward monopoly.&lt;ref name="Boas2009" /&gt;

In 1976, the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]'s economic plan led by Martínez de Hoz was the first attempt at a neoliberalist plan in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal austerity plan, whose goal was to reduce money printing and thus inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen, but they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. Aiming for a free market, they also decided to open the country's borders, so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina's industry, which had been on the rise for the last 20 years since Frondizi's economic plan, rapidly declined, because it wasn't able to compete with foreign goods. Finally, the deregulation of the financial sector, gave a short-term growth, but then rapidly fell apart when capital fled to the United States in the Reagan years.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1989 to 2001, another neoliberalist plan was attempted by Domingo Cavallo. This time, the privatization of public services was the main objective of the government; although financial deregulation and open borders to foreign goods were also re-implemented. While some privatizations were welcomed, the majority of them were criticized for not being in the people's best interests. Along with an increased [[labour market flexibility]], the final result of this plan was an unemployment rate of 25% and 60% of people living under the poverty line, alongside 33 people killed by the police in protests that ended up with the president, Fernando de la Rúa, resigning two years before his term as president was completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Australia===
In Australia, neoliberal economic policies (known at the time as "economic rationalism"&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, M., 2003. Economic rationalism in Canberra: A nation-building state changes its mind. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "economic fundamentalism") were embraced by governments of both the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] since the 1980s. The Labor governments of [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] from 1983-96 pursued economic liberalisation and a program of micro-economic reform. These governments privatised government corporations, deregulated factor markets, floated the [[Australian dollar]] and reduced trade protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803004406/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html |date=2012-08-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating, as federal treasurer, implemented a compulsory [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation guarantee]] system in 1992 to increase national savings and reduce future government liability for old age pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson L and Harris B ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/BN/2008-09/Chron_Superannuation.htm Chronology of superannuation and retirement income in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909175528/http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/BN/2008-09/Chron_Superannuation.htm |date=2011-09-09 }} Parliamentary Library, Canberra, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The financing of universities was deregulated, requiring students to contribute to [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|university fees]] through a repayable loan system known as the [[Higher Education Contribution Scheme]] (HECS) and encouraging universities to increase income by admitting full-fee-paying students, including foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Marginson S [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3310 Tertiary Education: A revolution to what end?]'' Online Opinion, 5 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of domestic fee-paying students to public universities was abolished in 2009 by the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Labor government]].&lt;ref name="Ministers Media Centre, Australian Government 2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Government Delivers on Promise to Phase Out Full Fee Degrees |website=Ministers' Media Centre, Australian Government |date=2008-10-29 |url=https://ministers.jobs.gov.au/gillard/government-delivers-promise-phase-out-full-fee-degrees |access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to the mainland capitals by refugees had seen capital flows follow soon after, such as from war-torn [[Lebanon]] and [[Vietnam]]. Latter economic-migrants from mainland [[China]] also, up to recent restrictions, had invested significantly in the property markets.

In 1955, a select group of Chilean students (later known as the [[Chicago Boys]]) were invited to the [[University of Chicago]] to pursue postgraduate studies in economics. They worked directly under Friedman and his disciple, [[Arnold Harberger]], while also being exposed to Hayek. When they returned to Chile in the 1960s, they began a concerted effort to spread the philosophy and policy recommendations of the Chicago and Austrian schools, setting up think tanks and publishing in ideologically sympathetic media. Under the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship headed by Pinochet]] and severe social repression, the Chicago boys implemented [[Economic history of Chile (1973-1990)#“Neoliberal” reforms (1973-1990)|radical economic reform]]. The latter half of the 1970s witnessed rapid and extensive privatization, deregulation and reductions in trade barriers. In 1978, policies that would reduce the role of the state and infuse competition and individualism into areas such as labor relations, pensions, health and education were introduced.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; These policies resulted in widening inequality as they negatively impacted the wages, benefits and working conditions of Chile's working class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Peter Winn]] (ed), ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/Victims-of-the-Chilean-Miracle/ Victims of the Chilean Miracle: Workers and Neoliberalism in the Pinochet Era, 1973–2002]'', ([[Duke University Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|082233321X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Constable and Arturo Valenzuela, ''A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet,'' ([[W. W.

Retrieved December 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Naomi Klein|Klien]], by the late 1980s the economy had stabilized and was growing, but around 45% of the population had fallen into poverty while the wealthiest 10% saw their incomes rise by 83%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2008).

In 1990, the military dictatorship ended. Hayek argued that increased economic freedom had put pressure on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. Years earlier, he argued that "economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean scholars Martínez and Díaz rejected this argument, pointing to the long tradition of democracy in Chile. The return of democracy required the defeat of the Pinochet regime, though it had been fundamental in saving capitalism. The essential contribution came from profound mass rebellions and finally, old party elites using old institutional mechanisms to bring back democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Martínez, Alvaro Díaz, The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8157-5478-7}}, pp. 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The European Union (EU) is sometimes considered as a neoliberal organization as it facilitates free trade and freedom of movement. It erodes national protectionism and it limits national subsidies.&lt;ref name="SPERI 2017"&gt;{{cite web |first=Keshia |last=Jacotine|title=The split in neoliberalism on Brexit and the EU |website=SPERI |date=2017-06-22 |url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2017/06/22/the-split-in-neoliberalism-on-brexit-and-the-eu/ |access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others underline that the EU is not completely neoliberal as it leaves the possibility to develop welfare state policies.&lt;ref name="Milward 2000 p.

===Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F015320-0010, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludwig Erhard]]]]
Neoliberal ideas were first implemented in [[West Germany]]. The economists around [[Ludwig Erhard]] drew on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contributed to West Germany's reconstruction after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Marc Hartwich]], [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/68/neoliberalism68.pdf Neoliberalism: The Genesis of a Political Swearword], Centre for Independent Studies, 2009, {{ISBN|1-86432-185-7}}, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepted this classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Erhard, [http://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/le64a.htm Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund], In: Ludwig Erhard, Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, hrsg. v. Karl Hohmann, Düsseldorf u. a. 1988, S. 861, Rede zu Oppenheimers 100. Geburtstag, gehalten in der Freien Universität Berlin (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] was more pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive [[welfare state]], German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place [[Humanistic capitalism|humanistic]] and social values on par with economic efficiency. [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] coined the phrase "social market economy" to emphasize the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and humanistic bent of the idea.&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt; According to Boas and Gans-Morse, [[Walter Eucken]] stated that "social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time".&lt;ref name=Boas2009/&gt;

[[File:Marshallplanhilfe.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Builders in [[West Berlin]], 1952]]
Erhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt; He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of ''Volkskapitalismus'', there were some efforts to foster private savings. However, although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a "reluctant expansion of the welfare state". To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under [[Otto von Bismarck]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Abelshauser, Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945, C.H.Beck, 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-406-510946}}, Seite 192&lt;/ref&gt; Rüstow, who had coined the label "neoliberalism", criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare program.&lt;ref name="Hartwich"/&gt;

Hayek did not like the expression "social market economy", but stated in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using that phrase. However, in Hayek's view the social market economy's aiming for both a market economy and [[social justice]] was a muddle of inconsistent aims.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Drexl, ''Die wirtschaftliche Selbstbestimmung des Verbrauchers'', J.C.B. Mohr, 1998, {{ISBN|3-16-146938-0}}, Abschnitt: Freiheitssicherung auch gegen den Sozialstaat, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his controversies with the German neoliberals at the Mont Pelerin Society, [[Ludwig von Mises]] stated that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this "a lesson for the US".&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Ptak, Vom Ordoliberalismus zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Stationen des Neoliberalismus in Deutschland, 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to different research Mises believed that the ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwig's complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the ordoliberals, Mises wrote: "I have no illusions about the true character of the politics and politicians of the social market economy". According to Mises, Erhard's teacher [[Franz Oppenheimer]] "taught more or less the [[New Frontier]] line of" [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy's]] "Harvard consultants ([[Arthur M. Schlesinger|Schlesinger]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Guido Jorg Hulsmann, Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, {{ISBN|978-1933550183}}, pp. 1007–08&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, neoliberalism at first was synonymous with both ordoliberalism and social market economy. But over time the original term neoliberalism gradually disappeared since social market economy was a much more positive term and fit better into the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) mentality of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hartwich" /&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
{{See also|Rogernomics}}
In New Zealand, neoliberal economic policies were implemented under the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] led by Prime Minister [[David Lange]]. These neoliberal policies are commonly referred to as [[Rogernomics]], a portmanteau of “Roger” and “economics”,  after Lange appointed Roger Douglas minister of finance in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Life|last=Lange|first=David|publisher=Viking|year=2005|isbn=0-670-04556-X|location=|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange's government had inherited a severe balance of payments crisis as a result of the deficits from the previously implemented two-year freeze on wages and prices by preceding Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] who had also stubbornly maintained an unsustainable exchange rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Schools Compete: A Cautionary Tale|last=Fiske|first=Edward B.|last2=Ladd|first2=Helen F.|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8157-2835-2|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherited economic conditions lead Lange to remark “We ended up being run very similarly to a Polish shipyard.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=David Lange, in his own words|last=|first=|date=15 August 2005|work=The New Zealand Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September 1984 Lange's government held an Economic Summit to discuss the underlying problems in the New Zealand economy, which lead to advocacy of radical economic reform previously proposed by the Treasury Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution: New Zealand from Fortress to Free Market|last=Russell|first=Marcia|publisher=Hodder Moa Beckett|year=1996|isbn=1869584287|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reform program consisting of deregulation and the removal of tariffs and subsidies was put in place which consequently affected [[New Zealand's agricultural community|New Zealand's agricultural community]], who were hit hard by the loss of subsidies to farmers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution: New Zealand from Fortress to Free Market|last=Russell|first=Marcia|publisher=Hodder Moa Becket|year=1996|isbn=1869584287|location=|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A superannuation surcharge was introduced, despite having promised not to reduce [[superannuation]], resulting in [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] losing support from the elderly. The finance markets were also deregulated, removing restrictions on interests rates, lending and foreign exchange and in March 1985, the New Zealand dollar was floated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/cartoon/33456/floating-the-new-zealand-dollar|title=Reserve Bank - Reverse Bank, 1936 to 1984|last=Singleton|first=John|date=20 June 2012|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a number of government departments were converted into state-owned enterprises which lead to great job loss: Electricity Corporation 3,000; Coal Corporation 4,000; Forestry Corporation 5,000; New Zealand Post 8,000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

New Zealand became a part of a global economy. The focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance as a result of zero restrictions on overseas money coming into the country. Finance capital outstripped industrial capital and subsequently, the manufacturing industry suffered approximately 76,000 job losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I See Red|last=Bell|first=Judith|publisher=Awa Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

===Austrian School===
{{Austrian School sidebar}}
The [[Austrian School]] is a school of economic thought which bases its study of economic phenomena on the interpretation and analysis of [[methodological individualism|the purposeful actions of individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Menger, Principles of Economics, online at https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=Methodological Individualism|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mises_Action"&gt;Ludwig von Mises. [[Human Action]], p. 11, "r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction". Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives its name from its origin in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of economic analysis, Oxford University Press 1996, {{ISBN|978-0195105599}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st century usage by such economists as [[Mark Skousen]], reference to the Austrian school often denotes a reference to the free-market economics of [[Friedrich Hayek]] who began his teaching in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skouzen. ''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the contributions of the Austrian School to economic theory are the [[subjective theory of value]], [[marginalism]] in price theory and the formulation of the [[economic calculation problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Birner | first1 = Jack| first2 = Rudy | last2 = van Zijp| title = Hayek, Co-ordination and Evolution: His Legacy in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and the History of Ideas| location = London, New York| publisher = [[Routledge]]|date=1994| page = 94| isbn = 978-0-415-09397-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theories developed by "first wave" Austrian economists have been absorbed into most [[Mainstream economics|mainstream]] schools of economics. These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on [[opportunity cost]] and Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's theories on time preference as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of [[Marxian economics]]. The Austrian School follows an approach, termed [[methodological individualism]], a version of which was codified by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and termed "[[praxeology]]" in his book published in English as ''[[Human Action]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Ludwigvon"&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1949] 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000 that "the Austrian School have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan.

===Chicago School===
{{Chicago school sidebar|expanded=movements}}
The [[Chicago school of economics]] describes a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of [[University of Chicago]]. Chicago [[macroeconomic]] theory rejected [[Keynesianism]] in favor of [[monetarism]] until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations.&lt;ref name=ElgarComp&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmet|first=Ross|title=The Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics|date=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-1840648744|page=133|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is strongly associated with economists such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref name=Mirowski&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirowski|first=Philip|title=The Road from Mont Pelerin: The Making of the Neoliberal Thought Collective|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674033183|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21 century, economists such as [[Mark Skousen]] refer to [[Friedrich Hayek]] as a key economist who influenced this school in the 20th century having started his career in Vienna and the Austrian school of economics.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skousen. ''Vienna and Chicago: Friends or Foes? A Tale of Two Schools of Free-Market Economics'', (Capital Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0895260298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient with the exception of central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. [[monetarism]]). Although the school's association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents,&lt;ref name="ElgarComp" /&gt; its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.&lt;ref name="FPIF-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biglaiser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biglaiser|first=Glen|title=The Internationalization of Chicago's Economics in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=January 2002|volume=50|issue=2|doi=10.1086/322875|pages=269–86|jstor=322875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political policy aspects==

===Political freedom===
In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek has argued: "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".&lt;ref name="Chicago Press 1944 p.95"/&gt;

[[File:Milton friedman y richard nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Richard Nixon]]]]
Later in his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman developed the argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression.

In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplifying Friedman's argument, it has often been pointed out that increasing economic freedoms tend to raise expectations on political freedoms, eventually leading to democracy. Other scholars see the existence of non-democratic yet market-liberal regimes and the undermining of democratic control by market processes as strong evidence that such a general, ahistorical nexus cannot be upheld.&lt;ref name="WBrown"/&gt; Contemporary discussion on the relationship between neoliberalism and democracy shifted to a more historical perspective, studying extent and circumstances of how much the two are mutually dependent, contradictory or incompatible.

[[Stanley Fish]] argues that neoliberalization of academic life may promote a narrower and in his opinion more accurate definition of [[academic freedom]] "as the freedom to do the academic job, not the freedom to expand it to the point where its goals are infinite". What Fish urges is "not an inability to take political stands, but a refraining from doing so in the name of academic responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/ Academic Freedom Against Itself] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228071627/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/stanley-fish/# |date=2018-02-28 }}, New York Times Opionator, 28 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Neoliberalism has received criticism both from the political left as well as the right,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Higher Degree Research By Numbers: Beyond the Critiques of Neo-liberalism|first1= Timothy |last1= Laurie |first2= Liam |last2= Grealy |journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development  |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |pages= 458–71 |year= 2017 |url=https://www.academia.edu/31833744/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to myriad activists and academics.&lt;ref name="Neoliberal Hegemony"&gt;{{cite book |last=Plehwe |first=Dieter |last2=Walpen |first2=Bernhard |last3=Neunhöffer |first3=Gisela |title=Neoliberal hegemony : a global critique |publication-place=London &amp; New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=9780203099506 |oclc=646744326 |chapter=Introduction: Reconsidering neoliberal hegemony |chapter-url={{Google books|kiaxAx5l1QEC|page=1|plainurl=yes}} |access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Marois and Lucia Pradella posit that the impact of the [[Great Recession|global 2008–2009 crisis]] has given rise to new scholarship that criticizes neoliberalism and seeks policy alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;

===Focus on economic efficiency===
Much of the literature in support of neoliberalism relies on the idea that neoliberal market logic improves a very narrow monetized conception of performance, which is not necessarily the best approach. This focus on economic efficiency can compromise other, perhaps more important factors. Anthropologist Mark Fleming argues that when the performance of a transit system is assessed purely in terms of economic efficiency, social goods such as strong workers' rights are considered impediments to maximum performance, which given the monetization of time means timely premium rapid networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=Mark|title=Mass Transit Workers and Neoliberal Time Discipline in San Francisco|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2016|volume=118|issue=4|pages=784–95|accessdate=|doi=10.1111/aman.12683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the case study of the San Francisco Muni, Fleming shows that neoliberal worldview has resulted in vicious attacks on the drivers' union, for example through the setting of impossible schedules so that drivers are necessarily late and through brutal public smear campaigns. This ultimately resulted in the passing of Proposition G, which severely undermined the powers of the Muni drivers' union. Workers' rights are by no means the only victims of the neoliberal focus on economic efficiency as it is important to recognize that this vision and metric of performance judgment de-emphasizes literally every public good that is not conventionally monetized. For example, the geographers Birch and Siemiatycki contend that the growth of marketization ideology has shifted discourse such that it focuses on monetary rather than social objectives, making it harder to justify public goods driven by equity, environmental concerns and social justice.&lt;ref name="Birch Siemiatycki pp. 177–198"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Birch |first=Kean |last2=Siemiatycki |first2=Matti |title=Neoliberalism and the geographies of marketization |journal=Progress in Human Geography |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=40 |issue=2 |date=2015-03-05 |issn=0309-1325 |doi=10.1177/0309132515570512 |pages=177–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described neoliberalism as a class project, designed to impose class on society through liberalism.&lt;ref name="DavidHarvey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkWWMOzNNrQ |title=A Brief History of Neoliberalism 1/5 |last=Harvey |first=David |author-link=David Harvey (geographer) |website=YouTube |series=A Brief History of Neoliberalism |access-date=2018-07-07}} Also see {{YouTube|playlist=PLA27CFAD836E1638A|title=David Harvey : A Brief History of Neoliberalism}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy posit that "the restoration and increase of the power, income, and wealth of the upper classes" are the primary objectives of the neoliberal agenda&lt;ref name="Duménil Lévy 2016 p. 551"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gérard |last=Duménil |authorlink=Gérard Duménil |first2=Dominique |last2=Lévy |authorlink2=Dominique Lévy |editor-last=Springer |editor-first=Simon |editor-last2=Birch |editor-first2=Kean |editor-last3=MacLeavy |editor-first3=Julie |title=The handbook of neoliberalism |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |publication-place=New York &amp; London |year=2016 |isbn=131754966X  |oclc=953604193 |chapter=The crisis of neoliberalism |chapter-url={{google books|id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ|page=PA551||plainurl=yes}} |pages=551–557 |access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist David M.

Sociologist Thomas Volscho argues that the imposition of neoliberalism in the United States arose from a conscious political mobilization by capitalist elites in the 1970s who faced two crises: the legitimacy of capitalism and a falling rate of profitability in industry. Various neoliberal ideologies (such as [[monetarism]] and [[supply-side economics]]) had been long advanced by elites, translated into policies by the Reagan administration and ultimately resulted in less governmental regulation and a shift from a tax-financed state to a debt-financed one. While the profitability of industry and the rate of economic growth never recovered to the heyday of the 1960s, the political and economic power of Wall Street and finance capital vastly increased due to the debt-financing of the state.&lt;ref name="Volscho pp. 249–266"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volscho |first=Thomas |title=The Revenge of the Capitalist Class: Crisis, the Legitimacy of Capitalism and the Restoration of Finance from the 1970s to Present |journal=Critical Sociology |publisher=SAGE Publications |volume=43 |issue=2 |date=2016-07-28 |issn=0896-9205 |ssrn=2602893 |id={{OCLC|7374542920|6962223812}} |doi=10.1177/0896920515589003 |pages=249–266}} SSRN Pre-publication is free access {{free access}}; SAGE Journals doi publication is closed access {{closed access}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In expanding upon Wacquant's thesis, sociologist and political economist John L. Campbell of [[Dartmouth College]] suggests that through [[Private prison|privatization]], the prison system exemplifies the centaur state: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand, it punishes the lower class, which populates the prisons; on the other hand, it profits the upper class, which owns the prisons, and it employs the middle class, which runs them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, he says the prison system benefits corporations through outsourcing as the inmates are "slowly becoming a source of low-wage labor for some US corporations". Both through privatization and outsourcing, Campbell argues, the penal state reflects neoliberalism.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Neoliberalism's penal and debtor states |author=[http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/john-l-campbell John L.

===Global health===
The effect of neoliberalism on global health, particularly the aspect of international aid, involves key players such as [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. According to James Pfeiffer,&lt;ref name="Pfieffer UW faculty page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/james-pfeiffer|title=James Pfeiffer |publisher=University of Washington - Department of Global Health|website=globalhealth.washington.edu|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; neoliberal emphasis has been placed on free markets and privatization which has been tied to the "new policy agenda" in which NGOs are seen as being able to provide better social welfare than governments. International NGOs have been promoted to fill holes in public services created by the World Bank and IMF through their promotion of [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) which reduce government health spending and which Pfeiffer criticized as unsustainable. The reduced health spending and the gain of the public health sector by NGOs causes the local health system to become fragmented, undermines local control of health programs and contributes to local social inequality between NGO workers and local individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Pfeiffer |first1 = J |year = 2003 |title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration |doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0 |journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume = 56 |issue = 4 |pages =  725–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers for the IMF released a paper entitled "Neoliberalism: Oversold?", which stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is much to cheer in the neoliberal agenda. The expansion of global trade has rescued millions from abject poverty. Foreign direct investment has often been a way to transfer technology and know-how to developing economies. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has in many instances led to more efficient provision of services and lowered the fiscal burden on governments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it was also critical of some neoliberal policies, such as freedom of capital and fiscal consolidation for "increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]], in turn jeopardizing durable expansion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/pdf/ostry.pdf Neoliberalism: Oversold?] – IMF Finance &amp; Development June 2016 • Volume 53 • Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also note that some neoliberal policies are to blame for financial crises around the world growing bigger and more damaging.&lt;ref name="secondthoughts"&gt;[http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/?xid=newsletter-brief Globalization’s True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].'' June 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The report contends the implementation of neoliberal policies by economic and political elites has led to "three disquieting conclusions":
* The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.
* The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.
* Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-neoliberalism-warnings-2016-5 IMF: The last generation of economic policies may have been a complete failure].

The policies of spending cuts coupled with tax increases give "real market reform a bad name and set back the cause of genuine liberalism". Paternalistic supranational bureaucrats foster "long-term dependency, perpetual indebtedness, moral hazard, and politicization, while discrediting market reform and forestalling revolutionary liberal change".&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Richman, ''End the IMF: What Is It Good For?'', ''The Freeman'', May 20, 2011, retrieved February 29, 2012, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110523095258/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/tgif/end-imf/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowden wrote that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritising price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure, resulting in chronically underfunded public health systems, demoralising working conditions that have fueled a "[[brain drain]]" of medical personnel and the undermining of public health and the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]] in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS|last=Rowden|first=Rick|publisher=Zed Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1848132856|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the rise of neoliberalism eroded the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower-era Republican centrism]] that had resulted in the massive allocation of public capital to large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in both [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]: "In the pre-Reagan era, infrastructure was an apolitical, positively connoted, technocratic term shared by mainstream economists and policy makers […] including President Eisenhower, a praetorian Republican leader who had championed investment in the Interstate Highway System, America’s national road grid […] But Reagan, Thatcher, Delors and their many admirers amongst Clintonian, ‘[[New Labour]]’ and EU Social-Democrat decision makers in Brussels sought to dismantle the generous state subsidies for social infrastructure and public transportation across the United States, Britain and the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas J. Firzli, [https://www.academia.edu/26978017/After_The_Neoliberals_A_New_Middle_Way_for_Britain_and_America_Rescuing_Native_Workers_and_Jumpstarting_the_Economy/ The End of 'Globalization’?

Following [[Brexit]], the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] and the progressive emergence of a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" ("[[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]]") moving away to some extent from the neoliberal orthodoxies of the past, we may witness a "massive increase in infrastructure investment" in the United States, Britain and other advanced economies:&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman : [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Economic Policy in the Post-Neocon Age', Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2016 – Issue N°60]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;With the victory of [[Donald J. Trump]] on November 8, 2016, the 'neoliberal-neoconservative' policy consensus that had crystalized in 1979–1980 (Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States, election of Reagan and Thatcher) finally came to an end [...] The deliberate neglect of America's creaking infrastructure assets (notably public transportation and water sanitation) from the early 1980s on eventually fueled a widespread popular discontent that came back to haunt both [[Hillary Clinton]] and the Republican establishment. Donald Trump was quick to seize on the issue to make a broader slap against the ''laissez-faire'' complacency of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nicolas J.

Others such as Catherine Rottenberg do not see Trump's victory as an end to neoliberalism, but rather a new phase of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/12/trumping-neoliberalism-steroids-161215144834626.html|title=Trumping it up: Neoliberalism on steroids|last= Rottenberg|first=Catherine|date=December 18, 2016 |website=Al Jazeera|publisher= |access-date= April 20, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporatocracy===
{{main|Corporatocracy}}
Mark Arthur has written that the influence of neoliberalism has given rise to an "[[anti-corporatists|anti-corporatist]]" movement in opposition to it. This "anti-corporatist" movement is articulated around the need to re-claim the power that corporations and global institutions have stripped governments of. He says that [[Adam Smith]]'s "rules for mindful markets" served as a basis for the anti-corporate movement, "following government's failure to restrain corporations from hurting or disturbing the happiness of the neighbor [Smith]".&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and the Prospects for World Government.

===Environmental impact===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Nicolas Firzli has argued that the neoliberal era was essentially defined by "the economic ideas of Milton Friedman, who wrote that 'if anything is certain to destroy our free society, to undermine its very foundation, it would be a widespread acceptance by management of social responsibilities in some sense other than to make as much money as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine'".&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

* Even if it could be shown that neoliberal capitalism increases productivity, it erodes the conditions in which production occurs long term, i.e. resources/nature, requiring expansion into new areas. It is therefore not sustainable within the world's limited geographical space.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. (2011) 'Transcending the metabolic rift: a theory of crises in the capitalist worldecology', Journal of Peasant Studies, 38: 1, 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social and ecological damages: heterodox economists argue that neoliberalism is a system that socializes costs and privatizes profits. It is thus a system of unpaid costs and avoidance of responsibility. The main solution are seen in social controls of the economy to prevent damages, namely the precautionary principle and the reversal of the burden of proof. This markedly differs from neoclassical and neoliberal solutions that propose taxes, bargaining, or judicial process.&lt;ref name="Berger 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Sebastian |title=The social costs of neoliberalism : essays on the economics of K.

According to the economists Howell and Diallo, neoliberal policies have contributed to a United States economy in which 30% of workers earn low wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers) and 35% of the labor force is underemployed as only 40% of the working-age population in the country is adequately employed.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, David R. and Mamadou Diallo. 2007.

The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR) Dean Baker (2006) argued that the driving force behind rising inequality in the United States has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including anti-inflationary bias, anti-[[Trade union|unionism]] and profiteering in the health industry.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. 2006. "Increasing Inequality in the United States.[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue40/Baker40.pdf]" Post-autistic Economics Review 40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, countries have applied neoliberal policies at varying levels of intensity—for example, the [[OECD]] has calculated that only 6% of Swedish workers are beset with wages it considers low and that Swedish wages are overall lower.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2007. "[http://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/38749309.pdf OECD Employment Outlook.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], asserts that the [[Triumphalism|triumphalist]] attitudes of Western powers at the end of the [[Cold War]] and the fixation with linking all leftist political ideals with the excesses of [[Stalinism]], permitted neoliberal, free market capitalism to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment and rising inequality throughout the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and much of the West in the following decades that has fueled the resurgence of extremist [[nationalism]]s in both the former and the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=xix–xx, 134, 197–99 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

Ruth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the [[University of Sheffield]], accuses the United States and its allies of fomenting [[state terrorism]] and mass killings during the Cold War as a means to buttress and promote the expansion of capitalism and neoliberalism in the developing world.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}

[[Ayn Rand]]'s philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] has been and continues to be a major influence on the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement, particularly in the United States. Many libertarians justify their political views using aspects of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''For the New Intellectual'' (1961) Random House; see also, Peikoff, Leonard, ''Objectivisim: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand'' (1991) Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the views of Rand and her philosophy among prominent libertarians are mixed and many Objectivists are hostile to libertarians in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Peter |title=On Moral Sanctions |journal=The Intellectual Activist |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=May 18, 1989 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_sanctions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical disagreements ==

===Aggression===
Some libertarians, including [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Walter Block]], hold the view that the [[non-aggression principle]] is an irreducible concept: it is not the logical result of any given ethical philosophy but, rather, is self-evident as any other axiom is.  Rand, too, argued that liberty was a precondition of virtuous conduct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=From My 'Future File' |journal=The Ayn Rand Letter |volume=3 |issue=26 |date=September 23, 1974 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that her non-aggression principle itself derived from a complex set of previous knowledge and values.  For this reason, Objectivists refer to the non-aggression principle as such, while libertarians who agree with Rothbard's argument call it "the non-aggression [[axiom]]."

Rothbard and other [[anarcho-capitalists]] hold that government requires non-voluntary taxation to function and that in all known historical cases, the state was established by force rather than [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/easaran/chap3.asp |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Anatomy of the State: What the State Is Not |work=Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus consider the establishment and maintenance of the [[night-watchman state]] supported by Objectivists to be in violation of the non-aggression principle. On the other hand, Rand believed that government can in principle be funded through voluntary means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/taxation.html|title=Taxation|author=|date=|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary financing notwithstanding, libertarians consider that a government would by definition still violate individual rights (commit aggression) by enforcing a monopoly over a given territory[https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/roy-a-childs-jr/objectivism-and-the-state-an-open-letter-to-ayn-rand/]. Objectivists do not specify what would be the legitimate expanse of the state's territory, nor what would be the proper way of reaching political decisions without violating the rights of disagreeing minorities[http://en.liberpedia.org/Proper_government].

===Objectivism's rejection of the "primitive"===
Jennifer Burns in her biography ''[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', notes how Rand's position that "Native Americans were savages", and that as a result "European colonists had a right to seize their land because native tribes did not recognize individual rights", was one of the views that "particularly outraged libertarians."&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns also notes how Rand's position that "Palestinians had no rights and that it was moral to support Israel, the sole outpost of civilization in a region ruled by barbarism", was also a controversial position amongst libertarians, who at the time were a large portion of Rand's fan base.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Libertarians and Objectivists often disagree about matters of foreign policy. Rand's rejection of what she deemed to be "primitivism" extended to the [[Middle East peace process]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RandArabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aynrand.org/404|title=404|author=|date=|website=aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Arab-Israeli War of 1973]], Rand denounced [[Arabs]] as "primitive" and "one of the least developed cultures" who "are typically nomads."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt; Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being "the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent", while decreeing that "when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt;

Most scholars of the libertarian [[Cato Institute]] have opposed military intervention against Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/bottom-line-iran-costs-benefits-preventive-war-versus-deterrence|title=The Bottom Line on Iran: The Costs and Benefits of Preventive War versus Deterrence|first1=Justin Logan December|last1=4|first2=|last2=2006|date=4 December 2006|website=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Objectivist [[Ayn Rand Institute]] has supported forceful intervention in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5207&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021 Peikoff, Leonard, "End States That Sponsor Terrorism,"] October 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=5336&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1221&amp;page=NewsArticle "Iran and the 'Axis of Evil,'"] ''The Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights'',  Feb 4, 2002 (retrieved 4-16-09);&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rand's influence on libertarianism ==

The United States [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]'s first candidate for [[President of the United States]], [[John Hospers]], credited Rand as a major force in shaping his own political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John, ''Libertarianism'', Nash, 1971; "Conversations with Ayn Rand," ''Liberty'', July 1990, pp. 23-36, and Sept. 1990, pp. 42-52; and, "Memories of Ayn Rand," ''Full Context'', May, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Boaz]], executive vice president of the [[Cato Institute]], an American libertarian [[think tank]], described Rand's work as "squarely within the libertarian tradition" and that some libertarians are put off by "the starkness of her presentation and by her cult following."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boaz |first=David |title=Ayn Rand at 100 |date=February 2, 2005 |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3661 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] described Rand as "an utterly intolerant and dogmatic person who did a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best of Both Worlds |last=Doherty |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |journal=Reason |date=June 1995 |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Rand biographer quoted [[Murray Rothbard]] as saying that he was "in agreement basically with all [Rand's] philosophy," and saying that it was Rand who had "convinced him of the theory of [[natural rights]]..."&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Barbara, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', Doubleday, 1984, p. 413; according to his biographer, [[Justin Raimondo]], Rothbard wrote a letter to Rand declaring, "''Atlas Shrugged'' is the greatest novel ever written," Raimondo, Justin, ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard'', Prometheus Books, 2000, p. 118, cf. Rothbard, Murray, "Letters: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand," ''The National Review'', January 18, 1958, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothbard would later become a particularly harsh critic of Rand, writing in ''The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult'' that:

{{quote|The major lesson of the history of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[objectivist]&lt;/nowiki&gt; movement to libertarians is that It Can Happen Here, that libertarians, despite explicit devotion to reason and individuality, are not exempt from the mystical and totalitarian cultism that pervades other ideological as well as religious movements. Hopefully, libertarians, once bitten by the virus, may now prove immune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult |year=1972 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html |accessdate=2009-08-04}} Rothbard's essay was later revised and printed as a pamphlet by ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine in 1987, and by the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some Objectivists have argued that Objectivism is not limited to Rand's own positions on philosophical issues and are willing to work with and identify with the libertarian movement. This stance is most clearly identified with [[David Kelley]] (who separated from the Ayn Rand Institute because of disagreements over the relationship between Objectivists and libertarians), [[Chris Sciabarra]], [[Barbara Branden]] (Nathaniel Branden's former wife), and others. Kelley's [[The Atlas Society|Atlas Society]] has focused on building a closer relationship between "open Objectivists" and the libertarian movement[https://www.sflacademy.org/introduction-to-objectivism/].

== Rand's view of libertarians ==

Rand condemned libertarianism as being a greater threat to freedom and capitalism than both modern liberalism and conservatism.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_libertarians|title=FAQ|author=|date=|website=www.aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regarded Objectivism as an integrated philosophical system. Libertarianism, in contrast, is a political philosophy which confines its attention to matters of public policy. For example, Objectivism argues positions in [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]], whereas libertarianism does not address such questions. Rand believed that political advocacy could not succeed without addressing what she saw as its methodological prerequisites. Rand rejected any affiliation with the libertarian movement and many other Objectivists have done so as well.&lt;ref name="Schwartz, Peter 1988 pp. 311–333"&gt;Schwartz, Peter, "Libertarianism: the Perversion of Liberty," in ''[[The Voice of Reason (book)|The Voice of Reason]]'', L. Peikoff, editor (1988) New American Library, pp. 311–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand said of libertarians that:
{{quote|They're not defenders of capitalism. They're a group of publicity seekers.... Most of them are my enemies... I've read nothing by Libertarians (when I read them, in the early years) that wasn't my ideas badly mishandled—i.e., the teeth pulled out of them—with no credit given."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;}}

In a 1981 interview, Rand described libertarians as "a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people" who "plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

Responding to a question about the Libertarian Party in 1976, Rand said:
{{quote|The trouble with the world today is philosophical: only the right philosophy can save us. But this party plagiarizes some of my ideas, mixes them with the exact opposite—with religionists, anarchists and every intellectual misfit and scum they can find—and call themselves libertarians and run for office."&lt;ref name="answers73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ayn Rand Answers, the Best of Her Q&amp;A |isbn=0-451-21665-2 |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Rapprochement ==
In 2011, [[Yaron Brook]], then-Executive Director of the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], spoke at the [[Foundation for Economic Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ayn Rand’s Moral Defense of Capitalism |url=http://www.fee.org/news/ayn-rands-moral-defense-of-capitalism/ |accessdate=2012-09-19 |first=Brian |last=Aitken |publisher=Foundation for Economic Education |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216165042/http://www.fee.org/news/ayn-rands-moral-defense-of-capitalism/# |archive-date=2011-12-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a keynote speaker at FreedomFest 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keynote Speakers |url=http://freedomfest.com/2012/keynote-speakers/ |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809220913/http://freedomfest.com/2012/keynote-speakers/# |archive-date=2013-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on ReasonTV on July 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yaron Brook: Ayn Rand vs. Big Government |publisher=ReasonTV |url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/07/26/yaron-brook-ayn-rand-vs-big-government |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayn Rand Institute board member [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] spoke at the Cato Club 200 Retreat in September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cato Institute |title=Self Ownership and the Financial Crisis |url=http://www.cato.org/multimedia/daily-podcast/self-ownership-financial-crisis |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed "The Real Causes of the Financial Crisis" to ''Cato's Letter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cato Institute |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv10n1.pdf |accessdate=2012-09-19 |title=The Real Causes of the Financial Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke at Cato's Monetary Conference in November, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/multimedia/daily-podcast/fedas-destruction-wealth |publisher=Cato Institute |title=The Fed's Destruction of Wealth |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2012, the [[Cato Institute]] announced that [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] would become its next president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pressroom.php?display=news&amp;id=209 |title=Cato Institute and Shareholders Reach Agreement in Principle |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cato's public announcement, Allison was described as a "revered libertarian." In communication to Cato employees, he wrote, "I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Slate |title=Cato Shrugged: Panic About An Incoming Leader's Admiration for Ayn Rand |first=David |last=Weigel |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/08/30/cato_shrugged_panic_about_an_incoming_leader_s_admiration_for_ayn_rand.html |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2012-09-19}} Allison leaves "objectivists" uncapitalized.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2012, Brook explained the changes to ''[[The American Conservative]]'':

{{quote|I don’t think there’s been a significant change in terms of our attitude towards libertarians. Two things have happened. We’ve grown, and we’ve gotten to a size where we don’t just do educational programs, we do a lot more outreach and a lot more policy and working with other organizations. I also believe the libertarian movement has changed. It’s become less influenced by Rothbard, less influenced by the anarchist, crazy for lack of a better word, wing of libertarianism. As a consequence, because we’re bigger and doing more things and because libertarianism has become more reasonable, we are doing more work with them than we have in the past. But I don’t think ideologically anything of substance has changed at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/yaron-brook-on-the-ayn-rand-institutes-newfound-ecumenism/ |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |title=Yaron Brook on the Ayn Rand Institute’s Newfound Ecumenism |first=Jordan |last=Bloom |publisher=The American Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

'''Paleoconservatism''' (sometimes shortened to '''paleocon''') is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political philosophy]] stressing [[tradition]], [[limited government|limited Federal government]] and [[civil society]], along with [[Christian values|religious]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regional]], [[Nationalism|national]] and [[Western world|Western]] identity.{{efn|For more discussion of defining elements of paleoconservative thought, see {{harvnb|Gottfried|1993}}, {{harvnb|Gottfried|2006}}, and {{harvnb|Scotchie|2017b}}.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Williamson |first=Chilton, Jr. |date=January 2011 |title=What Is Paleoconservatism?

According to the [[international relations]] scholar [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], "paleoconservatives press for restrictions on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], a rollback of [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] programmes, the [[States' rights|decentralization of federal policy]], the restoration of [[Protectionism|controls upon free trade]], a greater emphasis upon [[economic nationalism]] and [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy]], and a generally [[Revanchism|revanchist]] outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race".{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=318}} Practitioners of this philosophy identify themselves as the legitimate heirs to the American conservative tradition.{{sfn|Woltermann|1993}}

[[United States|American]] politician [[Pat Buchanan]] was strongly influenced by the Rockford Institute's ''[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]''{{sfn|Kopff|2006|p=96}} and helped create another paleoconservative publication, ''[[The American Conservative]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Joiner |first=Whitney |date=September 2002 |title=Paleocons' Revenge; American Conservative L.L.C. to Launch American Conservative Magazine |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_2002_Sept_1/ai_92836524 |magazine=Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020092305/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_2002_Sept_1/ai_92836524 |archive-date=October 20, 2004 |access-date=January 24, 2014 |via=FindArticles |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Paleo Persuasion"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Francis |first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel T.

The political theorist [[Paul Gottfried]] is credited with coining the term{{sfn|McDonald|1999|p=75}} in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He says the term originally referred to various Americans, such as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Traditionalist Catholicism|traditionalist Catholics]] and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Southern United States|Southerners]], who turned to [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Gottfried|2006}}

==Core beliefs==

===Name===
The prefix "paleo" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''[[wikt:paleo-|παλαιός]]'', meaning "ancient" or "old". It is somewhat [[:wikt:tongue-in-cheek|tongue-in-cheek]] and refers to the paleoconservatives' claim to represent a more historic, authentic conservative tradition than that found in [[neoconservatism]]. Adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as "paleo". Neoconservative [[Rich Lowry]] of ''[[National Review]]'' claims the prefix "is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of post–Cold War politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lowry |first=Richard |author-link=Rich Lowry |year=2005 |title=Reaganism v. Neo-Reaganism |url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/reaganism-v-neo-reaganism-432 |url-access=subscription |magazine=The National Interest |issue=79 |publisher=Center for the National Interest |pages=35–41 |issn=1938-1573 |jstor=42897547 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paleoconservatives use the term "[[conservatism|conservative]]" somewhat differently from some American opponents of [[Left-wing politics|leftism]]. Paleoconservatives may reject attempts by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and others to graft short-term policy goals—such as [[school choice]], [[enterprise zone]] and [[faith-based initiatives]]—into the core of conservatism. This is mainly due to the paleoconservatives' desire to see these incorporated as long-term institutional goals, rather than short-term victories for the movement itself. In this way, paleoconservatives are generally regarded as taking the "long view" toward [[American conservatism]], willing to suffer temporary setbacks while never taking their aim off the goal of establishing the primacy of conservative thought into [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Limbaugh |first=Rush |author-link=Rush Limbaugh |date=October 17, 2005 |title=Holding Court |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110007417 |work=Wall Street Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043433/http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110007417 |archive-date=January 11, 2010 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, [[Samuel T. Francis]], [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]] and some other paleoconservatives de-emphasized the "conservative" part of the "paleoconservative" label, saying that they do not want the ''status quo'' preserved.{{sfn|Francis|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Foer |first=Franklin |author-link=Franklin Foer |date=July 22, 2002 |title=Home Bound |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/home-bound |magazine=The New Republic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001193300/http://www.tnr.com/article/home-bound |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming and [[Paul Gottfried]] called such thinking "stupid tenacity" and described it as "a series of trenches dug in defense of last year's revolution".{{sfn|Gottfried|Fleming|1988|p=xv}} Francis defined authentic conservatism as "the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Francis |first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel T.

The earliest mention of the word "paleoconservative" listed in [[LexisNexis|Nexis]]&lt;ref&gt;Search conducted September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} is an article by [[J. Patrick Lewis]] in the October 20, 1984 issue of ''[[The Nation]]'', referring to academic economists who allegedly work to redefine poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lewis |first=J. Patrick |author-link=J. Patrick Lewis |date=October 20, 1984 |title=Willing Goodness |magazine=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth edition of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' lists a generic, informal use of the term, meaning "extremely or stubbornly conservative in political matters". Outside of the United States, the word is sometimes spelled "palaeoconservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Reid |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Reid (English journalist) |date=May 31, 2003 |title=Diary |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2003/05/diary-394/ |url-access=limited |magazine=The Spectator |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative heritage===
Many paleoconservatives identify themselves as [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|classical conservatives]] and trace their philosophy to the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] Republicans of the interwar period{{cn|date=December 2017}} which influenced the United States not to join the [[League of Nations]], reduce immigration with the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] and oppose [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. They often look back even further, to [[Edmund Burke]] as well as the [[Anti-Federalism|anti-federalist]] movement that stretched from the days of [[Thomas Jefferson]] to [[John C. Calhoun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rockwell |first=Llewellyn H., Jr. |author-link=Lew Rockwell |date=May 2, 2002 |title=What I Learned from Paleoism |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/05/lew-rockwell/what-i-learned-from-paleoism/ |website=LewRockwell.com |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as paleoconservatives' non-interventionism stems from their skepticism as to what extent, if any, [[Western culture]] can be transplanted or forced upon non-Western cultures, paleoconservatives' opposition to immigration is rooted in their skepticism of the ability of non-Western peoples to adopt European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lubinskas |first=James|date=November 30, 2000 |title=The End of Paleoconservatism |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/archives/politics/lubinskas11-30-00p.htm |dead-url=yes |magazine=FrontPage Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020612232153/http://www.frontpagemag.com/archives/politics/lubinskas11-30-00p.htm |archive-date=June 12, 2002 |access-date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, paleoconservatives are most distinctive in their emphatic opposition to open [[immigration]] by non-Europeans{{sfn|Machnik|2015}} and their general disapproval of United States intervention overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Samuel T. Francis]] wrote: {{quote|We believe that the United States derives from and is an integral part of European civilization and the European people and that the American people and government should remain [[European Americans|European in their composition and character]]. We therefore oppose the massive immigration of non-European and non-Western peoples into the United States that threatens to transform our nation into a non-European majority in our lifetime.

===Human nature, tradition and reason===
Paleoconservatives argue that since [[human nature]] is limited and finite, any attempt to create a man-made [[utopia]] is headed for disaster and potential carnage. Instead, they lean toward tradition, family, customs, religious institutions and classical learning to provide wisdom and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peppe |first=Enrico |date=April 27, 2004 |title=Thomas Molnar: The Counter-Revolution |url=http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article3366.html |website=IntellectualConservative.com |access-date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming stated this opposition to abstract ideals in a way that critic [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] called a "startling crescendo":
{{quote|Among the most dangerous of our theoretical illusions are the political fantasies that can be summed up in words like democracy; equality, and natural rights; the principle of one man, one vote and the American tradition of self-government. No one who lives in the world with his eyes open can actually believe in any of this.&lt;ref name="Buchananism"&gt;{{cite news| title=Buchananism: An Intellectual Cause| first=David| last=Brooks |author-link=David Brooks (cultural commentator) | work=The Weekly Standard| date=11 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The political scientist [[W. Wesley McDonald]] explains the opposition to [[ideology]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} this way:
{{quote|In a humane social order, a community of spirit is fostered in which generations are bound together. According to [Russell] Kirk, this link is achieved through moral and social norms that transcend the particularities of time and place and, because they form the basis of genuine civilized existence, can only be neglected at great peril. These norms, reflected in religious dogmas, traditions, humane letters, social habit and custom, and prescriptive institutions, create the sources of the true community that is the final end of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russell Kirk and the Age of Ideology by W. Wesley McDonald |url=http://www.umsystem.edu/upress/spring2004/mcdonald.htm |publisher=University of Missouri Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105180429/http://www.umsystem.edu/upress/spring2004/mcdonald.htm |archive-date=January 5, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Along these lines, [[Joseph Sobran]] argues in his ''Pensees'' that [[Western civilization]] relies on civility at the center of the society:
{{quote|Civility is the relationship among citizens in a republic. It corresponds to the condition we call "freedom," which is not just an absence of restraint or coercion, but the security of living under commonly recognized rules of conduct. Not all these rules are enforced by the state; legal institutions of civility depend on the ethical substratum and collapse when it is absent. And in fact the colloquial sense of civility as good manners is relevant to its political meaning: citizens typically deal with each other by consent, and they have to say "please" and "thank you" to each other.&lt;ref name="f_pensees.htm"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sobran |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Sobran |year=1985 |title=''Pensees'': Notes for the Reactionary of Tomorrow |magazine=National Review |volume=37 |issue=25 |location=New York |page=28 |issn=0028-0038}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Certain paleoconservatives say that tradition is a better guide than reason. For example, [[Mel Bradford]] wrote that certain questions are settled before any serious deliberation concerning a preferred course of conduct may begin. This ethic is based in a "culture of families, linked by friendship, common enemies, and common projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=M.&amp;nbsp;E. |author-link=Mel Bradford |year=1990
|title=The Reactionary Imperative: Essays Literary and Political |location=Peru, Illinois |publisher=Sherwood Sugden |page=129}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Murphy|2001|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So a good conservative keeps "a clear sense of what Southern grandmothers have always meant in admonishing children, 'we don't do that'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=M.&amp;nbsp;E. |author-link=Mel Bradford |year=1990
|title=The Reactionary Imperative: Essays Literary and Political |location=Peru, Illinois |publisher=Sherwood Sugden |pages=119, 121}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Murphy|2001|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming calls tradition "a body of wisdom and truth and a set of attitudes and behavior handed down from one generation to another. It is our parents' respect for their grandfathers that we reflect when we refuse to think ourselves wiser than our ancestors and do not presume to condemn their shortcomings".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} By following tradition, Sobran said that society can maintain continuity with the past through words, rituals, records, commemorations and laws: {{quote|There is no question of "resisting change." The only question is what can and should be salvaged from "devouring time." Conservation is a labor, not indolence, and it takes discrimination to identify and save a few strands of tradition in the incessant flow of mutability. In fact conservation is so hard that it could never be achieved by sheer conscious effort. Most of it has to be done by habit, as when we speak in such a way as to make ourselves understood by others without their having to consult a dictionary, and thereby give a little permanence to the kind of tradition that is a language.&lt;ref name="f_pensees.htm"/&gt;}}

Furthermore, James Kalb argues that tradition succeeds where ideology fails because it includes habits and attitudes about things that are hard to articulate rationally. Many aspects of social life resist clear definition, so technocratic approaches to social policy deserve suspicion: {{quote|Our knowledge is partial and attained with difficulty. The effects of political proposals are difficult to predict and as the proposals become more ambitious their effects become incalculable. We can't evaluate political ideas without accepting far more beliefs, presumptions and attitudes than we could possibly judge critically.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kalb |first=Jim |title=Jim Kalb's Conservatism FAQ |url=http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/chris.holt/home.informal/lounge/politics/conservativism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629205328/http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/chris.holt/home.informal/lounge/politics/conservativism/ |archive-date=June 29, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Concrete roots===

{{quote|The decadence of a civilization by loss of faith and vigour can be observed more than once in history. What is extraordinary about the American situation is the stupidity. The Romans, such is my impression, did not become stupid and incompetent with their decadence. Americans have not lost faith in their cultural inheritance—they have been entirely separated from it.

Paleoconservatives tend to dislike abstract principles presented without connection to concrete roots, like religion, heritage, or traditional institutions. This distaste for [[universalism]] includes the doctrinal conclusions by [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Neo-scholasticism|neo-Thomists]] and [[Straussians]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} For example, Bradford wrote in ''A Better Guide Than Reason'' (citing [[Michael Oakeshott]]): {{quote|The only freedom which can last is a freedom embodied somewhere, rooted in a history, located in space, sanctioned by genealogy, and blessed by a religious establishment. The only equality which abstract rights, insisted upon outside the context of politics, are likely to provide is the equality of universal slavery. It is a lesson which Western man is only now beginning to learn.{{sfn|Bradford|1994|p=xviii}}}}

Some paleoconservatives also profess a conservative value-centered [[historicism]],{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} which Gottfried defines as "the belief that historical circumstances set values".&lt;ref name="The Real Cabal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/September2003/0903Francis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106021320/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/September2003/0903Francis.html |archivedate=January 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinguished from [[nihilism]], [[postmodernism]], and [[moral relativism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Francis argued that this position is a "Burkean appeal to tradition".&lt;ref name="The Real Cabal"/&gt; For example, [[Edmund Burke]] wrote in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'':
{{quote|I cannot stand forward, and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a simple view of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. Circumstances (which with some gentlemen pass for nothing) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind.{{sfn|Burke|1790|pp=7–8}}}}

[[Claes G. Ryn]] says that life has "an enduring purpose, but one that manifests itself differently as individuals and circumstances are different".{{sfn|Ryn|1998|p=90}} He writes: {{quote|For the conservative, the universal imperative that binds human beings does not announce its purpose in simple, declaratory statements. How, then, does one discern its demands? Sometimes only with difficulty. Only through effort can the good or true or beautiful be discovered, and they must be realized differently in different historical circumstances. The same universal values have diverse manifestations. Some of the concrete instantiations of universality take us by surprise. Because there is no simple roadmap to good, human beings need freedom and imagination to find it. Universality has nothing to do with uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig5/ryn2.html |title=Where in the World Are We Going? by Claes G.

===Anti-federalism===
{{seealso|New Federalism}}
Anti-federalism (see the [[Anti-Federalism|American anti-Federalist movement]]) is another key aspect of paleoconservatism, which adherents see as an antitype to the [[managerial state]]. The paleoconservative flavor urges honoring the principle of [[subsidiarity]], that is decentralized government, local rule, private property and minimal bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In an international context, this view would be known as [[federalism]] and paleoconservatives often look to [[John C. Calhoun]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/young-andrew/young-andrew11.html |title=Rescuing Calhoun by Andrew Young |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=July 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the role of statecraft in society, Fleming says it should not be confused with soulcraft. He gives his summary of the paleoconservative position:{{quote|Our basic position on the state has always been twofold: 1) a recognition that man is a social and political animal who cannot be treated as an "individual" without doing damage to human nature. In this sense libertarian theory is as wrong and as potentially harmful as communism. The commonwealth is therefore a natural and necessary expression of human nature that provides for the fulfillment of human needs, and 2) the modern state is a cancerous form of polity that has metastasized and poisoned the natural institutions from which the state derives all legitimacy—family, church, corporation (in the broadest sense), and neighborhood. Thus, it is almost always a mistake to try to use the modern state to accomplish moral or social ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Anarcho-Tyranny_Roc.writeback|title=Anarcho-Tyranny Rockford Style

This is intended to ward off centralization and protect community sentiment by putting the decision-making power closer to the populace. He rooted this in the Christian notion of original sin as since humanity is flawed, society should not put too much power in a few hands. Gerald J. Russello concluded that this involved "a different way of thinking about government, one based on an understanding of political society as beginning in place and sentiment, which in turn supports written laws".{{sfn|Russello|2004}}

This anti-federalism extends to culture too.  In general, this means that different regional groups should be able to maintain their own distinct identity. For example, Fleming and Michael Hill argue that the American South and every other region have the right to "preserve their authentic cultural traditions and demand the same respect from others". In the Southern context, they call on citizens to "take control of their own governments, their own institutions, their own culture, their own communities and their own lives" and "wean themselves from dependence on federal largesse". They say:{{quote|A concern for states' rights, local self-government and regional identity used to be taken for granted everywhere in America. But the United States is no longer, as it once was, a federal union of diverse states and regions. National uniformity is being imposed by the political class that runs Washington, the economic class that owns Wall Street and the cultural class in charge of Hollywood and the Ivy League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dixienet.org/rights/newdixiemanifesto.shtml |title=League of the South |website=Dixienet.org |accessdate=April 1, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In a similar fashion, [[Pat Buchanan]] argued during the 1996 campaign that the social welfare should be left to the control of individual states. He also called for abolishing the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and handing decision-making over to parents, teachers and districts. Controversies such as [[evolution]], [[Desegregation busing|busing]] and [[curriculum]] standards would be settled on a local basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pa-00-0725-stagnaro.html|title=Pat Buchanan on the American Future|last1=Stagnaro|first1=Carlo|date=July 24, 2000|work=The Laissez Faire City Times|accessdate=November 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008152646/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-00-0725-stagnaro.html|archivedate=October 8, 2008|issue=Vol 4, No 30|ref=stagnaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he opposed a 1998 Puerto Rican statehood plan on the grounds that the island would be ripped from its cultural and linguistic roots: "Let [[Puerto Rico]] remain Puerto Rico, and let the United States remain the United States and not try to absorb, assimilate and Americanize a people whose hearts will forever belong to that island".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-98-0915.html "Let Puerto Rico Remain Puerto Rico", Pat Buchanan]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826002334/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-98-0915.html|date=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Paleoconservatives often argue that modern managerial society is a threat to stable [[families]]. [[Allan C. Carlson]], former president of the [[Rockford Institute]], argues: {{quote|The family is the natural and fundamental [[social unit]], inscribed in our nature as human beings, rooted in marriage, rooted in the commitment to bring new life into the world, and rooted in a deep respect for both ancestors and posterity.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_ffus.htm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_ffus.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=January 19, 1999 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515153031/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_ffus.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He calls this a universal rule of human nature, true for Westerners and non-Westerners alike. He also argues that happiness "comes through natural family bonds" and that "the future of any nation shall be by way of the family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060215.korea.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515155131/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060215.korea.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines family as "a man and a woman living in a socially sanctioned bond called marriage for the purposes of propagating and rearing children, sharing intimacy and resources, and conserving lineage, property, and tradition".&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=November 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515135728/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| To be human is to be familial. Any significant departure from the family rooted in stable marriage, the welcoming of children, and respect for ancestors and posterity—any deviation from this social structure makes us in a way less "human": that is, I think it fair to say, the true message of modern science.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_ffus.htm"/&gt;}}

Sobran picks up this same theme, saying that heterosexual marriage is hard-coded into human nature: {{quote|[Even] the Pope can’t change the nature of marriage. It existed, by necessity of human nature, long before Jesus or even Abraham... This has nothing to do with mere disapproval of sodomy. Even societies that were indifferent to sodomy saw no reason to treat same-sex domestic partnerships as marriages. Why not? Because such unions don’t produce children... To put it as unromantically as possible, people who have children should be stuck with each other, sharing the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald N.

Paleoconservatives also question the validity of [[gender feminism]] in similar ways, some questioning feminism in both its radical and moderate forms. They say that the push for total gender equality dehumanizes both men and women, damaging the [[nuclear family]] and sacralizing abortion. Certain attitudes toward feminism also create room for the managerial state to try engineering sexual equality. Gottfried described this position, which was influenced by scholar Allan Carlson, thus: {{quote|The change of women's role, from being primarily mothers to self-defined professionals, has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family. Rather than being the culminating point of Western Christian gentility, the movement of women into commerce and politics may be seen as exactly the opposite, the descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos.&lt;ref name="gottfried051702.htm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/| title=The Trouble with Feminism| first=Paul| last= Gottfried}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Post-family order====
[[Allan C.

He argues that there is a permanent tension between the family and "individualist, industrialized society".&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911035252/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says the modern "abstract state" too often sees the family as "its principal rival" and tries to suppress it. It can also hurt family living by the [[unintended consequences]] of public policy with good intentions.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt; He also chides American Republicans "for consistently favoring Wall Street over Main Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/press/thc.pr.060320.htm |title=THC: The Howard Center: Press Release |publisher=Profam.org |date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201181329/http://profam.org/press/thc.pr.060320.htm |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to the "abstract state", Carlson argues the state must recognize that men and women "are different in reproductive, economic, and social functions", even though they share political and property rights.&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"/&gt; He says that churches and other religious bodies must step in and help rebuild "family-centered communities".&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt; As for common people, he says: {{quote|Men and women are both called home to rebuild families with an inner sanctity, to relearn the authentic meanings of the ancient words husbandry and housewifery, and to exercise the natural family functions of education, the care of the weak, charity, and a common economic life.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt;}}

Carlson argues that the family's greatest challenge in the early 21st century comes from what he calls "soft [[totalitarianism]]s", which are "packaged around a militant secular individualism, but still seeking to build a marriage-free, post-family order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_frc_sfl_040616.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145035/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_frc_sfl_040616.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes same-sex marriage, the left's association of family values with [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060211.econ.abort.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=February 11, 2006 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515141532/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060211.econ.abort.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[equity feminism]]".&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"/&gt; Francis uses similar ideas to argue that society should regulate sexual behavior, specifically laws against sodomy and gays in the military.&lt;ref&gt;"Sex and consequences", ''The Washington Times'', February 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirkian legacy===
[[Russell Kirk]] (1914–1994) is a key figure in paleoconservatism, in that several of his books present an outline of a pervasive Anglo-American conservative tradition that exists despite many other distinctions. His own career stretched long enough to for him to defend [[Robert A. Taft]] in the 1950s, write for ''[[National Review]]'' during the Cold War, criticize neoconservatism in the 1980s and give speeches supporting Buchanan in 1992. One neoconservative writer, Dan Himmelfarb, even refers to Kirk's ''The Conservative Mind'' as "the seminal work of paleoconservatism", even though it was first published in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams |first=Elliott |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V85I5P56-1.htm |title=Time For Obama To Embarrass His Own VP? |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420233102/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V85I5P56-1.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk developed six "canons" of conservatism.{{sfn|Kirk|1986|pp=8–9}} Gerald J. Russello described them thus:
{{quote|(1) a belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, divine revelation, or natural law; (2) an affection for the "variety and mystery" of human existence; (3) a conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize "natural distinctions;" (4) a belief that property and freedom are closely linked; (5) a faith in custom, convention and prescription; and (6) a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which is a respect for the political value of prudence.{{sfn|Russello|2004|p=109}}}}

In addition, Kirk said that "all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief".{{sfn|Kirk|2014}}

Kirk called [[libertarianism|libertarians]] "chirping sectaries" by quoting [[T. S. Eliot|T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] and said that they and conservatives have nothing in common apart from their opposition to [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kirk |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Kirk |year=1981 |title=Libertarians: Chirping Sectaries |url=https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf |journal=Modern Age |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=345, 349 |access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the movement "an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating".&lt;ref name="Kirk 1981, p. 349"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kirk |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Kirk |year=1981 |title=Libertarians: Chirping Sectaries |url=https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf |journal=Modern Age |volume=25 |issue=4 |page=349 |access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said a line of division exists between believers in "some sort of transcendent moral order" and "utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct", libertarians being in the latter category.&lt;ref name="Kirk 1981, p. 349"/&gt;

Kirk also popularized the Anglo-Irish statesman [[Edmund Burke]] as the prototypical conservative—and many paleoconservatives consider him a hallowed ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101RoundTable.htm |title=Law, Morality, and Religion |first=Stephen B. |last=Presser |publisher=Chronicles Magazine |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404042403/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101RoundTable.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, he represents a vital link between the American right and the greater tradition of British customs and [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://users.etown.edu/m/mcdonaldw/Kirkbc.htm| title=Russell Kirk's Conservative Mind| first=W.

Counter-revolutionary (Roman Catholic) European precursors to the paleoconservatives include [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Juan Donoso Cortés]], [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] and [[Pope Pius IX]], specifically in the [[Roman Catholic]] traditionalist subset of paleoconservatism.

{{quote|This new, paganized Western society under the comprehensive state would have come as much less of a surprise to us if we'd paid more attention to the two great English Catholic writers of the pre-Bolshevik period. Hilaire Belloc and G.K. Chesterton saw it coming.

In 1912, Belloc predicted the rise of a new form of tyranny, which he called "the Servile State," neither capitalist nor socialist, in which one part of the population would be forced to support the other. He was not always accurate in detail, but he was right in principle. He saw that the cellular structure of Christian society was under assault.

Chesterton agreed. Together both men resisted modernity in religion, morality, politics, economics, and art. They celebrated the Middle Ages, small private property, and above all Catholicism. In a famous epigram, typically defiant in its simplicity, Belloc proclaimed: "Europe is the Faith, and the Faith is Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondspring.co.uk/articles/sobran.htm |title=sobran |publisher=Secondspring.co.uk |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other historical sources referenced by paleoconservatives include [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]].{{sfn|McDonald|1999|p=75}} Contrarian leftists such as [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Christopher Lasch]] and [[Paul Piccone]] have also influenced the movement.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993|p=154}} Modern European continental conservatives [[Jacques Barzun]], [[Alain de Benoist]] and [[René Girard]] have also been praised by paleoconservatives.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Southern tradition===
Paul V. Murphy wrote that they developed "a particularistic politics of [[states' rights]] and [[Localism (politics)|localism]], which they combine with a cultural and social criticism defined by Christian and patriarchal [[organicism]]".{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=218}} He also says the Southern traditionalist worldview evolved into what appeared in ''Chronicles'' from the mid-1980s onward, a focus on national identity mixed with regional particularity, plus skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power. They also said the mainstream view of the old South was distorted. For example, Bradford said: {{quote|The way to look at the institution of slavery is not backward from 1991 but forward from the hundred years before 1860. Slavery was like the rising and setting of the sun, a fixture of life. In pre-Colonial times, everyone was racist, except a few [[Quakers]]. Jefferson thought that Negroes were not capable of taking care of themselves, that they were somewhere between helpless children and orangutans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cartwright |first=Gary |date=March 1992 |title=Mr. Right |url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/1992-03-01/academia.php |magazine=Texas Monthly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023810/http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/1992-03-01/academia.php |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1995 "New Dixie Manifesto", Thomas Fleming and Michael Hill argued that Southerners are pelted with ethnic slurs, denied self-government and stripped of their symbols, including the [[Confederate flag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagueofthesouth.net/static/homepage/intro_articles/newdixiemanifesto.html leagueofthesouth.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233755/http://www.leagueofthesouth.net/static/homepage/intro_articles/newdixiemanifesto.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote,
{{quote|After so many decades of strife, black and white Southerners of good will should be left alone to work out their destinies, avoiding, before it is too late, the urban hell that has been created by the lawyers, social engineers and imperial bureaucrats who have grown rich on programs that have done nothing to help anyone but themselves.}}

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] revisited the Southern paleo critique of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his book ''[[The Real Lincoln]]''. He gives it a [[paleolibertarian]] twist, saying the president followed [[mercantilism]], [[protectionism]] and the example of [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo94.html |title=Getting Lincoln Half Right and Half Wrong by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] was about destroying the right of [[secession]], not freeing slaves.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Furthermore, he claims that the praise Lincoln commonly receives from conservatives is misguided: {{quote|The Gettysburg Address was brilliant oratory, but it was also political subterfuge. As [[H. L. Mencken|H.&amp;nbsp;L. Mencken]] pointed out, it was the Southerners who were fighting for the [[consent of the governed]] and it was Lincoln's government that opposed them. They no longer consented to being governed by Washington, D.C.  Lincoln's admonition that government "of the people, by the people, for the people" would perish from the earth if the right of secession were sustained was equally absurd. The United States remained a democracy, and the Confederate States of America would have been a democratic country as well.  Lincoln's notion that secession would "destroy" the government of the United States is also bizarre in light of the fact that after secession took place the US government fielded the largest and best-equipped army and navy in the history of the world up to that point for four long years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo31.html |title=Claremont's Court Historians by Thomas J.

As for the 1861–1865 conflict, Wilson suggests it be referred to as "The War to Preserve Southern Independence". Fleming argues that secession was legal: {{quote|Those who hold the opinion (false and easy to refute) that the United States in 1860 were an amalgamated central state believe that the secession of [[South Carolina]] and the other Southern states was illegal, an act of wickedness that can be explained only by the desire of evil Southerners to defend slavery. Thus, in the upside-down and fact-free world of leftists like [[Harry Jaffa]], the war was a "civil war" between the citizens of the same state or, better yet, a rebellion. Abolitionists clearly did not believe this, because after the War, they insisted that Southern states had left the Union and needed to be reconstructed. Everybody knew that it is a basic principle of international law, going back to [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] at least, that in a confederated state the members have a right to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Random_Thoughts.writeback |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927172901/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Random_Thoughts.writeback |archivedate=September 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He said that Middle Americans in both regions face the same threats.&lt;ref&gt;An Infantile Disorder, Chronicles, February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Brooks, a neoconservative critic, says that paleoconservatives do not dream of seeing slavery reborn. Instead, he concludes that they link rural communities to a transcendent order and ancient institutions: {{quote|They do not shy away from expressing their true beliefs, and if they supported slavery they would probably say so. They merely believe in the social hierarchies. In those southern communities, they say, social roles were crucial to happiness and ordered sociability. "[[Aristotle]] recognized that a well-ordered society protected an ascending order of good through the institutionalization of rank", Fleming and co-author [[Paul Gottfried]] wrote in their book ''The Conservative Movement''. They are talking about the social pecking order in old-time towns—the folks who live on the hill, the merchants on Main Street, the village idiot on the green. On a larger scale, the paleocons contrast the virtues of the republic with the corruptions of empire. The empire throws its weight around in the world; the republic minds its own business.&lt;ref name="Buchananism"/&gt;}}

Open hostility broke out in the mid-1980s and was never resolved.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}} Some paleoconservatives argued that [[fusionism]] failed&lt;ref name="(Con)fusion on the Right"/&gt; and suggested a new alliance on the right to stand outside the neoconservative consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antiwar.com/raimondo/book1.html| title=The Old Right and the Future of Conservatism| first= Patrick J.| last= Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan stated that "We are old church and old right, anti-imperialist and anti-interventionist, disbelievers in ''Pax Americana''".&lt;ref name="Buchananism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/what-is-left-what-is-right/ "What is Left? What is Right?"]. ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] (ISI) still follows the old fusionism.{{sfn|Edwards|2003|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;6}} It showcases both neoconservative and Old Right ideas, such as [[anti-interventionism]], limited government and cultural regionalism, in its publications and conferences. While it favors free-market solutions it tends to recognize the limitations of the market, or as economist [[Wilhelm Röpke]] says, "the market is not everything". ISI scholarship includes analysis of [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and [[distributist]] works, along with the idea of an "humane economy".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvnb|Röpke|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One fusionist, [[James Burnham]], influenced paleocons, especially Francis. Gottfried said that the two men believed that social forces create ideologies—and that "moral visions are the mere accompaniments of the process by which classes make themselves economically dominant and try to control other groups".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=63}}

===International parallels===
As paleoconservatism germinated as a reaction to neoconservatism,{{sfn|Scotchie|2017a|p=1}} most of its development as a distinct political tendency under that name has been in the United States, although there are parallels in the traditional Old Right of other Western nations.

'''Paternalism''' is action limiting a person's or group's liberty or autonomy which is intended to promote their own good.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Gerald, "Paternalism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffrin, Seana. 2000. "Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation". ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 29(3): 205–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

The word paternalism is from the Latin ''pater'' "father" via the adjective ''paternus'' "fatherly", which in Medieval Latin became ''paternalis''. Some, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: "It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood."&lt;ref name=Mill1859&gt;Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) "On Liberty", published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Joel. 1986. ''Harm to Self''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Soft and hard===
Soft Paternalism is the view that paternalism is justified only if an action to be committed is involuntary. [[John Stuart Mill]] gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. We can't tell the person the bridge is damaged as he doesn't speak your language. According to Soft paternalism we would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so we could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then we should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes we are entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#Intr |title=Paternalism |author=Gerald Dworkin |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure and impure===
Pure paternalism is paternalism where the person(s) having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Moral and welfare===
Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well being of a person(s) even if their welfare wouldn't improve. For example, it would be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering prostitution is morally corrupting.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

== Criteria for effective paternalism ==
[[Thomas Pogge]] argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World poverty and human rights|date=2008|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4143-0|edition=2nd|url=http://thomaspogge.com/paternalism/|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds. 
*The criteria should be minimally intrusive.
*The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs.
*The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations.{{elucidate|date=March 2015}}

In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argues (against [[Robert Filmer]]) that political and paternal power cannot be identified.

[[John Stuart Mill]] opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In ''On Liberty'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.&lt;ref name=Mill1859/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal [[autonomy]].

==In society==

In the southern [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of [[slavery]]. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses' protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved's counterpart in the factory-based north.&lt;ref&gt;Erin R. Mulligan, “Paternalism and the Southern Hierarchy: How Slaves Defined Antebellum Southern Women,” Armstrong Undergraduate ''Journal of History'' 2, no. 2, August 2012 [https://www.armstrong.edu/history-journal/history-journal-paternalism-and-the-southern-hierarchy-how-slavery-defined]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this conclusion, often the whites would manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.edu/historia/Cole.pdf|title=The Excuse of Paternalism in the Antebellum South: Ideology or Practice?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternalism was also used against [[Women's Suffrage]], with opponents of women's suffrage saying that granting women the right to vote would make their lives harder and separate them from their families.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10988">[[Political culture]] is a part of a society for which shared attitudes and beliefs establish a unique identity with regard to public and private [[governance]]. In the [[United States]], at least three political cultures took root during the colonial period. They were formed in [[New England]] by religious refugees from England, in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic region]] by Dutch settlers, in Virginia by English adventurers seeking fortune in the [[New World]], and in Carolina by English investors who envisioned a model constitutional society. In Virginia and Carolina, and later elsewhere in the South, [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] settlers influenced the cultural hearth that created the [[American South]]. Each began with established cultures of the [[British Isles]] and the [[Netherlands]], evolving into unique cultures that remain in existence today in the United States.

==Research on the political culture of the US==
The political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] identified three primary political cultures, generally consistent with those{{examples needed}} of Tocqueville. ''Moralistic'' political culture evolved out of New England and is characterized by an emphasis of community and civic virtue over individualism. ''Individualistic'' political culture arose from [[New Netherland|Dutch influence in the Mid-Atlantic region]]; it regards multiculturalism as a practicality and government as a utilitarian necessity. ''Traditionalistic'' political culture arose in the South, which elevates social order and family structure to a prominent role. It accepts a natural hierarchy in society and where necessary to protect society, authoritarian leadership in the political and religious realms.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, ''American Federalism'', pp. 93–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of traditionalistic political culture is often thought to have arisen principally out of Virginia, the first and most populous southern colony. Virginia was also the most politically powerful state after the Revolution: pursuant to the first census of the United States in 1790 it held a greater percentage of congressional representatives than any other state has ever enjoyed up to the present day. Nevertheless, others argue that South Carolina had the greater influence as a result of its [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina|Grand Model]] enabling slaveholders from Barbados to establish a durable aristocracy. That unique convergence produced a slave society with a majority black population rigidly controlled by the plantation elite. Maintaining such a society required intense political resolve and the development of a mythology of white racial supremacy. The South Carolina hybrid model ultimately spread across the [[Deep South]] and was unwavering in its promotion of southern culture, whereas Virginia and other Upper South states were less comfortable with the region’s “[[peculiar institution]]” of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Ashley Cooper Plan'', pp. 142–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientist Richard Ellis identified egalitarianism, individualism, and hierarchy as defining cultures in American political culture. These principal categories correspond closely with Elazar’s classification. According to Ellis, each of these cultures lays claim to the ideals of equality and liberty articulated by [[John Locke]], but what they are claiming is an only a piece of Locke, and one that is not necessarily consistent with the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''American Political Cultures'', pp. 1–3, 28–29, 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular authors have found similar divisions within American political culture. Colin Woodard identified eleven “rival regional cultures,” while Joel Garreau identified nine.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, ''American nations''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garreau, ''Nine Nations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social psychologist Peter J. Rentfrow led a research effort that generally supports Elazar's theory of political culture, while finding that psychological variables allow for a more fine-grained geographical analysis. His research on “psychological topography” was based on multiple samples of more than a million respondents. The researchers found “overwhelming evidence for regional variation across the United States on a range of key political, economic, social, and health indicators.”&lt;ref&gt;Rentfrow, et al., “Divided We Stand,” pp. 996–1009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appalachian and frontier political culture==

Many settlers who populated the South took to the backcountry, eventually crossing the Appalachians. Of these, the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] originating from northern Ireland and the border region between England and Scotland were among the largest and most influential. They were militantly Christian and inured to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion’s Seed'', pp. 605–39&lt;/ref&gt; While they might be considered a distinct political culture in colonial times, they eventually developed a symbiotic relationship with the southern plantation elite. As W. J. Cash wrote in ''The Mind of the South'', “the tradition of aristocracy met and married with the tradition of the backwoods.”&lt;ref&gt;Cash, ''The Mind of the South'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frontier Thesis]] advanced by the historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in 1893 argued that American culture, including political culture, was forged as Americans moved west. It was violent and individualistic and yet contained a primitive form of egalitarianism. In Elazar’s view, however, it was the South that acquired these traits most and carried them west to Missouri, Texas, and eventually as far as Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt'', pp. xv–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lockean liberalism and political culture==

In another unifying thesis about political culture that, like the [[Frontier Thesis]], some have argued that Lockean [[liberalism]] is a central underlying explanation of American political culture. Notably, the political scientist [[Louis Hartz]] argued that the nation’s founding principles, which were largely drawn from Locke, created a new political culture that was unique to the United States.  The nation “begins with Locke,” he wrote, and it “stays with Locke.” He found that [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was first to recognize this when he saw that the nation was the first to create its own democratic future without having to endure revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hartz, ''The Liberal Tradition in America'', pp. 6, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban-rural divide==

Political culture can be seen as bifurcated by urban and rural geography. The United States was largely a rural nation until 1920. When the census that year revealed that urban Congressional Districts would exceed those of rural areas, rural congressmen refused to approve [[United States Congressional Apportionment|reapportionment]], the only time that has happened.&lt;ref&gt;Martis and Elmes, ''Historical Atlas of State Power''.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural divide remains to the present with rural areas often associating with traditionalistic political culture, while urban areas are more often aligned with moralistic and individualistic political culture.

==Re-aggregation of political cultures in metropolitan areas==
Researchers Dante Chinni and James Gimpel identified twelve cultural communities found throughout the United States, with varying degrees of geographic concentration. The categories are derived from analysis of statistical data, and they offer a more realistic portrayal of the geographically discontinuous cultural fabric of the nation than blanket state and regional categories.&lt;ref&gt;Chinni and Gimpel, ''Our Patchwork Nation''.&lt;/ref&gt; In physical space, as in [[cyberspace]], people increasingly sort themselves into communities of choice. That is, people chose where they will live and who they will communicate with. The opportunity to make such choices appears to reinforce political culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, ''The Big Sort''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue durée'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reformism''' is a political doctrine advocating the [[reform]] of an existing system or institution instead of its abolition and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/reformism | title=Reformism | author=Collins English Dictionary | year= | website= | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | accessdate=8 August 2017 | quote= a doctrine or movement advocating reform, esp political or religious reform, rather than abolition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[socialist]] movement, reformism is the view that gradual changes through existing institutions can eventually lead to fundamental changes in a society’s [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. Reformism as a political tendency and hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that revolutionary upheaval is a necessary precondition for the structural changes necessary to transform a [[capitalist]] system to a qualitatively different socialist economic system.

As a doctrine, reformism is distinguished from the act of pragmatic reform: pragmatic reform aims to safeguard and permeate the status quo by preventing fundamental structural changes to it, whereas reformism posits that an accumulation of reforms can eventually lead to the emergence of entirely different economic and political systems than those of present-day capitalism and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today and Jesus followers | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | website= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are two types of reformism. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on the ability for [[social democratic]] reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old.

Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical: it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism, but it tries to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], under reformism, "(capitalism) is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm | title=Do We Support Reformist Demands? | author=Duncan Hallas | year=1973 | website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands? | publisher=International Socialism | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "non-reformist reforms", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms for improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution |title=Do we need reform of revolution?|author=Lois Clifton |date=November 2011 |publisher=Socialist Review |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1875 [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) adopted a [[Gotha Program]] that proposed "every lawful means" on a way to a "socialist society" and was criticized by [[Karl Marx]] who considered the [[communist revolution]] a required step. One of the delegates to the SPD congress,  [[Eduard Bernstein]], expanded on the concept, proposing ''evolutionary socialism''. Bernstein was a leading [[social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany. Reformism was quickly targeted by [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemning Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm Rosa Luxemburg. ''Reform or Revolution'' (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt; While Luxemburg died in the [[German Revolution]], the reformists soon found themselves contending with the [[Bolsheviks]] and their satellite [[Communism|communist]] parties for the support of intellectuals and the [[working class]].

In 1959, the [[Godesberg Program]] (signed at a party convention in the West German capital of [[Bad Godesberg]]) marked the shift of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from a Marxist program espousing an end to capitalism to a reformist one focused on social reform.

After [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power in the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Comintern]] launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]".  According to ''[[The God that Failed]]'' by [[Arthur Koestler]], a former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the largest communist party in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Interwar period]], communists, aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], continued to consider the "social fascist" Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in [[Germany]], even after the [[Nazi Party]] had gotten into power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler, Arthur]]. ''[[The God That Failed]].'' Edited by [[Richard Crossman]]. Bantam Matrix, Tenth Edition. pp 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, reformists are seen as [[centre-left]]. Some social democratic parties, such as the Canadian [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, are still considered to be reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/ndp.html#3|title=The Socialist Vanguard and the New Democratic Party|last=Dowson|first=Ross|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformism in the British Labour Party==
The term was applied to elements within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1950s and subsequently, on the party's right. [[Anthony Crosland]] wrote ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term. For Crosland, the relevance of [[nationalization]] (or [[public ownership]]) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary [[full employment]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] management of the economy and reduced [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation. In 1960, after the third successive defeat of his party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] attempted to reformulate the original wording of [[Clause IV]] in the party's constitution, but proved unsuccessful.

Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell, principally [[Roy Jenkins]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left the Labour Party in 1981 to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], but the central objective of the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]] was eventually achieved by [[Tony Blair]] in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995.

The use of the term is distinguished from the [[gradualism]] associated with [[Fabianism]] (the ideology of the [[Fabian Society]]), which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated with Bernstein and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected [[Marxism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">In [[politics]], a '''regime''' (also known as "'''régime'''", from the original French spelling) is the [[form of government]] or the set of rules, cultural or [[social norms]], etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society.

==Usage==

While the word ''régime'' originates as a synonym for any type of government, modern usage has given it a negative [[connotation]], implying an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] government or [[dictatorship]]. Webster's definition states that the word ''régime'' refers simply to a form of government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regime Regime] as defined in the [[Merriam–Webster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''regime'' as "a government, especially an authoritarian one".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/regime?q=regime Regime] as defined in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Contemporary academic usage of the term "regime" is broader than popular and journalistic usage, meaning "an intermediate stratum between the government (which makes day-to-day decisions and is easy to alter) and the state (which is a complex bureaucracy tasked with a range of coercive functions)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merip.org/mer/mer273/breakdown-gcc-initiative Breakdown of the GCC Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[global studies]] and [[international relations]] the concept of ''regime'' is also used to name international regulatory agencies (see [[International regime]]), which lie outside of the control of national governments. Some authors thus distinguish analytically between institutions and regimes while recognizing that they are bound up with each other:

::{{cquote|Institutions as we describe them are publicly enacted, relatively-enduring bodies of practice, procedures and norms, ranging from formalized legal entities such as the WTO to more informal but legally-buttressed and abiding sets of practices and regimes such as the liberal capitalist market. The key phrases here are ‘publicly enacted’ and ‘relatively enduring’. The phrase ‘publicly enacted’ in this sense implies active projection, legal sanction, and often as not, some kind of opposition.&lt;ref name="James_Palen"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2007 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Palen | first2= Ronen | title= Globalization and Economy, Vol. 3: Global Economic Regimes and Institutions | url= https://www.academia.edu/4251331/Globalization_and_Economy_Vol._3_Global_Economic_Regimes_and_Institutions_editor_with_Ronen_Palan_Sage_Publications_London_2007 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, regimes can be defined as sets of protocols and norms embedded either in institutions or institutionalized practices – formal such as states or informal such as the "liberal trade regime" – that are publicly enacted and relatively enduring.&lt;ref name="James_Palen"/&gt;

'''Regulatory capture''' is a form of [[government failure]] which occurs when a [[regulatory agency]], created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [[interest group]]s that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Regulatory Capture Definition | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | publisher = Investopedia  | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When regulatory capture occurs, the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

For [[public choice theory|public choice theorists]], regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl"&gt;Timothy B.

Regulatory capture theory is a core focus of the branch of public choice referred to as the [[Regulatory economics|economics of regulation]]; economists in this specialty are critical of conceptualizations of governmental regulatory intervention as being motivated to protect [[public good]]. Often cited articles include Bernstein (1955), Huntington (1952), Laffont &amp; Tirole (1991), and Levine &amp; Forrence (1990). The theory of regulatory capture is associated with [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[George Stigler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Regulatory Capture 101: Impressionable journalists finally meet George Stigler | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509  |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of its main developers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Amann (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=akSneB10pJ0C&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Regulating Development: Evidence from Africa and Latin America''] Google Books.

Likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, [http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf "Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083041/http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that a regulatory agency should be protected from outside influence as much as possible. Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government. However, increased transparency of the agency may mitigate the effects of capture. Recent evidence suggests that, even in mature democracies with high levels of transparency and media freedom, more extensive and complex regulatory environments are associated with higher levels of corruption (including regulatory capture).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with federalism ===
There is substantial academic literature suggesting that smaller government units are easier for small, concentrated industries to capture than large ones. For example, a group of states or provinces with a large timber industry might have their legislature and/or their delegation to the national legislature captured by lumber companies. These states or provinces then becomes the voice of the industry, even to the point of blocking national policies that would be preferred by the majority across the whole [[federation]]. Moore and Giovinazzo (2012) call this "distortion gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440445_The_Distortion_Gap_Policymaking_under_Federalism_and_Interest_Group_Capture|title=The Distortion Gap: Policymaking under Federalism and Interest Group Capture|first1=Ryan|last1=T.

The opposite scenario is possible with very large industries, however. Very large and powerful industries (e.g. energy, banking, [[Military–industrial complex|weapon system construction]]) can capture national governments, and then use that power to block policies at the federal, state or provincial level that the voters may want,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Economic rationale===
The idea of regulatory capture has an obvious economic basis, in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers,&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl" /&gt; each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, this invariably features current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with contacts in the industry. Capture is also facilitated in situations where consumers or taxpayers have a poor understanding of underlying issues and businesses enjoy a knowledge advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmr.berkeley.edu/search/articleDetail.aspx?article=5779|title=Thin Political Markets: The Soft Underbelly of Capitalism|website=cmr.berkeley.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as Jon Hanson and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media, academia and popular culture, thus they will try to capture them as well. This phenomenon is called "deep capture".&lt;ref&gt;Jon D. Hanson and David G. Yosifon, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=938005 ''The Situation: An Introduction to the Situational Character, Critical Realism, Power Economics, and Deep Capture''] Abstract at [[Social Science Research Network]].

Regulatory public interest is based on market failure and welfare economics. It holds that regulation is the response of the government to public needs. Its purpose is to make up for market failures, improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and maximize social welfare. Posner pointed out that the [[public interest theory]] contains the assumption that the market is fragile, and that if left unchecked, it will tend to be unfair and inefficient, and government regulation is a costless and effective way to meet the needs of social justice and efficiency. Mimik believes that government regulation is a public administration policy that focuses on private behavior. It is a rule drawn from the public interest. Irving and Brouhingan saw regulation as a way of obeying public needs and weakening the risk of market operations. It also expressed the view that regulation reflects the public interest.

== Development ==
The review of the United States' regulation of history at the end of the 19th century, especially the regulation of railway tariffs by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, revealed that regulations and market failures are not relevant. At least until the 1960s, in terms of regulatory experience, regulation was developed in the direction of favoring producers, and regulation increased the profits of manufacturers within the industry. In potentially competitive industries such as the trucking industry and the taxi industry, regulations allow pricing to be higher than cost and prevent entrants.In the natural monopoly industries such as the electric power industry, there are facts that regulation has little effect on prices, so the industry can earn profits above normal profits. Empirical evidence proves that regulation is beneficial to producers.

These empirical observations have led to the emergence and development of regulatory capture theory. Contrary to regulatory public interest theory, regulation capture theory holds that the provision of regulation is adapting to the industry's need for regulation, that is, the legislator is controlled and captured by the industry in regulation, and the regulation institution is gradually controlled by the industry. That is, the regulator is captured by the industry.The basic view of the regulatory capture theory is that no matter how the regulatory scheme is designed, the regulation of an industry by a regulatory agency is actually "captured" by the industry. The implication is that regulation increases the profits of the industry rather than social welfare.

The above-mentioned regulatory capture theory is essentially a purely capture theory in the early days, that is, the regulators and legislators were captured and controlled by the industry. The later regulatory models such as Stiegler (Stigler Model)-Pelzmann (Pelzmann Model)-Becker (Becker Model) belong to the regulatory capture theory in the eyes of Posner (1974) and others. Because these models all reflect that regulators and legislators are not pursuing the maximization of public interests, but the maximization of private interests, that is, using "private interest" theory to explain the origin and purpose of regulation. Aton (1986) argues that Stigler's theoretical logic is clear and more central than the previous "capture theory" hypothesis, but it is difficult to distinguish between the two.

Regulatory capture theory has a specific meaning, that is, an experience statement that regulations are beneficial for producers in real life. In fact, it is essentially not a true regulatory theory. Although the analysis results are similar to the Stigler model provide interpretation and support for the regulatory capture theory is beneficial for producers, however the analysis methods of the latter are completely different. Stigler used standard economic analysis methods to analyze the regulation behavior, then created a new regulatory theory - regulatory economic theory. Of course, different divisions depend on the criteria for division, and they essentially depend on the researchers' different understanding of specific concepts.

Justice Douglas’ dissent in [[Sierra_Club_v._Morton#Justice Douglas' dissent|Sierra Club v Morton]] describes concern that regulatory agencies become too favorable with their regulated industries.

== Types ==
There are two basic types of regulatory capture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobinproject.org/sites/tobinproject.org/files/assets/Kwak%20-%20Cultural%20Capture%20and%20the%20Financial%20Crisis.pdf |title=Preventing Regulatory Capture |first1=Daniel |last1=Carpenter |first2=David A. |last2=Moss |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corralling Capture |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/370256/doc/slspublic/corrralling_caputure.pdf |first=David Freeman |last=Engstrom |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Materialist capture''', also called ''financial capture'', in which the captured regulator's motive is based on its material self-interest. This can result from bribery, [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving doors]], political donations, or the regulator's desire to maintain its government funding. These forms of capture often amount to [[political corruption]].
* '''Non-materialist capture''', also called ''cognitive capture'' or ''cultural capture'', in which the regulator begins to think like the regulated industry. This can result from interest-group lobbying by the industry.
Another distinction can be made between capture retained by big firms and by small firms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadin|first=Sharon|date=2015|title=Too Small to Fail: State Bailouts and Capture by Industry Underdogs|url=http://law.capital.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=35862|journal=43 Capital University Law Review 889|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stigler mainly referred, in his work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|date=1971|title=The Theory of Economic Regulation|url=|journal=2 BELL J.

SCI.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to large firms capturing regulators by bartering their vast resources (materialist capture) – small firms are more prone to retain non-materialist capture via a special underdog rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Frank N. von Hippel]], despite the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) has often been too timid in ensuring that America's 104 commercial reactors are operated safely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nuclear power is a textbook example of the problem of "regulatory capture"—in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=frank%20von%20hippel&amp;st=cse |title=It Could Happen Here |author=Frank Von Hippel |date=March 23, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a paper by Stanford University economics professors John B. Taylor and Frank A. Wolak compared the financial services and nuclear industries. While acknowledging both are susceptible in principle to regulatory capture, they concluded regulatory failure – including through regulatory capture – has been much more of a problem in the financial industry and even suggested the financial industry create an analog to the [[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]] to reduce regulatory risk.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Drell-Shultz_NuclearEnterprise_ch13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rita Marie Lavelle''' (born 1946) is a [[United States]] and [[California|California State]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political figure. In 1984, Lavelle was convicted on federal charges of [[perjury]] related to an investigation into misuse of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s "[[Superfund]]" money during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the [[Stringfellow Acid Pits]], a major hazardous waste site. The Lavelle incident was labeled "Sewergate" or "Garbagegate" by the newspapers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/524/000026446/ Michael Deaver]. nndb.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, Lavelle was convicted again on unrelated federal charges of one count of [[wire fraud]] and two counts of [[making false statements]] to the F.B.I. Lavelle committed these crimes in her NuTECH Enterprises, Inc. business of environmental consultation.

==Biography==
In 1969, Lavelle earned her bachelor's degree in Biology and Mathematics, with a minor in chemistry, from [[Holy Names University]] in [[Oakland, California]]. She continued her graduate work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in physiological chemistry and stoichiometry. She earned a master's degree cum laude in business administration from [[Pepperdine University]] in 1980.

From 1969 to 1976, she was the [[California State Consumer Affairs Department]] information officer, state director of consumer education, and publications assistant in the office of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. She was director of marketing for Intercontinental and Continental Chemical Corporation in Sacramento, California, from 1976 to 1978. Lavelle's responsibilities included development of corporate guidelines to comply with the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]], a law that her later position at the EPA left her to administer nationwide compliance with by both business and government sectors. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Beginning in 1978, Lavelle initiated, directed and managed several programs for [[Aerojet-General Corporation]] subsidiaries; these included programs for divisions which manufactured chemicals and industrial and chemical intermediates, nuclear and chemical waste treatment systems, [[liquid rocket engines]] for the aerospace industry, and high-speed marine propulsion systems for defence applications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

When Lavelle joined Aerojet-General Corporation, she became director of communications for one subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Co., until 1979, moving to a similar communications position for the largest subsidiary, Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co., in 1979.

In 1981, she was named one of the outstanding women in aerospace by ''Aerospace Magazine''.

On February 18, 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced his intention to nominate Lavelle for assistant administrator of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] for solid waste and emergency response. Her position included directing the hazardous waste control program and the $1.6 billion "[[Superfund]]" program which provides for the emergency cleanup of chemical spills and hazardous waste dumps.

EPA Administrator [[Anne Gorsuch]] described Lavelle as bringing "over 12 years of professional experience in state government and private industry to the agency", and went on to say that "she has demonstrated expertise in getting results, as shown by her record with the executive branch of government in California, with a mid-sized chemical firm and with a large diversified international corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Rita M. Lavelle |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=February 18, 1982 |url=http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/oswer/lavelle.htm |accessdate=June 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618104612/http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/oswer/lavelle.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavelle had held several positions of responsibility in the California [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]], including membership on the executive board of directors of California Federated Republican Women and the [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] and [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] central committees.

==Superfund scandal==
Lavelle was indicted on federal perjury charges after an investigation was launched based on evidence submitted by another EPA employee, [[whistleblower]] [[Hugh Kaufman]]. The evidence showed that Lavelle was involved with misuse of the EPA's "Superfund" money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/green-life/neil-gorsuch-s-family-has-checkered-history-when-it-comes-environmental-protection|title=Neil Gorsuch’s Family Has a Checkered History When It Comes to Environmental Protection|author=David Helvarg |date=February 1, 2017|website=sierraclub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a major hazardous waste site. In 1984, Lavelle was convicted of lying to the Congress and served three months of a six-month prison sentence, paid a $10,000 fine and was under probation for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shabecoff|first=Philip|date=January 10, 1984|title=Rita Lavelle gets 6-month term and is fined $10,000 for perjury|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|volume=|issue=|page=A1|id=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html|accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=May 25, 1987|title=Morality Among the Supply-Siders|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|volume=|issue=|page=3|id=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964451,00.html|accessdate= June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental conviction==
Lavelle and a partner owned NuTECH Enterprises, Inc., an [[environmental consulting]] firm in [[Oceanside, California]]. Lavelle and Robert V. Cole, a part owner of [[Denova Environmental, Inc.]], a [[hazardous waste]] storage facility in [[Rialto, California]], forged documents that purportedly bore the signature of Joseph Bertelli, the owner of Lemco Corporation in [[South Los Angeles]], to make it appear that Bertelli owed Cole's company more than $52,000 for the removal and storage of hazardous waste. Those documents were used to obtain $36,441 from Capital Partners USA, Inc. Only when Capital Partners attempted to collect from Bertelli did it realize that Bertelli had neither signed the documents nor agreed to the bill, and Denova had never removed hazardous waste for Lemco. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On September 24, 2004, a jury in [[Los Angeles]] federal court found Lavelle guilty of one count of [[wire fraud]] and two counts of [[making false statements]] to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Cole pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced on December 16, 2004, to one year of probation and was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine. Lavelle was sentenced on January 10, 2005 to 15 months in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Former E.P.A. official sentenced to federal prison for defrauding owner of Los Angeles HazMat site|publisher=United States Attorney's Office, Central District of California|date=January 10, 2005|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2005/002.html|accessdate= November 18, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115172148/http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/pr2005/002.html|archivedate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Lavelle, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] # 29753-112, was released on July 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Inmate Locator]."

{{Liberalism sidebar |Variants}}

'''Secular liberalism''' is the separation of [[culture]] and [[politics]] from [[religion]]. A subcategory of [[liberalism]] and [[secularism]], it supports the [[separation of religion and state]] particularly from the ideas of the [[Christian Church]]. Christian ideals are usually to be found on the opposite end of the spectrum from secular liberalism. Secular liberalism is often connected with standing for [[social equality]] and [[political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/secular_liberalism_as_consensu.html |title = ''Secular Liberalism as Consensus'' |author=Rod Dreher |date=6 April 2011 |publisher = Real Clear Politics |accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/40148.html | title = ''Secular liberalism misunderstood''| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = | accessdate = 2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Adherents of secular liberalism believe in the [[disestablishment]] of the Christian Church.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/29/clegg-disestablishment-church-england | title = ''Clegg should assert secular liberalism''| publisher = The Guardian | date = 29 April 2010| accessdate = 2011-06-09 | location=London | first=Theo | last=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular liberalism also depends on the conviction that religious tradition and belief has no binding authority on society.&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics"/&gt; Public promoters of secular liberalism, such as Dawkins call for a clear distinction between the teaching of religion as a historical and cultural phenomenon and the teaching of religion as fact. Dawkins has likened using education to indoctrinate children with a particular religion to [[child abuse]]. One of the central tenets of the ideology is separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Among those who follow secular liberalism are [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Ayaan Hirshi Ali]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Practices that are considered to be illiberal are reformed in a state that practices secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/29/clegg-disestablishment-church-england | title = Secular Liberalism and Moral Psychology of Identity''| publisher = Economic and Political Weekly| date = 1997-10-04| accessdate = 2012-02-21| location=London| first=Theo| last=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal measures have failed in the past because no effort is made to make a concept of the goods that the community has cherished in the past.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; This lack of reason-giving apparatus is called [[communitarianism]] and it used to criticize the liberal state as a coercive organization.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; Communitarianism essentially advocates a sense of intra-community (community-wide) democracy.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt;

In a modern democratic society, a plurality of conflicting doctrines share an uneasy co-existence within the framework of civilization.

== Contemporary application ==
=== Arab Spring ===
Secular liberalism is sometimes connected with the [[Arab Spring]] protests. One commentator labels it as a "secular liberal fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/09/tahrir-square-aflame-imaginary-revolution |title=Tahrir Square aflame: the visual basis of an imaginary revolution |author=Jonathan Jones |date=9 December 2011 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 February 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have labeled the motivations behind it, and the temporary governments created as a result as secular liberalism.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= After the Arab Spring: How Islamists Hijacked the Middle East Revolts|last=Bradley |first=John |year= 2012|publisher= |location= |isbn= 0-230-33819-4|page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Islamism is Winning |author=John M. Owen IV |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/opinion/why-islamism-is-winning.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=Razib |year= 2012|title= Secular liberals the tip of the Islamist spear|journal= Discover Magazine|volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/01/secular-liberals-the-tip-of-the-islamist-spear/|accessdate=14 January 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes, participation in the newly crowned democratic governments by the Muslim clerics are ignored in favor of the protesters' secular liberal ideas. Since 2011, more residents of the Middle East have been demanding a greater say in the running of their governments. They want democracy to appear in a uniquely Muslim fashion rather than through some artificial "secular" movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goingtotehran.com/2014/02 |title=America and the Middle East: It’s Déjà Vu All Over Again |author=Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
The [[French ban on face covering]] has been attributed by some to be a result of secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="hizb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hizb.org.uk/current-affairs/french-face-veil-ban-highlights-the-failings-of-secular-liberalism | title = French Face Veil Ban Highlights The Failings Of Secular Liberalism| publisher = Hizb ut-Tahrir | date = 14 September 2010| accessdate = 13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban by the [[French Senate]] on September 14, 2010 outlawed coverings, including religious ones such as the [[burqa]]. Some [[Islam in France|French Muslims]] have found secular liberalism to be an ideology where prejudice against a minority group is used to win [[vote]]s.&lt;ref name="hizb"/&gt; According to the [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] group, based out of the United Kingdom, women are secluded from society and made [[outcast (person)|outcast]]s in society for trying to be [[Modesty|modest]].&lt;ref name="hizb"/&gt; The group has also criticized other European countries for similar bans on religious dress.

== Criticism ==
The [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]] are waging a common fight against secular liberalism; claiming that this idea violates the traditional Christian concepts of family and human values by exposing people to medico-biological experiments that are incompatible with their ideas of human dignity.&lt;ref name="interfax"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=7927 | title = ''Moscow Patriarchate, Vatican wage common fight against secular liberalism - Patriarch Kirill''| publisher = Interfax-Religion | date = | accessdate = 2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern over trends in some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] communities towards liberalizing theology and Christian morals; he claims them to be products of secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="interfax"/&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]], offering [[freedom of speech]], has been criticized in a 2004 political manifesto by [[David Fergusson (theologian)|David Fergusson]] entitled ''Church, state and civil society''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17147">'''Taxation of the Jews in Europe''' refers to taxes imposed specifically on [[Jewish]] people in [[Europe]], in addition to the taxes levied on the general population.  Special taxation imposed on the Jews by the state or ruler of the territory in which they were living has played an important part in Jewish history.&lt;ref name="Judaica"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ancienttaxation.html Taxation. Encyclopaedia Judaica.] Reproduced by Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of special taxes on the Jews followed their admission to civil rights in France and elsewhere in Europe at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Judaica"/&gt;

== In the Roman Empire ==
The [[Fiscus Judaicus]] ([[Latin]]: "Jewish tax") or "Temple Tax" was a [[tax]] collecting agency instituted to collect the tax imposed on [[Jewish diaspora#Post-Roman Diaspora|Jews]] in the [[Roman Empire]] after the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE in favor of the temple of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter Capitolinus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 CE.  Vespasian imposed the tax in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 65.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

== In the Holy Roman Empire ==
The Jewish populations of Europe were politically insecure and could be easily exploited for the levying of heavy taxes in exchange for official protection. The high interest rates charged by Jews became an illimitable source of tax revenue and Jewish wealth was technically easy to gauge because Jews typically stored their assets in the form of cash or promissory notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Imperial Tax Register of 1241 was the first register to include taxes on the Jews. The total of the taxes on the Jews listed in the Register amounted to 857 silver marks; the total contribution of all the cities together amounted to 4.290 silver marks. These local taxes served wholly or in part to finance town-building. Not all of the contributions reached the central administration. In contrast, it is clear from the Register that the payments made by the Jews reached the Exchequer in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 13&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes on the Jews were first described as the ’’Jewish Tax’’ in 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opferfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. This taxation was 1 florin for every Jew and included assets worth more than 20 florins. Widows were not exempted. King Wenceslas removed the taxable minimum but an exemption for Jews dependent on alms was made later by Sigsmund, who himself levied heavy taxation. Sigsmund taxed a third of the value of Jewish properties. It was represented as a coronation tax as part of Sigsmund's attempts to ascend the throne.  Isenmann disagrees and believes it was an innovation sprouted by Archchamberlain Konrad von Weinsberg. By 1433-4 the tax collectors were collecting tax worth a half of Jewish properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Triers]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG. Encyclopaedia Judaica]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leibzoll ==

The ''[[Leibzoll]]'' or ''Judengeleit'' was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler | title=The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA669| year=1906| publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Hungary ==
[[Tolerance tax]] (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], beginning in 1747.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Poland ==

=== Koło ===
In 1571 a contract was drafted with regard to the status of the Jews in [[Koło]], in which the city's Christians have undertaken to provide protection to the Jews, in return for which the Jews were required to pay a special annual municipal tax.&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;Mahler, Rafael. [http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/kolo/kol008.html "From the near and far past".  Some information about the history of the Jews of Koło.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729 the Jewish community was required to pay 150 gold coins as an annual poll tax, and in 1738 this sum was increased to 300 gold coins.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

In 1775 the Polish parliament imposed a special duty on books written in [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], requiring each book to be stamped by the municipality. Despite heavy penalties imposed on owners of unstamped books, many books were concealed and unstamped.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

== In Russia ==
The Russian [[Kosher tax]], known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==In Galicia==
Between 1777 and 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the southeast corner of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], paid a number of special taxes, including the "protection and [[tolerance tax]]", and the "property and occupation tax". In 1784, the property and occupation tax was replaced with the kosher meat tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Moldavia==
In 1741, Moldavian prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the crupca, an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=925 Iaşi, by Lucian-Zeev Herşcovici ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Altona and Hamburg ==
During the period 1641&amp;ndash;1842, the [[Jews]] of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (then a town close to Hamburg) paid specifically Jewish taxes as well as the same taxes as other residents of Altona. The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents.

In 1640 the Danish King [[Christian IV]] acquired part of the [[Holstein-Pinneberg|County of Pinneberg]] including Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Altona was subsequently granted the rights and status of a town on 23 August 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Hamburg ===

The community was founded principally by Portuguese merchants and was known as the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Portuguese-Jewish Community]], although many of its members were of Spanish-Jewish descent. 

These [[Sephardic Jews]], who initially pretended to be persecuted [[Catholic]]s, first came to [[Hamburg]] at the end of the 16th century. They were mostly Portuguese- or Spanish-speaking merchants. In 1621, when the armistice between [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]] came to an end, many of the Portuguese Jews moved to Hamburg. They were made welcome, even after the actual situation had become clear; however they were not permitted to establish a cemetery within the city walls. Thanks to the linguistic skills of the Sephardim and their contacts among their co-religionaries they controlled a large sector of the German market in provisions. The Sephardim differed culturally and socially from the Jews who came to Altona, and subsequently also to Hamburg, from the east. These were [[Yiddish Language]] speaking [[Ashkenazim]].
The permanent settlement of the Ashkenazim was opposed by both the [[Senate of Hamburg]] (town council) and the citizens, supported by the Sephardim, who did not wish to see the establishment of a second community in Hamburg. As servants, referred to as tudescos, the Ashkenazi Jews were, de facto, under the protection of the Sephardic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 91&amp;ndash;94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Altona ===

On 1 August 1641 the Danish king had formally granted the Ashkenazi Jews the privilege of having in Altona, as hitherto, a cemetery and a synagogue, thus providing the basis for the existence of a Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the Danish kings promised the Jews personal security, the freedom to practice trade and religious liberties. Some of the Jews living in Hamburg therefore tried  to secure the legal protection of the Danish crown in case of any attempt to expel them. In Altona the conditions of residence were favorable, in Hamburg the conditions for trading. These were the reasons for the genesis of the Altona community of Ashkenazi Jews from Hamburg and Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to immigration from the east, Altona became a center of research and scholarship in Jewish teaching, attracting hundreds of students. The officially recognized [[Beth din|Jewish court of justice]] had a reputation as one of the most distinguished in the whole Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 243&amp;ndash;244&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews did not acquire these privileges freely, but in return for the payment of taxes.

=== Levies on Jews ===

From 1584 to 1639, as in the Middle Ages, the Jews of Altona paid taxes specific to the Jews, but no further taxes. Each Jewish family was required to pay 6 [[rixdollar|Reichstaler]] per year. Under Danish rule this changed: the Jews continued to pay the specifically Jewish taxes plus the same taxes as all other residents.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; From 1641 every Jewish family was required to pay 5 Reichstaler in Jewish taxes; in the year when Altona became a town the contribution rose to 6 Reichstaler.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135, pp. 180&amp;ndash;181&lt;/ref&gt; With the ordinance of 1641 the Danish king had permitted the Jews [[shechita]]. This privilege too was not cost-free. For the years 1667&amp;ndash;1669 we have records of taxes paid by Jewish butchers. According to these the rates were 1 Mark and 8 Schillinge for an ox, 4 Schillinge for a calf and 2 Schillinge for a lamb. These taxes were twice as high as those paid by Christian butchers.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 153, pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; From 1681 Individual taxes on the Jews (6 Reichstaler plus the payments made by the Jewish butchers), were replaced by lump-sum payments by the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the year 1712 onwards it is possible to calculate the amount of the lump-sum payments made by the Jews. During the period 1712&amp;ndash;1818 this amounted to 6 Reichstaler for each Jewish family; 6 Reichstaler was the level that had already been set in 1584. Assuming that a Jewish family consisted of approximately 6 persons, 6 Reichstaler corresponded to 1 Reichstaler for each individual Jew. On top of this 1 Reichstaler, also paid by the other residents, had to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 265-266. Meaningful conversion of the face-value can be made for this period since, unlike the paper money of Copenhagen, the silver currency of Altona was stable, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents. The influence of this on business practice constituted an obstacle to the granting of civil rights. In the year 1818 the Jewish Elders declared to the community of Altona that they could not, ’’on the one hand, levy specifically Jewish taxes on the members of their community and, on the other hand, encourage our co-religionaries, especially the younger ones, to pursue useful activity. In short: so to improve our condition that we might not seem unworthy to acquire civil rights. The extension – against our wishes - of the taxes on the Jews would be incompatible with the granting of civil rights.’’&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the struggle of the Jewish community for emancipation. The Jewish community secured the abolition of taxes on the Jews in the year 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veritas''' ([[Latin]]: truth) was a [[list of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party in the United Kingdom]], formed in February 2005 by [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]] following a split from the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP). Kilroy-Silk served as party leader from formation, through the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]], until his resignation in July that year. He was succeeded by Patrick Eston, who resigned the leadership on 15 June 2008 citing frustrations of his efforts to reform the party. The party merged into the [[English Democrats]] in June 2015.&lt;ref name="Merge"&gt;{{cite web|title=English Democrats and Veritas to Merge|url=http://www.englishdemocrats.org.uk/latest-news/item/439-english-democrats-and-veritas-to-merge.html|publisher=English Democrats|accessdate=7 October 2015|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veritas had no representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], although it had members serve in the [[European Parliament]] and the [[London Assembly]], elected as UKIP members and defecting upon Veritas' formation. At the time of its merger, the party had not put forward General Election candidates since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Jamie|title=We Asked 11 Obscure Political Parties If They Should Be In The TV Debates|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamieross/beer-baccy-and-tv-debates#.vxYN6ZVgv|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=BuzzFeed News|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Robert Kilroy-Silk, a former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] shadow cabinet member and television presenter, was elected as a UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European Parliament election]] for the [[East Midlands]] region. His ambition to attain the leadership of that party was announced in October 2004, but it proved very unpopular within the party. Instead of risking disciplinary action for continuing this action, Kilroy-Silk resigned the party [[Whip (politics)|whip]], while remaining a full member and asserting his continued challenge. The plan ultimately failed, and Kilroy-Silk finally resigned from the party – as had been long expected – on 20 January 2005. Rumours circulated immediately that Kilroy-Silk was set to form his own party, fuelled by the registration of the domain name "veritasparty.com" a month earlier. An earlier rumour suggested that he had been in negotiations with the [[English Democrats]] to join and lead their party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/diary/story/0,,1372973,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Politics | first=Marina | last=Hyde | date=14 December 2004 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Veritas'' – [[Latin language|Latin]] for "truth" – was officially founded in a press conference on 2 February, during which Kilroy-Silk proclaimed "unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight", devoid of the other parties' "lies and spin". There were a number of defections from UKIP to the new party. They included UKIP London Assembly member [[Damian Hockney]], who became deputy leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4227921.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party | date=2 February 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of formation, its primary policy was opposition to [[immigration to the United Kingdom]]. It was perceived to be more specific than UKIP's general [[euroscepticism]], and almost to the point of Veritas being labelled a [[single-issue party]]. Kilroy-Silk also proposed support for the introduction of [[flat tax]] in opposition to the existing system of income tax bands varying with income. Kilroy-Silk's preferred figure was 22%, the "basic rate" band in which most UK citizens fell at the time.

The party was immediately lambasted as nothing more than a vanity vehicle for Kilroy-Silk, and was nicknamed "Vanitas" by former allies.&lt;ref&gt;Burkeman, O., [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1404364,00.html Kilroy was there], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2005. Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Kilroy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Kilroy-Silk]], the founder and first leader of Veritas.]] --&gt;

==2005 election==
The first test of Veritas' ambitions was the general election on 5 May 2005 where it had hoped to overtake UKIP as the primary party opposing the [[European Union]]. Although ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper had suggested that Veritas hoped to run candidates in every constituency in [[Great Britain]], the party ended up fielding 65 candidates in England and Wales, polling 40,481 votes, an average of 623 (1.5%).

Kilroy-Silk contested the constituency of [[Erewash (UK Parliament constituency)|Erewash]] in [[Derbyshire]]. He came fourth with 2,957 votes (5.8%); [[Liz Blackman]] was elected for Labour with 22,472. No Veritas candidates were elected; Kilroy-Silk was the only one to save his deposit.

In the subsequent [[Cheadle by-election, 2005|Cheadle by-election]] on 14 July 2005 Les Leggett of Veritas polled 218 votes (0.6%).

==Aftermath of 2005 general election==
In the wake of the poor showing in the general election, it was reported that there were many resignations from the party. Some discontented party members came to oppose Kilroy-Silk and formed the Veritas Members Association (VMA).  One of its founders, Ken Wharton, challenged Kilroy-Silk for the leadership on 12 July 2005, during the Cheadle by-election campaign but his challenge faltered due to ill health.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4675795.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy faces leadership challenge | date=12 July 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilroy-Silk resigned as party leader on 29 July.  In a press statement he said "It was clear from the general election result – and more recently that of the Cheadle by-election – that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system.  We tried and failed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4728941.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy quits as leader of Veritas | date=29 July 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further resignations included that of his chief-of-staff David Soutter and deputy leader Damian Hockney. Hockney and London Assembly Veritas representative [[Peter Hulme-Cross]] (who, like Hockney, had defected from UKIP) subsequently formed the [[One London]] party.

A leadership election was held in September 2005. Acting leader Patrick Eston defeated Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Colin Brown, and former boxer [[Winston McKenzie]] on a 22% turnout.  This, combined with a poor turnout at the party's first Annual General Meeting, is believed to have brought about the subsequent resignation of Brown and the founders of the VMA. Eston appointed a new party chairman, Alan Ainscow, who resigned from that post and the party in November.  As defections and resignations continued, a number of members and former members from Veritas and UKIP, including [[Anthony Bennett (English politician)|Anthony Bennett]] and Ken Wharton, formed a new party, the [[Popular Alliance (UK)|Popular Alliance]] in March 2006.  Eston appointed a deputy, Howard Martin, who also is the main Veritas Party spokesperson, and seemed determined to continue with the party, despite the depletion of the Veritas membership.

==2005–15==
In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|2006 local elections]], Veritas stood four candidates: two each in [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] and [[Bolton]]. They polled an average of 98 votes each (3.5% of the total). In the 2007 elections, Veritas stood three candidates: two in English council elections and one – Iain James Sheldon in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales electoral region)|Mid and West Wales]] Region for the Welsh Assembly, who received 502 votes (0.2% of the total).

In the summer of 2007, Patrick Eston contacted the leadership of other parties with similar political positions with a view to organising a meeting to discuss co-operation. While all parties were being contacted a later meeting was being arranged for September between Eston and the leaders of the [[Freedom Party (United Kingdom)|Freedom Party]] and [[United Kingdom Popular Democrats]] who had shown interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritasparty.com/news.html Proposed meeting on 31 August] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629182440/http://www.veritasparty.com/news.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2008 Patrick Eston announced that he could not take the Veritas Party in the direction he wanted and so would be resigning the party leadership.  In a resignation letter to the party membership he said:
:"I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the only way a new political party can move forward is for one person to have complete control and take all the decisions. However, I believe that members must have a say on whether that person stays as leader on a yearly basis. A sort of benevolent dictator that members can remove yearly if they so wish."

Therese Muchewicz, Party Secretary, served as Acting Leader until leadership elections in October 2008. She was subsequently elected as the new Party Leader. The party put forward no candidates in the 2010 or 2015 UK General Elections  It was subsequently announced that Veritas would merge into the English Democrats.

There exist various methods through which the [[ballot]]s cast at an [[election]] may be counted, prior to applying a [[voting system]] to obtain one or more winners.

==Manual counting==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ballot]] --&gt;
Manual counting requires a physical [[ballot]] that represents voter intent. The physical ballots are read and interpreted; then results are individually tabulated.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/primaries/sr_technology_history.html History of Voting Technology] from [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used in Sweden for example, and conducted as follows. The voter casts three ballots, one for each of the three elections (national, regional, and local), each in a sealed envelope. The party and candidate names are pre-printed on the ballot, or the voter can write them in on a blank ballot. When voting has finished, all envelopes are opened on the counting table, for one election at a time. They are sorted in piles according to party, inspecting them for validity. The piles are then counted manually, while witnesses around the table observe. The count is recorded, and the same pile is counted again. If the results do not agree, it is counted a third time. When all piles are counted and the results agree, the result is certified and transmitted for central tabulation. The count as received is made public, to allow anyone to double-check the tabulation and audit the raw data. There appears to be a high level of confidence in this system among the population, as evidenced by the lack of criticism of it.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Such a system may be used for [[recount]]s in areas where mechanical or automated counting systems are used.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Electromechanical and Optical scan counting==
{{further|Optical scan voting system}}
Paper [[ballots]], typically [[punched card]]s or [[marksense]], are collected and fed into a machine to tabulate vote totals. Tabulation can occur with each individual ballot, or in batches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/vc/vc31 Application of Technology in Vote Counting Systems] - [http://www.aceproject.org ACE Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct-recording voting (mechanical) counting==
Voters selecting switches (levers), pushing plastic chips through holes, or pushing mechanical buttons which increment a mechanical counter (sometimes called the odometer) for the appropriate candidate panot.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

==Direct-recording electronic counting==
{{main|DRE voting machine}}

Voting data and ballot images are recorded in memory components. Tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. This consolidation can be any subset of machines, such as all [[voting machine]]s in a [[polling station]], or all voting machines in a [[precinct]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eac.gov/VVSG%20Volume_I.pdf 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208184233/http://www.eac.gov/VVSG%20Volume_I.pdf |date=2006-02-08 }} from the US [[Election Assistance Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winterval''' was a season of public events in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], organised by [[Birmingham City Council]] in each of two consecutive [[winter]]s: first from 20 November to 31 December 1997,&lt;ref name="bcc1997"&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971210073015/http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |url=http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |archivedate=10 December 1997 |accessdate=21 October 2009 |date=19 November 1997 |title=Winterval 1997 |publisher=Birmingham City Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again from mid-October 1998 to mid-January 1999. The intention was to encourage people into the newly rejuvenated city centre,&lt;ref name="guar2006"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities |title=The phoney war on Christmas |first=Oliver |last=Burkeman |work=The Guardian |date=8 December 2006 |location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with [[secular]] and [[religion|religious]] events marking religious and other occasions during the relevant period. The name "Winterval" has since become used in the UK as shorthand for what are presented as attempts to  "[[Rebranding|rebrand]]" Christmas so as not to exclude non-[[Christian]]s.

== 1997 ==
The name "Winterval" was a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[winter]]'' and ''[[festival]]'', coined by the Council's Head of Events, Mike Chubb.&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/winterval-the-truth/ |title=Winterval – the truth |publisher=Pigsonthewing.org.uk |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 he explained:&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"/&gt;

{{quote|Quite simply, as head of events at that time, we needed a vehicle which could cover the marketing of a whole season of events... [[Diwali]] (the Festival of Lights), Christmas Lights switch-on, [[BBC]] [[Children in Need]], [[Aston Hall]] by Candlelight, [[Chinese New Year]], [[New Year's Eve]], etc. Also, a season that included theatre shows, an open-air [[ice-rink]], the Frankfurt Open-air Christmas Market and the Christmas seasonal retail offer. Christmas—called Christmas!—and its celebration lay at the heart of Winterval.

[[Political correctness]] was never the reasoning behind Winterval, but yes, it was intended to be inclusive—which is no bad thing to my mind—and a brand to which other initiatives could be developed as part of the Winterval offer, in order to sell the city at a time when all cities are competing against each other for the seasonal trade.}}

The programme of events in 1997 included theatre and arts events; marking of [[Diwali]]; candlelit tours of [[Aston Hall]]; an outdoor [[ice rink]]; a German-style [[Christmas market]]; [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] in the streets;  and a [[New Year's Eve]] Party.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; The front cover of the promotional brochure used the word "Christmas" three times&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; and featured a photograph of the City's official [[Christmas tree]].&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; Each of its six pages featured the word "Christmas" in text or images.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt;

== 1998 ==

The extended Winterval the following year included: [[Hallowe'en]]; [[Guy Fawkes Night]]; [[Diwali]]; [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]; [[Hanukkah]]; [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]; [[New Year's Eve]]; and [[Chinese New Year]].

Posters were displayed, advertising Christmas events, with the word "Christmas" in large type, and the "Winterval 98" logo only as a footnote.&lt;ref name="Pickles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2010/11/30/local-government-secretary-eric-pickles-attacks-1998-s-winterval-65233-27738640/|title=Local Government secretary Eric Pickles attacks 1998's Winterval|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=2010-11-30|publisher=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church of England]] leaders in Birmingham criticised the 1998 "Winterval" concept. [[Mark Santer]], then [[Bishop of Birmingham]], said in a message to his parishes that he "laughed out loud" when he learned of the concept of Winterval, which he considered to be "a way of not talking about Christmas" and "a well-meaning attempt not to offend". He wondered whether Christianity had been censored.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Winterval gets frosty reception |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Archdeacon]] of [[Aston]] called it "a totally unnecessary example of political correctness to avoid sensitivities people simply do not have".&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; The council responded that "Christmas is the very heart of Winterval", saying that Christmas-themed events were prominent among those included in Winterval, and that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; While the Winterval season was longer than the Christmas season, Christmas was the focus of the relevant portion of Winterval, and a statement from Birmingham Council explained:&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

{{quote|...there was a banner saying Merry Christmas across the front of the council house, Christmas lights, Christmas trees in the main civil squares, regular carol-singing sessions by school choirs, and the Lord Mayor sent a Christmas card with a traditional Christmas scene wishing everyone a Merry Christmas.}}

Neighbouring [[Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council|Solihull council]] invited Birmingham residents desiring a traditional Christmas to go there instead.&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Birmingham City Council did not use the name "Winterval" after the 1998–9 season,&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt; but it persists as shorthand for any secular replacement for Christmas, used both by supporters&lt;ref&gt;

The "Winterval" trope was also debunked by [[Stephen Fry]], in a 2007 episode of the quiz-show ''[[QI]]''.&lt;ref name= ""&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Empire |series=QI  |serieslink=QI |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRlZvn-KiH4 |accessdate=7 October 2017 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 7 December 2007  |season=E |number=12 |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer and law correspondent [[David Allen Green]], and the campaigner [[Inayat Bunglawala]] both included Winterval as an example in evidence to the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press.&lt;ref name="Allen Green"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen Green |first1=David |authorlink1=David Allen Green |title=Witness Statement of David Allen Green |url=http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-David-Allen-Green.pdf |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140122175531/http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-David-Allen-Green.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2014 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowater"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowater|first1=Donna|title=Leveson Inquiry: as it happened January 24|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9037670/Leveson-Inquiry-as-it-happened-January-24.html|accessdate=7 October 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green wrote:&lt;ref name="Allen Green" /&gt;

{{Quote|Within the "blogosphere" here are a number of highly regarded bloggers who specialise in exposing poor quality or misleading journalism... What happens is that a selected news story or column is subjected to scrutiny ("fact-checked") and the apparent basis for the story or column questioned. One excellent example of this is the destruction by bloggers of the Tabloid staple of "Winterval"...}}
