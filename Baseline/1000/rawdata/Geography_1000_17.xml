[[File:Compass Card B+W.svg|thumb|300px|A compass rose, showing absolute bearings in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.]]  
In nautical [[navigation]] the '''absolute bearing''' is the [[clockwise]] angle between [[north]] and an object observed from the vessel.  If the north used as reference is the true geographical [[true north|north]] then the bearing is a ''true bearing'' whereas if the reference used is [[magnetic north]] then the bearing is a ''magnetic bearing''. 

An absolute bearing is measured with a [[bearing compass]].

The measurement of absolute bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigation aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the [[nautical chart]] together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel.

'''Antichthones''', in [[geography]], are those peoples who inhabit the [[antipodes]], regions on opposite sides of the [[Earth]]. The word is compounded of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ὰντὶ'' ("opposed") and ''χθών'' ("earth").

[[Image:Climatic zones and antipodes.png|180px|right]]
[[Classical Europe|Classical]] and [[Medieval Europe]] considered the Earth to be divided by the [[equator]] into two [[Sphere|hemispheres]], the northern and southern; those who inhabited one of these hemispheres were said to be antichthones to those of the other. This idea was expounded by [[Pomponius Mela|Mela]] and other Classical authors, though Christian writers, who believed that all people on earth must be descended from Adam, denied the possibility that any southern land, if it existed, could be inhabited by humans. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], arguing from a position of scriptural [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], wrote in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' "it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man."&lt;ref name="CITYO'GOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dods |first1=Marcus (translator) |authorlink1=Philip Schaff |last2=St. Augustine |authorlink2=Augustine of Hippo |title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine |chapter=Book XVI, Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes. |volume=2 |editor1=Philip Schaff |work=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |year=1890 |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702022213/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archivedate=July 2, 2003 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The database contains official names and spellings of [[town]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and other geographic places. The database often has other useful information, such as the history of geographic names, and their use in history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12639">[[File:Beating the Bounds Oriel Oxford.jpg|thumb|Beating the bounds of the parish of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in Oxford.]]'''Beating the bounds''' is an ancient custom still observed in some [[England|English]] and [[Wales|Welsh]] [[parish]]es. Under the name of the '''Gangdays''' the custom of going a-ganging was kept before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:368.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of old and young members of the community would walk the boundaries of the parish, usually led by the parish priest and church officials, to share the knowledge of where they lay, and to pray for protection and blessings for the lands.

==Ceremony==
[[File:Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane - geograph.org.uk - 440810.jpg|thumb|Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane, Cambridge. The clergy and people of [[Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge|Little St Mary's Church]] annually walk round the boundaries of the parish, singing hymns and psalms and praying for blessings on the residents and their activities.]]
In former times when [[map]]s were rare&lt;ref&gt;The Ordnance Survey of the entire UK only began in the early 19th century and it was many years before the survey was complete.&lt;/ref&gt; it was usual to make a formal perambulation of the parish boundaries on [[Ascension Day]] or during [[Rogation days|Rogation week]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Knowledge of the limits of each parish needed to be handed down so that such matters as liability to contribute to the repair of the church, and the right to be buried within the churchyard were not disputed. The relevant jurisdiction was that of the [[ecclesiastical courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Tate, W. E.(1946) ''The Parish Chest''. Cambridge: Univ. Press; pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; The [[priest]] of the parish with the [[churchwarden]]s and the parochial officials headed a crowd of boys who, armed with green boughs, usually birch or willow, beat the parish [[boundary marker]]s with them. Sometimes the boys were themselves whipped or even violently bumped on the boundary-stones to make them remember. The object of taking boys along is supposed to ensure that witnesses to the boundaries should survive as long as possible.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Priests would pray for its protection in the forthcoming year and often Psalms 103 and 104 were recited, and the priest would say such sentences as "Cursed is he who transgresseth the bounds or doles of his neighbour".&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"&gt;Tate (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; Hymns would be sung, indeed a number of hymns are titled for their role, and many places in the English countryside bear names such as [[Gospel Oak]] testifying to their role in the beating of the bounds.

The ceremony had an important practical purpose. Checking the boundaries was a way of preventing encroachment by neighbours; sometimes boundary markers would be moved, or lines obscured, and a folk memory of the true extent of the parish was necessary to maintain integrity of borders by embedding knowledge in oral traditions. For a village man dwelling in champion country{{clarifyme|date=April 2016}}, under the traditional [[open field system]], George Homans remarks, "the bounds of his village were the most important bounds he knew."&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1991:368.&lt;/ref&gt; Village and parish were coterminous. The modern system of [[metes and bounds]] operates fundamentally similarly, giving a prose definition of a property as if walking about it.

At [[Manchester (ancient parish)|Manchester]] in 1597 [[John Dee]] recorded in his diary that he with the curate, the clerk and "diverse of the town of diverse ages" perambulated the bounds of the parish taking six days in all.&lt;ref&gt;Frangopulo, N. J. (1962) ''Rich Inheritance''. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Turnworth]] in Dorset the parish register records the perambulation for 1747 thus:&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"/&gt;
{{quote|1747. On Ascension Day after morning prayer at Turnworth Church, was made a public Perambulation of the bounds of the parish of Turnworth by me Richd. Cobbe, Vicar, Wm. Northover, Churchwarden, Henry Sillers and Richard Mullen, Overseers and others with 4 boys; beginning at the Church Hatch and cutting a great T on the most principal parts of the bounds. Whipping the boys by way of remembrance, and stopping their cry with some half-pence; we returned to church again, which Perambulation and Processioning had not been made for five years last past.}}

In a few cases such as the Corporation of the City of Portsmouth the bounds were on the shoreline and the route was followed by boat rather than on foot.&lt;ref name=gates66&gt;{{cite book |title=The Portsmouth that has Passed: With a Glimpse of Gosport |last=Gates |first=William G |editor1-first=Nigel |editor1-last=Peak  |year=1987 |publisher=Milestone Publications |isbn=1-85265-111-3 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice is still lawful and not affected by the limiting of the jurisdiction in 1860.{{clarification needed|date=May 2015|reason=How was what jurisdiction limited in 1860?}} Parish officers have the right to enter private property in carrying it out and also use the rates to cover expenses properly incurred (including refreshments, but not music, etc.). Perambulations must be at least three years apart.&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"/&gt;

==Origins==
In England, the custom dates from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] times, as it is mentioned in laws of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Athelstan of England|Æthelstan]]. It is thought that it may have been derived from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[Terminalia]]'', a festival celebrated on February 22 in honour of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god of [[landmark]]s, to whom cakes and wine were offered while sports and dancing took place at the boundaries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Similar practices, of [[pagan]] origin, were brought by the [[Norsemen]].&lt;ref name="Cholesbury"&gt;[http://www.cholesbury.com/beatbounds.htm ''Beating the Cholesbury Bounds'']. Retrieved August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In England, a [[parish ale]], a feast, was always held after the perambulation, which assured its popularity. In [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign the occasion had become an excuse for so much [[:wikt:revelry|revelry]] that it attracted the condemnation of a preacher who declared, "These solemne and accustomable processions and supplications be nowe growen into a right foule and detestable abuse."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Beating the bounds had a [[religion|religious]] aspect which is reflected in the [[rogation]], where the accompanying [[clergy]] beseech (''rogare'') the [[divinity|divine]] [[blessing]] upon the parish lands for the ensuing [[harvest]]. This feature originated in the 5th century, when [[Mamertus]], [[Archbishop of Vienne]], instituted special [[prayer]]s, [[fasting]] and  [[Religious procession|processions]] on these days. This clerical side of the parish bounds-beating was one of the religious functions prohibited by the Royal Injunctions of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1559; but it was then ordered that the perambulation should continue to be performed as a quasi-[[secular]] function, so that evidence of the boundaries of parishes, etc., might be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, ''Codex juris Ecclesiastici Anglicani'' (1761) pp. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bequest]]s were sometimes made in connection with bounds-beating. For example, at [[Leighton Buzzard]] on Rogation Monday, in accordance with the will of Edward Wilkes, a [[London]] merchant who died in 1646, the [[trustee]]s of his [[almshouse]]s accompanied the boys. The will was read and [[beer]] and plum rolls distributed. A remarkable feature of the bequest was that while the will is read one of the boys has to [[headstand|stand on his head]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Contemporary observations==

=== England ===
[[File:Millennium stone - geograph.org.uk - 607400.jpg|thumb|This stone commemorates a beating of the [[Marldon]] parish bounds in Devon in May 2000.]]
Although modern surveying techniques make the ceremony obsolete, at least for its secular purpose, many English parishes carry out a regular beating of the bounds, as a way of strengthening the community and giving it a sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html A Sense of Place - Common Ground website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415134830/http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html |date=2008-04-15 }}. Retrieved 06 04 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865–66 [[William Robert Hicks]] was mayor of [[Bodmin]] in Cornwall, when he revived the custom of beating the bounds of the town. This still takes place more or less every five years and concludes with a game of [[Cornish hurling]]. Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin and was last played in 2015.&lt;ref name=bodmin&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodmin Beating the Bounds &amp; Hurling|url=http://calendarcustoms.com/articles/bodmin-beating-the-bounds-hurling/|publisher=Calendar Customs|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is started by the mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the "Salting Pool". There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the "Salting Pool" via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a £10 reward from the Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005032340/http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 |date=2011-10-05 }}, ''Rotary Club of Bodmin'', 02/04/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The next occurrence of the Bodmin Hurl will follow the next beating of the bounds, in 2020.&lt;ref name=bodmin/&gt;

=== Massachusetts and New Hampshire ===

Perambulation of the town borders is a traditional duty of town boards of [[selectmen]] in the American states of [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="rsa"&gt;[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/51/51-2.htm ''TITLE III TOWNS, CITIES, VILLAGE DISTRICTS, AND UNINCORPORATED PLACES CHAPTER 51 TOWN LINES AND PERAMBULATION OF BOUNDARIES Section 51:2''] . Retrieved March 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Hampshire and Vermont ===

The laws of [[Vermont]] and New Hampshire require the attorneys general of those states to meet once every seven years to perambulate the boundary between the two states. They do not walk 275 miles along the Connecticut River, but they meet at the boundary and formally reaffirm their mutual understanding of the precise location of the boundary. The location had been disputed in the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Vermont v. New Hampshire]]'', decided in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/015/00611 Vermont Statutes, Title 1: Chapter 15: New Hampshire–Vermont Boundary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorneys General Delaney and Sorrell Will Meet on the Norwich/Hanover Bridge on May 14th for the Eleventh Perambulation of the NH/VT Boundary|url=https://www.doj.nh.gov/media-center/press-releases/2012/20120510-perambulation-boundary.htm|publisher=New Hampshire Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General|date=May 10, 2012|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Benchmark in Edinburgh.jpg|right|thumb|180px|An [[Ordnance Survey]] cut mark in the UK]]
[[File:Benchmark on rock near Llyn Crafnant.jpg|thumb|Occasionally a non-vertical face was used, and a slightly different mark was used]]

The term '''benchmark''', or '''bench mark''', originates from the chiseled horizontal marks that [[Surveying|surveyor]]s made in stone structures, into which an angle-iron could be placed to form a "bench" for a [[Level staff|leveling rod]], thus ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately repositioned in the same place in the future. These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled [[Broad arrow|arrow]] below the horizontal line.

The term is generally applied to any item used to mark a point as an elevation reference.  Frequently, bronze or aluminum disks are set in stone or concrete, or on rods driven deeply into the earth to provide a stable elevation point. If an elevation is marked on a map, but there is no physical mark on the ground, it is a [[spot height]].

The [[Height#In geodesy|height]] of a benchmark is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending from a ''fundamental benchmark''.  A fundamental benchmark is a point with a precisely known relationship to the level datum of the area, typically [[mean sea level]]. The position and height of each benchmark is shown on large-scale maps.

The terms "height" and "elevation" are often used interchangeably, but in many jurisdictions they have specific meanings; "height" commonly refers to a local or relative difference in the vertical (such as the height of a building), whereas "elevation" refers to the difference from a nominated reference surface (such as sea-level, or a mathematical/geodetic model that approximates the sea level known as the [[geoid]]).  Elevation may be specified as [[normal height]] (above a reference ellipsoid), [[orthometric height]], or [[dynamic height]] which have slightly different definitions.

== Other types of survey marks ==

[[Triangulation]] points, also known as [[trig point]]s, are marks with a precisely established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as the tip of a [[church (building)|church]] [[spire]] or a [[chimney stack]] are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the [[United Kingdom]] triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as "fixed in three dimensions".

==Agencies responsible for benchmarks==
Benchmarks are typically placed ("monumented") by a government agency or private survey firm, and many governments maintain a register of these marks so that the records are available to all. These records are usually in the form of a geographically searchable database (computer or map-based), with links to sketches, diagrams, photos of the marks, and any other technical details.

Government agencies that place and maintain records of benchmarks include:
* [[Canada]]
** [[Natural Resources Canada]] (Geodetic Survey Division)
* [[France]]
** [[Institut Géographique National]] ([[:fr:Institut géographique national|IGN on Wiki FR]]).
*[[India]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4835">The '''Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography''' was founded by the American [[geographer]] [[Carl O. Sauer]]. Sauer was a [[professor]] of [[geography]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] from 1923 until becoming professor [[emeritus]] in 1957 and was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate program at Berkeley and the discipline of [[geography]] in the [[United States]]. Each generation of this research school has pursued new theoretical and methodological approaches, but their study of the peoples and places of Latin America and the Caribbean has remained the common denominator since the early 20th century. Carl O. Sauer himself did not develop a particular interest in Latin America before 1925, when [[Oskar Schmieder]], a German geographer, disciple of [[Alfred Hettner]], and expert in Latin American regional geography, arrived at Berkeley, coming from Córdoba, Argentina, to work as an Associate Professor. Obviously, his interest awoke during Schmieder's presence between 1925 and 1930. After Schmieder's departure in 1930, Carl O. Sauer began to offer seminars on the regional geography of Latin America.

==First Generation==
Sauer graduated many doctoral students, the majority completing dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics and thereby founding the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography.&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. Brown and Kent Mathewson, "Sauer's Descent?, Or Berkeley Roots Forever?," ''APCG Yearbook'' 61 (1999): 137-57&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics are [[Fred Kniffen]] (1930), [[Peveril Meigs]] (1932), Donald Brand (1933), Henry Bruman (1940), Felix W. McBryde (1940), Robert Bowman (1941), {{Interlanguage link multi|Dan Stanislawski|nl}} (1944), [[Robert C. West (geographer)|Robert C. West]] (1946), [[James J. Parsons]] (1948), Edwin Doran (1953), Philip Wagner (1953), Brigham Arnold (1954), Homer Aschmann (1954), B. LeRoy Gordon (1954), Gordon Merrill (1957), Donald Innis (1958), Carl Johannessen (1959), Clinton Edwards (1962), and Leonard Sawatzky (1967).

==Second Generation==
Of Sauer's doctoral students, James J. Parsons became the most prolific in terms of directing Latin Americanist doctoral dissertations. He remained at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and produced many of the [[Ph.D.]]s in the second generation of the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography: Campbell Pennington (1959), [[William Denevan]] (1963), David Harris (1963), Thomas Veblen (1975), and [[Karl Zimmerer]] (1987).

==Third Generation==
One of the second generation, [[William Denevan]], became a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and, in turn, produced the majority of the third generation. Denevan's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American topics are, among others,  [[Daniel W. Gade]] (1967; co-chaired), [[Bernard Nietschmann]] (1970), Roger Byrne (1972), Roland Bergmann (1974), [[Billie Lee Turner II]] (1974), Stuart White (1981), Hildegardo Córdova (1982), Gregory Knapp (1984), [[Kent Mathewson]] (1987), John M. Treacy (1989), and Oliver Coomes (1992).

==Subsequent Generations==
A member of the fourth generation, [[William E. Doolittle]] studied with [[Billie Lee Turner II]], a prominent member of the third generation. Doolittle earned the [[Ph.D.]] in 1979, became a professor in the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]], and has extended the school into the fifth generation. Doolittle's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American topics are Dean P. Lambert (1992), [[Andrew Sluyter]] (1995), Emily H. Young (1995), Eric P. Perramond (1999), Phil L. Crossley  (1999), Jerry O. (Joby) Bass (2003), Maria G. Fadiman (2003), and Matthew Fry (2008).

Several of that fifth generation hold faculty positions in university departments with doctoral programs, and a sixth generation is now emerging. They are applying new approaches and research questions to the study of the peoples and places of Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf Kent Mathewson, "Sauer’s Berkeley School Legacy: Foundation for an Emergent Environmental Geography?,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172328/http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf |date=2012-04-15 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">[[File:UN prop marker.jpg|thumb|A property marker outside the [[United Nations]] building in New York City.]]
A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., &amp; Roe P. (1984) Reading the country: An introduction to nomadology. Fremantle, W.A.: Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying boundaries ==
[[File:Property line, crossing is by revocable license only.jpg|thumb|A private property line plaque separating the private property and the public [[right of way]] on a [[sidewalk]] in [[New York City]]. It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a [[prescriptive easement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Cora|last2=Randolph|first2=Mary|title=Neighbor law : fences, trees, boundaries, and noise|date=1994|publisher=Nolo Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780873372664|edition=2nd|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|chapter=Easements Acquired by Use of Property|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213516/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf#|archive-date=2015-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The &amp;#8522; symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6324">'''Chapman codes''' are a set of 3-letter codes used in genealogy to identify the administrative divisions in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. 

==Use==
They were created by the historian, Dr. Colin R Chapman, in the late 1970s, and as intended, provide a widely used [[shorthand]] in [[genealogy]] which follows the common practice of describing areas in terms of the counties existing in the 19th and 20th centuries. 

==Other uses==
Chapman codes have no mapping, postal or administrative use.  They can however be useful for disambiguation by postal services where a full county name or traditional abbreviation is not supplied after a place name which has more than one occurrence, a particular problem where these are [[post town]]s such as [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].

[[File:Dead-reckining.svg|right|thumb|200px|The navigator plots their 9am position, indicated by the triangle, and, using their course and speed, estimates their own position at 9:30am and 10am.]]

In [[navigation]], '''dead reckoning''' is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or [[Fix (position)|fix]], and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is [[path integration]].

[[File:Wind drift.png|thumbnail|Drift is the angle between the heading of the airplane and the desired track. A is the last known position (fix, usually shown with a circle). B is the air position (usually shown with a plus sign). C is the DR position (usually shown with a triangle).]]

Dead reckoning is subject to cumulative errors. Advances in [[navigational aid]]s that give accurate information on position, in particular [[satellite navigation]] using the [[Global Positioning System]], have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, [[inertial navigation system]]s, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied.

By analogy with their navigational use, the words ''dead reckoning'' are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities.

The term "dead reckoning" was not originally used to abbreviate "deduced reckoning," nor is it a misspelling of the term "ded reckoning."  The use of "ded" or "deduced reckoning" appeared much later in history, no earlier than 1931; in contrast to "dead reckoning" appearing as early as 1613 in the Oxford English Dictionary.  The original intention of "dead" in the term is not clear however.  Whether it is used to convey "absolute" as in "dead ahead," reckoning using other objects that are "dead in the water," or using reckoning properly "you’re dead if you don’t reckon right," is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is “dead reckoning” short for “deduced reckoning”?|url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2053/is-dead-reckoning-short-for-deduced-reckoning/|website = straightdope.com|accessdate = 2018-02-02|first = Cecil|last = Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Errors ==
Dead reckoning can give the best available information on position, but is subject to significant errors as both speed and direction must be accurately known at all instants for position to be determined accurately. For example, if displacement is measured by the number of rotations of a wheel, any discrepancy between the actual and assumed travelled distance per rotation, due perhaps to slippage or surface irregularities, will be a source of error. As each estimate of position is relative to the previous one, errors are [[Propagation of uncertainty|cumulative]], or compounding, multiplicatively or exponentially, if that is the co-relationship of the quanta.

The accuracy of dead reckoning can be increased significantly by using other, more reliable methods to get a new fix part way through the journey.  For example, if one was navigating on land in poor visibility, then dead reckoning could be used to get close enough to the known position of a landmark to be able to see it, before walking to the landmark itself — giving a precisely known start point — and then setting off again.

==Localization of mobile sensor nodes==
[[Location estimation in sensor networks|Localizing]] a static [[sensor node]] is not a difficult task because attaching a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device suffices the need of localization. But a [[mobile wireless sensor network|mobile sensor node]], which continuously change its geographical location with time is difficult to localize. Mostly mobile sensor nodes within some particular domain for data collection can be used, ''i.e'', sensor node attached to an animal within a grazing field or attached to a soldier on a battlefield. Within these scenarios a GPS device for each sensor node cannot be afforded. Some of the reasons for this include cost, size and battery drainage of constrained sensor nodes.
To overcome this problem a limited number of reference nodes (with GPS) within a field is employed. These nodes continuously broadcast their locations and other nodes in proximity receive these locations and calculate their position using some mathematical technique like [[trilateration]]. For localization, at least three known reference locations are necessary to localize. Several localization algorithms based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method have been proposed in literatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Localization for Mobile Sensor Networks|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1023720.1023726|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 10th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking|date = 2004-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-58113-868-7|pages = 45–57|series = MobiCom '04|doi = 10.1145/1023720.1023726|first = Lingxuan|last = Hu|first2 = David|last2 = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Monte Carlo Localization of Mobile Sensor Networks Using the Position Information of Neighbor Nodes|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04383-3_20|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2009-09-22|isbn = 978-3-642-04382-6|pages = 270–283|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-04383-3_20|first = Hamid|last = Mirebrahim|first2 = Mehdi|last2 = Dehghan|editor-first = Pedro M.|editor-last = Ruiz|editor-first2 = Jose Joaquin|editor-last2 = Garcia-Luna-Aceves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a node at some places receives only two known locations and hence it becomes impossible to localize. To overcome this problem, dead reckoning technique is used. With this technique a sensor node uses its previous calculated location for localization at later time intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Haroon Rashid, Ashok Kumar Turuk, 'Dead reckoning localisation technique for mobile wireless sensor networks', IET Wireless Sensor Systems, 2015, 5, (2), p. 87-96, DOI: 10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043
IET Digital Library, http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at time instant 1 if node A calculates its  position as ''loca_1'' with the help of three known reference locations; then at time instant 2 it uses ''loca_1'' along with two other reference locations received from other two reference nodes.  This not only localizes a node in less time but also localizes in positions where it is difficult to get three reference locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IET Digital Library: Dead reckoning localisation technique for mobile wireless sensor networks|url = http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043|website = digital-library.theiet.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01|first = Haroon|last = Turuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal navigation==

{{main|Animal navigation}}

In studies of [[animal navigation]], dead reckoning is more commonly (though not exclusively) known as [[path integration]]. Animals use it to estimate their current location based on their movements from their last known location. Animals such as ants, rodents, and geese have been shown to track their locations continuously relative to a starting point and to return to it, an important skill for foragers with a fixed home.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel. The Organization of Learning. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf Dead reckoning (path integration) requires the hippocampal formation: evidence from spontaneous exploration and spatial learning tasks in light (allothetic) and dark (idiothetic) tests, IQ Whishaw, DJ Hines, DG Wallace, Behavioural Brain Research 127 (2001) 49 – 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine navigation==
[[File:CYA Coastal Navigation With Dead Reckoning 2.jpg|thumb|Dead reckoning navigation tools in coastal navigation]]
In marine navigation a "dead" reckoning plot generally does not take into account the effect of [[Ocean current|current]]s or [[wind]]. Aboard ship a dead reckoning plot is considered important in evaluating position information and planning the movement of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/chapt07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313165051/http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/chapt07.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead reckoning begins with a known position, or [[Fix (position)|fix]], which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a [[chip log]]. More modern methods include [[pit log]] referencing engine speed (''e.g''. in [[revolutions per minute|rpm]]) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a [[pitot tube]]. This measurement is converted to an [[equivalent airspeed]] based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a [[pit sword]] (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can  then be adjusted resulting in an estimated  position by taking into account the current (known as [[set and drift]] in marine navigation). If there is  no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.

Dead reckoning positions are calculated at predetermined intervals, and are maintained between fixes. The duration of the interval varies. Factors including one's speed made good and the nature of heading and other course changes, and the navigator's judgment determine when dead reckoning positions are calculated.

Before the 18th-century development of the [[marine chronometer]] by [[John Harrison]] and the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]], dead reckoning was the primary method of determining [[longitude]] available to mariners such as [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[John Cabot]] on their trans-Atlantic voyages. Tools such as the [[traverse board]] were developed to enable even illiterate crew members to collect the data needed for dead reckoning. [[Polynesian navigation]], however, uses different [[wayfinding]] techniques.

== Air navigation ==
{{Main|Air navigation}}

[[File:RCAF DR Nav Tools 1940.JPG|thumb|British P10 Magnetic Compass with dead reckoning navigation tools]]
On May 21, 1927 [[Charles Lindbergh]] landed in [[Paris, France]] after a successful non-stop flight from the United States in the single-engined [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. This aircraft was equipped with very basic instruments. He used dead reckoning to find his way.

Dead reckoning in the air is similar to dead reckoning on the sea, but slightly more complicated. The density of the air the aircraft moves through affects its performance as well as winds, weight, and power settings.

The basic formula for DR is Distance = Speed x Time. An aircraft flying at 250 knots airspeed for 2 hours has flown 500 nautical miles through the air. The [[wind triangle]] is used to calculate the effects of wind on heading and airspeed to obtain a magnetic heading to steer and the speed over the ground (groundspeed). Printed tables, formulae, or an [[E6B]] flight computer are used to calculate the effects of air density on aircraft rate of climb, rate of fuel burn, and airspeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transport Canada TP13014E Sample Private Pilot Examination|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp13014-menu-5527.htm|publisher=Transport Canada|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A course line is drawn on the aeronautical chart along with estimated positions at fixed intervals (say every ½ hour). Visual observations of ground features are used to obtain fixes. By comparing the fix and the estimated position corrections are made to the aircraft's heading and groundspeed.

Dead reckoning is on the curriculum for VFR (visual flight rules - or basic level) pilots worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/de/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/111/icao_annex_1_personnellicensing.pdf.download.pdf/icao_annex_1_personnellicensing.pdf|title=ICAO Annex 1  Paragraph 2.3.4.2.1 h|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught regardless of whether the aircraft has navigation aids such as GPS, [[Automatic direction finder|ADF]] and [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] and is an [[ICAO]] Requirement. Many flying training schools will prevent a student from using electronic aids until they have mastered dead reckoning.

[[Inertial navigation system]]s (INSes), which are nearly universal on more advanced aircraft, use dead reckoning internally. The INS provides reliable navigation capability under virtually any conditions, without the need for external navigation references, although it is still prone to slight errors.

=={{anchor|ADR}}Automotive navigation==
{{main|Automatic vehicle location}}
Dead reckoning is today implemented in some high-end [[automotive navigation system]]s in order to overcome the limitations of [[GPS]]/[[GNSS]] technology alone. Satellite microwave signals are unavailable in [[parking garage]]s and tunnels, and often severely degraded in [[urban canyon]]s and near trees due to blocked lines of sight to the satellites or [[multipath propagation]]. In a dead-reckoning navigation system, the car is equipped with sensors that know the wheel circumference and record wheel rotations and steering direction. These sensors are often already present in cars for other purposes ([[anti-lock braking system]], [[electronic stability control]]) and can be read by the navigation system from the [[controller-area network]] bus. The navigation system then uses a [[Kalman filter]] to integrate the always-available sensor data with the accurate but occasionally unavailable position information from the satellite data into a combined position fix.

==Autonomous navigation in robotics==
Dead reckoning is utilized in some lower-end, non mission-critical, or tightly constrained by time or weight, robotic applications. It is usually used to reduce the need for sensing technology, such as [[ultrasonic sensor]]s, GPS, or placement of some [[linear encoder|linear]] and [[rotary encoder]]s, in an [[autonomous robot]], thus greatly reducing cost and complexity at the expense of performance and repeatability. The proper utilization of dead reckoning in this sense would be to supply a known percentage of electrical power or [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] pressure to the robot's drive motors over a given amount of time from a general starting point. Dead reckoning is not totally accurate, which can lead to errors in distance estimates ranging from a few millimeters (in [[Numerical control|CNC machining]]) to kilometers (in [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]]), based upon the duration of the run, the speed of the robot, the length of the run, and several other factors.

=={{anchor|PDR|UDR}}Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)==
With the increased sensor offering in [[smartphone]]s, built-in accelerometers can be used as a [[pedometer]] and built-in magnetometer as a compass heading provider. '''Pedestrian dead reckoning''' ('''PDR''') can be used to supplement other navigation methods in a similar way to automotive navigation, or to extend navigation into areas where other navigation systems are unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) Simplified|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQt5-LfqeZw|publisher=GT Silicon|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a simple implementation, the user holds their phone in front of them and each step causes position to move forward a fixed distance in the direction measured by the compass. Accuracy is limited by the sensor precision, magnetic disturbances inside structures, and unknown variables such as carrying position and stride length. Another challenge is differentiating walking from running, and recognizing movements like bicycling, climbing stairs, or riding an elevator.

Before phone-based systems existed, many custom PDR systems existed. While a [[pedometer]] can only be used to measure linear distance traveled, PDR systems have an embedded magnetometer for heading measurement. Custom PDR systems can take many forms including special boots, belts, and watches, where the variability of carrying position has been minimized to better utilize magnetometer heading. True dead reckoning is fairly complicated, as it is not only important to minimize basic drift, but also to handle different carrying scenarios and movements, as well as hardware differences across phone models.

==Directional dead reckoning==
{{main|South-pointing chariot}}
The south-pointing chariot was an ancient Chinese device consisting of a two-wheeled [[horse-drawn vehicle]] which carried a pointer that was intended always to aim to the south, no matter how the chariot turned. The chariot pre-dated the navigational use of the [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]], and could not ''detect'' the direction that was south. Instead it used a kind of '''directional dead reckoning''': at the start of a journey, the pointer was aimed southward by hand, using local knowledge or astronomical observations e.g. of the [[Pole Star]]. Then, as it traveled, a mechanism possibly containing [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears used the different rotational speeds of the two wheels to turn the pointer relative to the body of the chariot by the angle of turns made (subject to available mechanical accuracy), keeping the pointer aiming in its original direction, to the south. Errors, as always with dead reckoning, would accumulate as distance traveled increased.

== For networked games ==
Networked games and simulation tools routinely use dead reckoning to predict where an actor should be right now, using its last known kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity).&lt;ref name="Murphy2011"&gt;Murphy, Curtiss. ''Believable Dead Reckoning for Networked Games''. Published in Game Engine Gems 2, Lengyel, Eric. AK Peters, 2011, p 308-326.&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily needed because it is impractical to send network updates at the rate that most games run, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. The basic solution starts by projecting into the future using linear physics:&lt;ref&gt;Van Verth, James. ''Essential Mathematics for Games And Interactive Applications''. Second Edition. Morgan Kaufmann, 1971, p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
    P_t = P_0 + V_0T + \frac{1}{2}A_0T^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used to move the object until a new update is received over the network. At that point, the problem is that there are now two kinematic states: the currently estimated position and the just received, actual position. Resolving these two states in a believable way can be quite complex. One approach is to create a curve (ex cubic [[Bézier curve|Bézier splines]], [[centripetal Catmull–Rom spline]]s, and [[Cubic Hermite spline|Hermite curves]])&lt;ref&gt;Lengyel, Eric. ''Mathematics for 3D Game Programming And Computer Graphics''. Second Edition. Charles River Media, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; between the two states while still projecting into the future. Another technique is to use projective velocity blending, which is the blending of two projections (last known and current) where the current projection uses a blending between the last known and current velocity over a set time.&lt;ref name="Murphy2011"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    V_b = V_0 + \left (\acute{V}_0 - V_0 \right)\hat{T}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    P_t = P_0 + V_bT_t + \frac{1}{2}\acute{A}_0T_t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    \acute{P}_t = \acute{P}_0 + \acute{V}_0T_t + \frac{1}{2}\acute{A}_0T_t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    Pos = P_t + \left (\acute{P}_t - P_t \right)\hat{T} &lt;/math&gt;

==Computer science==
In computer science, dead-reckoning refers to navigating an [[array data structure]] using indexes. Since every array element has the same size, it is possible to [[Random access|directly access]] one array element by knowing any position in the array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.objectlayout.org | title=org.ObjectLayout, A layout-optimized Java data structure package | publisher=objectlayout.org | accessdate=19 October 2015 | author=Gil Tene and Martin Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the following array:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A || B || C || D || E
|}

knowing the memory address where the array starts, it is easy to compute the memory address of &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{address}_\text{D} = \text{address}_\text{start of array} + ( \text{size}_\text{array element} * \text{arrayIndex}_\text{D} )&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, knowing &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;'s memory address, it is easy to compute the memory address of &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{address}_\text{B} = \text{address}_\text{D} - ( \text{size}_\text{array element} * ( \text{arrayIndex}_\text{D} - \text{arrayIndex}_\text{B} ) )&lt;/math&gt;

This property is particularly important for [[Program optimization|performance]] when used in conjunction with arrays of [[Record (computer science)|structures]] because data can be directly accessed, without going through a [[Dereference operator|pointer dereference]].

'''Deformation monitoring''' (also referred to as '''deformation survey''') is the systematic measurement and tracking of the alteration in the shape or dimensions of an object as a result of [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es induced by applied loads. Deformation monitoring is a major component of logging measured values that may be used to for further computation, deformation analysis, [[predictive maintenance]] and alarming.&lt;ref&gt;Literature, Edited by J.F.A Moore (1992). ''Monitoring Building Structures''. Blackie and Son Ltd. {{ISBN|0-216-93141-X}}, USA and Canada {{ISBN|0-442-31333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deformation monitoring is primarily related to the field of applied [[surveying]], but may be also related to civil engineering, mechanical engineering, construction, and geology. The measuring devices used for deformation monitoring depend on the application, the chosen method, and the preferred measurement interval.

== Methods ==
Deformation monitoring can be manual or automatic. '''Manual deformation monitoring''' is the operation of sensors or instruments by hand or manual downloading of collected data from deformation monitoring instruments such as [[ShapeAccelArray]]. '''Automatic deformation monitoring''' operation of a group of software and hardware elements for deformation monitoring that, once set up, does not require human input to function.

Note that deformation analysis and interpretation of the data collected by the monitoring system is not included in this definition.

Automated deformation monitoring requires instruments to communicate with a base station. Communication methods used include:
*Transmission cable ([[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], [[fiber optics]])
*Local area network ([[Local area network|LAN]]) 
*Wireless LAN ([[Wireless LAN|WLAN]]) 
*Mobile communication ([[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[UMTS]])
*[[WiMax]]

== Regularity and scheduling ==

The monitoring regularity and time interval of the measurements must be considered depending on the application and object to be monitored. Objects can undergo both rapid, high frequency movement and slow, gradual movement. For example, a bridge might oscillates with a period of a few seconds due to the influence of traffic and wind and also be shifting gradually due to tectonic changes.

*'''Regularity''': ranges from a days, weeks or years for manual monitoring and continuous for automatic monitoring systems.
*'''Measurement interval''': ranges from fractions of a second to hours.

== Deformation analysis ==
Deformation analysis is concerned with determining if a measured displacement is significant enough to warrant a response. Deformation data must be checked for [[statistical significance]], and then checked against specified limits, and reviewed to see if movements below specified limits imply potential risks.

The software acquires data from sensors, computes meaningful values from the measurements, records results, and can notify responsible persons should threshold value be exceeded. However, a human operator must make considered decisions on the appropriate response to the movement, e.g. independent verification though on-site inspections, re-active controls such as structural repairs and emergency responses such as shut down processes, containment processes and site evacuation.

A '''high water mark''' is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a [[flood]], but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Weaver and Thomas J. Zembrzuski, Jr., "August 31, 1993, Storm Surge and Flood of Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island, North Carolina", in Charles A. Perry, L. J. Combs, ''Summary of floods in the United States, January 1992 through September 1993'' (1995), U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2499, p. 260, stating: Documentation of notable coastal floods provides scientists and flood-plain managers with useful data and technical information for an improved understanding of the hazard and for improved management of flood-prone areas. Of particular importance is documentation of the duration of flooding (and rates of rise and recession of floodwaters), maximum flood elevations and depths, and delineation of the extent of storm-surge flooding.&lt;/ref&gt; High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (2011), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level [[Information sign|sign]] or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy McTigue, James M. Symons, ''The Water Dictionary: A Comprehensive Reference of Water Terminology'' (2011), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining. A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a '''strandline''' and is typically composed of debris left by high tide. The area at the top of a [[beach]] where [[marine debris|debris]] is deposited is an example of this phenomenon. Where there are [[tide]]s, this line is formed by the highest position of the tide, and moves up and down the beach on a [[Tide#Analysis|fortnightly cycle]].&lt;ref name="Durham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.durhambiodiversity.org.uk/pdfs/habitats/Strandline.pdf |publisher=Durham Biodiversity Partnership |title=Strandline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris is chiefly composed of [[decomposition|rotting]] [[seaweed]], but can also include a large amount of [[litter]], either from [[ship]]s at sea or from [[sewage]] outflows.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |publisher=[[North Cornwall District Council]] |title=Strandlliines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018204101/http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological significance==
The strandline is an important [[habitat]] for a variety of [[animal]]s. In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], [[sandhopper]]s such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'' and the [[seaweed fly]] ''[[Coelopa frigida]]'' are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for [[wader|shore birds]] such as the [[Eurasian rock pipit|rock pipit]], [[turnstone]]&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt; and [[pied wagtail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theheritagecoast.co.uk/natural_world/ecology_of_portland_harbour/strand_line.htm |title=Strand Line |author=Gunnleyg Eldevig &amp; Andrew Flack |publisher=[[The Heritage Coast]] |work=Ecology of Portland Harbour}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mammal]]s such as [[European hare|brown hares]], [[red fox|foxes]], [[vole]]s and [[mouse|mice]].&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

==Legal significance==
One kind of high water mark is the '''ordinary high water mark''' or '''average high water mark''', the high water mark that can be expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high water mark may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate [[property law|property]] [[boundary (real estate)|boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinary high water mark has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the English Seas]], "the Admirals power extended even to the high water mark, and into the main streams".&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Bacon, ''The Continuation of an Historicall Discourse, of the Government of England until the end of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth'' (1651), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the high water mark is also significant because the [[United States Constitution]] gives Congress the authority to legislate for waterways, and the high water mark is used to determine the geographic extent of that authority. Federal regulations (33 CFR 328.3(e)) define the "ordinary high water mark" (OHWM) as "that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=2fcc86a0ae4919652ccaf4d67829679d&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=33:3.0.1.1.35&amp;idno=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of Section 404 of the [[Clean Water Act]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over non-tidal water bodies in the absence of adjacent wetlands. For the purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USACE 2005 OHWM Regulatory Guidance Letter|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/civilworks/RGLS/rgl05-05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OHWM is used by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and other federal agencies to determine the geographical extent of their regulatory programs. Likewise, many states use similar definitions of the OHWM for the purposes of their own regulatory programs.

In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that land below the OHWM (as defined by common law) along Lake Michigan is held by the state in trust for public use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Gunderson v. State of Indiana, Indiana Department of Natural Resources'', Court of Appeals of Indiana, Opinion 46A03-1508-PL-1116, December 7, 2016| url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/12071601msm.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the definition of the Mean High Water Mark is '...the line of the medium high tide between the highest tide of each
lunar month (the springs) and the lowest each lunar month (the Neaps) averaged over the year.' (http://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/tidal_interface/compendium_full_may03.pdf)

The '''International Geography Olympiad''' ('''iGeo''') is an annual competition for 16- to 19-year-old [[geography]] students from all over the world. Students chosen to represent their countries are some of the best, chosen from thousands of students who participate enthusiastically in their own National Geography Olympiads. iGeo tests the abilities of every participants in spatial patterns and processes. The iGeo consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and a substantial fieldwork exercise requiring observation, leading to cartographic representation and geographical analysis. The programme also includes poster presentations by teams, cultural exchanges, and time for students to get to know their fellow students and explore the host city.

The International Geography Olympiad is organised by the [[International Geographical Union]] (IGU) Olympiad Task Force, who produce tests with reference to the local organisers and the international board.

After the first iGeo in 1996, it was recommended that the competition was held biennially. Due to the competition growing in popularity, since 2012 the competition has been held annually, rather than biennially, as is the case with the other large [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

== History of competition and national success ==

During the 1994 Congress of the International Geographical Union (IGU) in [[Prague]], people from [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]] launched the idea of an International Geography Competition (iGeo) or Olympiad for students between 15 and 19 years of age. The first one was held in 1996 in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, with five participating countries. The participant count grew to 24 countries with the 2008 competition in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Before 2012, the International Science Olympiads were held every two years, and some regional geography Olympiads were held during intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoolympiad.org/fass/geoolympiad/what-is-igeo/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Asia Pacific Regional Geography Olympiads (APRGO), which were held in 2007 (Hsinchu, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;http://promotinggeog.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/iGeo2010taipei/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spock.nehs.hc.edu.tw/newsletter/1205/B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), 2009 (Tsukuba, Japan&lt;ref&gt;http://japan-igeo.com/english/pdf/result.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and 2011 (Merida, Mexico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtansw.org.au/files/geog_bulletin/2012/2_GTA%20Bulletin%201%202012-2_Asia%20Pacific%20Olympiad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Central European Regional Geography Olympiads (CERIGEO). Since 2013, the International Geography Olympiad, in concordance with the other Olympiads, has been held on a yearly basis.

At the most recent iGeo, held in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]] between July and August 2018, there were 43 participating countries.

The next Olympiad is the 2019 iGeo, which will be held in [[Hong Kong]], China in August 2019.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">The '''isoazimuth''' is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the points on the Earth's surface whose initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] with respect to a fixed point is constant.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, W. W.. 1943. “Azimuth Line of Position”. The American Mathematical Monthly 50 (8). Mathematical Association of America: 475–84. doi:10.2307/2304185. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2304185?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Accessed 2016-01-24].&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, if the initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] Z from the starting point ''S'' to the fixed point ''X'' is 80  [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], the associated isoazimuth is formed by all points whose initial [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic course]] with respect to point ''X'' is 80° (with respect to true north). The isoazimuth is written using the notation ''isoz(X, Z)''.

The isoazimuth is of use when [[navigation|navigating]] with respect to an object of known location, such as a radio beacon. A straight line called the ''azimuth line of position'' is drawn on a map, and on most common map projections this is a close enough approximation to the isoazimuth. On the [[Littrow projection]], the correspondence is exact. This line is then crossed with an astronomical observation called a [[Sumner line]], and the result gives an estimate of the navigator's position.

== Isoazimutal on the spherical Earth ==
Let '''X''' be a fixed point on the Earth of coordinates latitude: '''B2''', and longitude: '''L2'''. In a terrestrial spherical model, the equation of isoazimuth line of initial course '''C''' passing through point S('''B''', '''L''') is:
'''&lt;math&gt;tan(B2)*cos(B) = sin(B) * cos(L2-L)+sin(L2-L)/tan(C)\;&lt;/math&gt;'''

== Isoazimutal of a star ==
In this case the '''X''' point is the illuminating pole of the observed star, and the angle '''Z''' is its [[azimuth]]. The equation of the ''isoazimuthal'' &lt;ref&gt;Le segment capable sphérique. Navigation Nº.116 Vol.XXIX, Institut français de navigation, octubre/1981.&lt;/ref&gt;curve for a star with coordinates ('''Dec, Gha'''), -''Declination'' and ''Greenwich Hour Angle''-, observed under an azimuth '''Z''' is given by:
 
: '''&lt;math&gt;\cot(Z)/\cos(B) = \tan(Dec)/\sin(lha)-\tan(B)/\tan(lha)\;&lt;/math&gt;'''
where '''lha''' is the  local hour angle, and all points with '''latitude''' '''B''' and '''longitude''' '''L''', they define the curve.

'''Land''', sometimes referred to as '''dry land''', is the solid surface of [[Earth]] that is not permanently covered by [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Allaby, Chris Park, ''A Dictionary of Environment and Conservation'' (2013), p. 239, {{ISBN|0199641668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support [[agriculture]], [[habitat]], and various [[natural resource]]s. Some life forms (including [[terrestrial plant]]s and [[terrestrial animal]]s) have developed from predecessor species that lived in [[body of water|bodies of water]].

Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called [[coast|coastal zones]]. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A [[maritime boundary]] is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock [[landform]]s are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.

== Etymology and terminology ==
{{original research section|date=March 2018}}
{{refimprovesect|date=March 2018}}

The word 'land' is derived from Middle English ''land'', ''lond'' and [[Old English]] ''land'', ''lond'' (“earth, land, soil, ground; defined piece of land, territory, realm, province, district; landed property; country (not town); ridge in a ploughed field”), from Proto-Germanic ''*landą'' (“land”), and from Proto-Indo-European ''*lendʰ-'' (“land, heath”). Cognate with Scots ''land'' (“land”), West Frisian ''lân'' (“land”), Dutch ''land'' (“land”), German ''Land'' (“land, country, state”), Swedish ''land'' (“land, country, shore, territory”), Icelandic ''land'' (“land”). Non-Germanic cognates include Old Irish ''lann'' (“heath”), Welsh ''llan'' (“enclosure”), Breton ''lann'' (“heath”), Old Church Slavonic ''lędо'' from Proto-Slavic ''*lenda'' (“heath, wasteland”) and Albanian ''lëndinë'' (“heath, grassland”) from ''lëndë'' (“matter, substance”).

A continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a "landmass". Although it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage "[[Land#Land mass|land mass]]"—the measure of land area—it is also used as two words. Landmasses include [[supercontinent]]s, [[continent]]s, and [[island]]s. There are four major continuous landmasses on [[Earth]]: [[Afro-Eurasia]], the [[Americas]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. Land, capable of being [[plough]]ed and used to grow [[crop]]s, is called [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} "arable, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A country or region may be referred to as the [[Homeland#Motherland|motherland]], [[fatherland]], or [[homeland]] of its people. Many countries and other places have names incorporating [[-land]] (e.g. [[New Zealand]]).

&lt;/ref&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] bodies occurred in tandem with the Sun. In theory, a [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Formation of the planets|solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disc]], which the planets then grow out of in tandem with the star. A nebula contains gas, ice grains and [[cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). In [[nebular hypothesis|nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s commence forming as [[Granular material#Granular gases|particulate]] matter accrues by [[cohesion (geology)|cohesive clumping]] and then by gravity.

== Land mass ==
{{Redirect|Landmass|the ambient album by Steve Roach|Landmass (album)}}
"Land mass" refers to the total [[surface area|surface]] [[area]] of the land of a geographical [[region]] or [[country]] (which may include discontinuous pieces of land such as [[island]]s). It is written as two words to distinguish it from the usage "landmass", the contiguous area of land surrounded by [[ocean]]. [[Earth]]'s total land mass is approximately {{convert|148,939,063.133|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is about 29.2% of its total surface. Water covers approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly in the form of [[ocean]]s and ice formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oceanicinstitute.org/aboutoceans/aquafacts.html|title=Aqua Facts|publisher=Hawai'i Pacific University Oceanic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural perspectives==
{{main article|Earth in culture}}
[[Creation myth]]s in many [[religion]]s recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural [[deity]] or deities, including accounts wherein the land is separated from the oceans and the air. The Earth itself has often been personified as a [[deity]], in particular a [[goddess]]. In many cultures, the [[mother goddess]] is also portrayed as a [[Fertility god|fertility deity]]. To the [[Aztec]]s, Earth was called ''[[Tonantzin]]''—"our mother"; to the [[Incas]], Earth was called ''[[Pachamama]]''—"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess [[Hou Tu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E.T.C. | last=Werner | year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. [[Bhumi Devi|Bhuma Devi]] is the goddess of Earth in [[Hinduism]], influenced by [[Graha]]. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth giantess [[Jörð]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]]. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian mythology]] is different from that of other cultures because Earth ([[Geb]]) is male and sky ([[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]) is female.

In the past, there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]]. The Jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one another. "Cosmology." Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012. Author: Giorgio Abetti, Astrophysical Observatory of Arcetri-Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Earth is usually described as a disk encircled by water. Cosmological and metaphysical speculations were not to be cultivated in public nor were they to be committed to writing. Rather, they were considered to be "secrets of the Torah not to be passed on to all and sundry" (Ketubot 112a). While study of God's creation was not prohibited, speculations about "what is above, what is beneath, what is before, and what is after" (Mishnah Hagigah: 2) were restricted to the intellectual elite. (Topic Overview: Judaism, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Ed. J. Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference, 2003. pp. 477–483. Hava Tirosh-Samuelson).&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}[[Image:Baylonianmaps.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Babylonian Map of the World|Imago Mundi]]'' Babylonian map, the oldest known world map, 6th century BC [[Babylonia]].]]

In early Egyptian&lt;ref&gt;H. and H.A. Frankfort, J.A. Wilson, and T. Jacobsen, Before Philosophy (Baltimore: Penguin, 1949) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian thought]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean. The Egyptian universe was pictured as a rectangular box with a north-south orientation and with a slightly concave surface, with Egypt in the center. A similar model is found in the [[Homeric]] account of the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods."&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Pyramid Texts]] and [[Coffin Texts]] reveal that the ancient Egyptians believed [[Nu (mythology)|Nun]] (the ocean) was a circular body surrounding ''nbwt'' (a term meaning "dry lands" or "islands"), and therefore believed in a similar Ancient Near Eastern circular Earth cosmography surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;''Pyramid Texts'', Utterance 366, 629a–629c: "Behold, thou art great and round like the Great Round; Behold, thou are bent around, and art round like the Circle which encircles the nbwt; Behold, thou art round and great like the Great Circle which sets."''(Faulkner 1969, 120)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', Pritchard, 1969, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Coffin Texts'', Spell 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early [[Greek philosophers]], a belief espoused by [[Pythagoras]]. Contrary to popular belief, most people in the [[Middle Ages]] did not believe the Earth was flat: this misconception is often called the "[[Myth of the Flat Earth]]". As evidenced by thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], the European belief in a [[spherical Earth]] was widespread by this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Jeffrey B. | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | title = The Myth of the Flat Earth | publisher = American Scientific Affiliation | accessdate = 2007-03-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EnVfVa?url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}; but see also [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to circumnavigation of the planet and the introduction of [[space flight]], belief in a spherical Earth was based on observations of the secondary effects of the Earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Extraterrestrial land==
Most planets known to humans are either gaseous [[Jovian planets]] or solid [[terrestrial planets]]. Terrestrial planets include [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Solar System Exploration [https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 Terrestrial Planet Interiors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105322/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian planets consist of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. While these planets are larger, their only land surface is a small rocky core surrounded by a large, thick atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf The Jovian Planets] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YLhNKGil?url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf |date=2015-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gas giant]]s, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to have surface layers composed of [[liquid hydrogen]] rather than solid land; however, their [[planetary geology]] is not well understood. The possibility of Uranus and Neptune (the [[ice giant]]s) possessing hot, highly compressed, supercritical water&lt;!-- {{efn|name=pressures}} --&gt; under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised.  While their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz et al. ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune,&lt;ref name="WiktorowiczIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiktorowicz|first1=Sloane J.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Andrew P.|title=Liquid water oceans in ice giants|journal=Icarus|volume=186|issue=2|year=2007|pages=436–447|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.09.003|arxiv = astro-ph/0609723 |bibcode = 2007Icar..186..436W }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.&lt;ref name="Silvera2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silvera|first1=Isaac|title=Diamond: Molten under pressure|journal=Nature Physics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2010|pages=9–10|issn=1745-2473|doi=10.1038/nphys1491|bibcode = 2010NatPh...6....9S |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:9121282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire surface of a rocky planet or moon is considered land, even with a lack of seas or oceans for contrast. Planetary bodies that have a thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode rough impact sites.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/how-are-craters-formed/ How are craters formed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114424/http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/how-are-craters-formed/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land on planetary bodies other than Earth can also be bought and sold although ownership of [[extraterrestrial real estate]] is not recognized by any authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunarembassy.com|title=Lunar Embassy|work=lunarembassy.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407193257/http://lunarembassy.com/|archivedate=2015-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land and climate==
The land of the Earth interacts with and influences [[climate]] heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media"&gt;PBS Learning Media [http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ The Effect of Land Masses on Climate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092309/http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latitude]], [[elevation]], [[topography]], [[reflectivity]], and [[land use]] all have varying effects. The latitude of the land will influence how much [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface. High latitudes receive less solar radiation than low latitudes.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; The height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and [[precipitation]] on Earth. Large landforms, such as mountain ranges, divert wind energy and make the air parcel less dense and able to hold less heat.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; As air rises, this cooling effect causes [[condensation]] and [[precipitation]]. Reflectivity of the earth is called planetary [[albedo]] and the type of land cover that receives energy from the sun affects the amount of energy that is reflected or transferred to Earth.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"&gt;Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research [http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth/ The Climate Energy Balance of the Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305041546/http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth |date=2015-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vegetation]] has a relatively low albedo meaning that vegetated surfaces are good absorbers of the sun’s energy. [[Forests]] have an albedo of 10–15% while [[grasslands]] have an albedo of 15–20%. In comparison, sandy [[deserts]] have an albedo of 25–40%.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"/&gt; Land use by humans also plays a role in the regional and global climate. Densely populated cities are warmer and create [[urban heat islands]] that have effects on the precipitation, cloud cover, and temperature of the region.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt;

Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

But {{sic}} we don't want free electricity, we want to buy it. Just by selling electricity to India, Nepal can find a place in the developed countries of the world."

|Modi visited Japan on a five-day official trip from 30 August to 3 September, which is labelled as his first bilateral state visit outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]]. His 2014 visit further strengthened the ties between the two countries, and resulted in several key agreements, including the elevating of the already established strategic partnership to the "Special Strategic Global Partnership". During his visit, official negotiations on the sale of [[US 2]] amphibious aircraft for the Indian Navy and the long pending civil nuclear agreements have both progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/indias-modi-maintains-warm-ties-with-japans-abe/article20336839/|title=India’s Modi maintains warm ties with Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe |author=Iain Marlow |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-02/news/53479980_1_shinzo-abe-strategic-global-partnership-japan |title=India, Japan sign key agreements; to share 'Special Strategic Global Partnership' |date=2 September 2014 |newspaper = Economic Times |author=Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Modi delivered his maiden speech in the [[sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] on 27 September 2014, in which he called for the reform and expansion of the [[United Nations Security Council]], most notably bringing attention to India's long standing demand of a permanent membership. He expressed his concerns over the relevance of a 20th century setup in the 21st century, and stressed the need to evaluate the UN's performance in the past 70 years. He also questioned why the UN should serve as the G-All for global governance, instead of several parallel sub-groupings like the [[G7]] or [[G20]]. In the wake of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] threat in West Asia and other similar threats in other parts of the world, Modi urged for the immediate implementation of the 'Comprehensive on International Terrorism' by the UN and offered India's pro-active role in it, citing India as a victim of terrorism for decades. Prior to his speech, he, along with External Affairs Minister [[Sushma Swaraj]], met with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], to discuss issues relating to UN governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-at-unga-lets-work-towards-a-sustainable-world-move-towards-g-all/articleshow/43642407.cms|title=PM Modi at UNGA: Let's work towards a sustainable world; move towards G-All|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also ridiculed the possibility of any multilateral intervention on the issue of Kashmir, a demand [[Nawaz Sharif]] made in his address at the UNGA on 26 September, stating that the Indian government is ready for 'bilateral talk' with Pakistan provided that Pakistan cultivate a suitable environment for talks by giving up its terrorism policy against India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/prime-minister-narendra-modi-s-address-to-un-general-assembly-in-10-points-598833?pfrom=home-lateststories|title=Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Address to UN General Assembly in 10 Points|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi commented briefly on climate change and the use of clean energy. In this regard, he also asked world leaders and UN officials to recognise and observe '''Yoga Day''',  in order to emphasise the importance of incorporating [[Yoga]] into a modern-day lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-asks-world-leaders-to-adopt-international-yoga-day/articleshow/43646752.cms|title=PM Modi asks world leaders to adopt International Yoga Day|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also was known for fasting during a [[White House]] dinner for the Hindu festival of [[Navratri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2014/0929/What-s-a-White-House-dinner-without-dinner-Modi-and-Obama-will-find-out.-video |title=What's a White House dinner without dinner?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27816">{{see also|Daylight saving time by country}}
This is a list representing '''[[time zone]]s by country'''. Countries are ranked by total number of time zones on their territory. Time zones of a country include that of [[dependent territories]] (except [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|Antarctic claims]]). [[France]], including its overseas territories, has the most time zones with 13. Many countries have [[daylight saving time]], one added hour during the local summer, but this list does not include that information. The [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] offset in the list is not valid in practice during daylight saving time.

'''Mainland''' is a [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] [[landmass]] that is larger and often [[human geography|politically, economically and/or demographically]] more significant than [[political geography|politically associated]] [[Outlying territory|remote territories]], such as [[exclaves]] or [[oceanic islands]] situated outside the [[continental shelf]]. 

In geography, "mainland" can denote the [[continent]]al (i.e. non-insular) part of any [[polity]] or the main island within an [[island nation]]. In [[geopolitics]], "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like [[Metropolis#Metropolis as a mainland area|Metropole]] as an antonym to [[overseas territories]]. In the sense of "[[wikt:heartland|heartland]]", mainland is the opposite of [[wikt:periphery|periphery]].

The term is relative- in [[Tasmania]], continental [[Australia]] is the mainland, while to residents of [[Flinders Island]], the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland".

The site was a collaboration between [[Microsoft Research]] (MSR), [[Bing Maps]], and the USGS. It had been in operation since June 1998. It had 30,000 to 50,000 visitors per day as of January 2010. The site was renamed in 2010, prior to which it had been known as '''TerraServer-USA'''&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/About.aspx?n=AboutWhatsNew&amp;b=Newsite New Web Site Name] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209194823/http://msrmaps.com/About.aspx?n=AboutWhatsNew&amp;b=Newsite |date=2010-02-09 }}. Microsoft Research Maps. January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly '''Microsoft TerraServer''').

The site had black and white USGS aerial photographs of approximately 97% of the [[United States]].

== History ==
Though it was online as early as December 1997, the site was formally unveiled June 24, 1998, as part of an 18-month agreement between [[Microsoft]], [[Compaq]], and [[Aerial Images]] of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  It was created as a demonstration system to advertise the scalability of Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] Server and [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], and used images from the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[Sovinformsputnik]] (the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]]).

TerraServer was the brainchild of the Turing Award-winning researcher on database systems, [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]].  Before his death, Gray continued this work, developing [[Microsoft Virtual Earth]] and began a similar project that would become the [[Worldwide Telescope]].

In January 2000, Microsoft and Aerial Images, now TerraServer.com, Inc., split their operations, creating two parallel TerraServer websites.  The dualism caused confusion among web surfers until the Microsoft name change in 2010.  TerraServer.com, Inc., which owns the trademark&lt;ref name="trademark"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76534179 |title=USPTO Trademark Status |access-date=2010-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081834/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76534179 |archive-date=2011-06-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TERRASERVER, filed a lawsuit&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;"[https://www.pcworld.com/article/145613/microsoft_satellite_map_project_sued_over_name.html Microsoft Satellite Map Project Sued Over Name]". ''PC World''. May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 in North Carolina federal court, seeking monetary damages and asking that Microsoft be stopped from using the TerraServer trademark.

The TerraServer name was a play on words, with 'Terra' referring to the 'earth' or 'land' and also to the terabytes of images stored on the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">'''NavPix''' is the proprietary name applied by [[Navman]] to its technology that combines an image with geographical data.

The "NavPix" name is used for both the software and the geo-referenced image that results from that software.

==NavPix software==
The NavPix technology enables users to take a [[JPEG]] image using the integrated digital camera on the N Series ("N" for NavPix), iCN 720 or iCN 750 portable Navman GPS navigation devices.

The Navman's GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]) receiver determines the latitude and longitude of where that image was taken. That information is then written into the image's Exif ([[Exchangeable image file format]]) meta data by the '''NavPix software'''. The NavPix, therefore, effectively provides a [[Georeference]] of the location where the image was taken, which is not necessarily the same georeference as the object being "NavPix-ed".

The NavPix image can then be used to define a destination or [[point of interest]] on compatible Navman devices.

==NavPix sources==
Furthermore, as the geographical information is written to the meta data, the image itself can be shared between compatible devices or uploaded to Navman's NavPix Library which offers a wide range of NavPix images that have been taken by both Navman users and sourced from professional photo providers, including [[Lonely Planet]].

The NavPix Library also enables people to upload non-NavPix images (including other formats such as [[GIF]]) and convert them to NavPix images by using entering either the latitude and longitude they want to associate with the image or by entering the address and using the Library's software to generate the latitude and longitude values based on a [[Postal code]] look-up.

Unlike some geo-referencing applications, the NavPix Library writes the georeference values to the image itself via the [[Exif]] meta data.

==Common Misconceptions==
The photo taking abilities do not help navigation.

[[Image:John Rodgers.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]]]]
The '''North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition''', also known as the '''Rodgers-Ringgold Expedition''' was a United States scientific and exploring project from 1853 to 1856. 

Commander [[Cadwalader Ringgold]] (1802&amp;ndash;1867) led the expedition until he was relieved of command in [[Hong Kong]] by a commission convened by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]]. Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] (1812&amp;ndash;1882) then commanded the expedition until its conclusion.

==The expedition under Ringgold==
[[Image:Commodore Cadwalader Ringgold.jpg|thumb|left|upright |[[Cadwalader Ringgold]] ]]
Ringgold sailed on [[USS Porpoise (1836)|USS ''Porpoise'']], a ship he had commanded during the [[U.S. Exploring Expedition]] years before. [[USS John Hancock (1850)|USS ''John Hancock'']], commanded by Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] and three other vessels including [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes'']] would be the other vessels in the expedition.

''Porpoise'' joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea 11 June 1853. After stopping at [[Funchal]], [[Madeira Islands]]; [[Porto Praya]]; and [[Simonstown]], [[False Bay]]; the expedition arrived [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Java (island)|Java]], 12 December and in [[China]] in March 1854. 

Five months were devoted to surveying the waters surrounding the large islands off the coast of Southeast Asia. Early in May 1854, ''John Hancock'', with Rodgers commanding, departed for [[Hong Kong]], where she arrived 24 May. The squadron operated from that port as its base throughout the summer, surveying nearby coasts, islands and rivers. At this time [[China]] was plagued by rebellion and [[pirate]]s endangering foreigners and threatening their property. The American ships helped protect American citizens and interests. While steaming up the [[Pearl River (China)|Canton River]], two armed boats from ''John Hancock'' were fired upon by rebel batteries, which ''Hancock'''s cannon promptly silenced.

==From Hong Kong to the United States==
[[Image:USS Porpoise (1836).jpg|thumb|right|[[USS Porpoise (1836)|USS Porpoise]]]]

In July 1854, Ringgold became sick with malaria and was sent home, according to at least one source.&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FvPM4s2QZ207lH0LK4PgT4g5LlKhs6gCQ1xQ1GqhpZC1lPQMQKQR!15464514?a=o&amp;d=5002380544 Questia.com] Questia Online Library Web site copy of: Houston, Alan Fraser, "Cadwalader Ringgold, U. S. Navy" an article in ''California History'' magazine, Volume 79, Issue 4, Winter 2000, page 208, Web site accessed October 19, 2006, Footnote 11&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book "Sea of Glory" about the U.S. Exploring Expedition, writes that in the later expedition Ringgold "began to act strangely" once in China, keeping his ships in port "ceaselessly repairing his vessels". Commodore Perry, on his own expedition, sailed in and convened an official panel which relieved Ringgold from command of the expedition and sent him home. Philbrick quotes Perry as declaring Ringgold "insane."&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''Sea of Glory: America's voyage of discovery, The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842'' (Viking: 2003), {{ISBN|0-670-03231-X}} pages 351,-352&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] was given full command of the expedition and completed it.

The squadron headed north along the coast as far as the [[Bering Sea]], surveying as it went.
The squadron at that time also explored islands well off the coast of Asia, including the [[Bonins]], the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]], and the [[Marianas]]. ''Porpoise'' parted company with the other vessels 21 September 1854 between [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and China, and was never heard from again. It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron.

At the Bering sea, the expedition turned south along the western coast of North America. In March 1856, the expedition arrived at [[Puget Sound]] to help suppress Indian uprisings which threatened to wipe out white settlements and Army outposts established in the early 1850s.

==Results of the expedition==
Besides greatly increasing knowledge of the western and northern Pacific, stimulating commerce, and easing navigation in previously unknown seas, the expedition has been credited with helping to establish friendly relations between the United States and several nations of East Asia.

'''Orienteering''' is a group of [[sport]]s that requires [[navigation]]al skills using a [[map]] and [[compass]] to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared [[orienteering map]], which they use to find [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a training exercise in [[Land navigation (military)|land navigation for military officers]], orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is [[foot orienteering]].  For the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but almost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a map is a type of orienteering.

&lt;!-- expand this paragraph and/or consider segregating info by sport (foot-O, mtb-O, etc) --&gt;
Orienteering is included in the programs of world sporting events including the [[World Games]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Orienteering sports==
Orienteering sports combine significant [[navigation]] with a specific method of travel.  Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and [[Course (orienteering)|course]] design.

[[International Orienteering Federation]], the governing body of the sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering:
* [[Foot orienteering]] (FootO)
* [[Mountain bike orienteering]] (MTBO)
* [[Ski orienteering]] (SkiO)
* [[Trail orienteering]] (TrailO)

Moreover, [[International Amateur Radio Union]] (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport:
* [[Amateur radio direction finding]] (Radio orienteering or ARDF) [including variants [[Fox Oring]] and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA)]

Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to:
* [[Canoe orienteering]]
* [[Car orienteering]]
* [[Mountain marathon]]ing
* [[Mounted orienteering]]
* [[Rogaining]]
* SportLabyrinth – micro orienteering

[[Adventure racing]] is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the [[Racing|race]].

===National===
&lt;!--Country/nation. Note UK is one nation comprising four countries--&gt;
{{See also|Category:International Orienteering Federation members|l1=International Orienteering Federation members}}

There are governing bodies for most of the individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-making body for that nation. For example, the [[British Orienteering Federation]] is the national governing body for the [[United Kingdom]]. The federation was founded in 1967 and it is made up of 13 constituent associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|title=About British Orienteering|accessdate=2008-05-25|publisher=British Orienteering Federation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105559/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|archivedate=2008-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[United States]], the national governing body is [[Orienteering USA]].

===Regional===
Most nations have some form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-making bodies but are there to assist in coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may allocate dates so that clubs do not clash with their events.

===Local===
{{See also|Category:Orienteering clubs|l1=Orienteering clubs}}
Clubs are usually formed at a local level and affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put on events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events.
Open clubs are open to anyone and there is usually no restriction on joining them.
Closed clubs restrict their membership to specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baoc.org.uk/ |title= BAOC Online |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=baoc.org.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has restrictions on who may join, principally British Army personnel.

==History==
{{main|History of orienteering}}

The history of orienteering begins in the late 19th century in [[Sweden]], the actual term "orientering" (the original Swedish name for orienteering, lit. "orientation") was first used in 1886 and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/iof/past_present|title=Past &amp; present|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802131200/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fiof%2Fpast_present|archivedate=2008-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, orienteering grew from [[Military education and training|military training]] in [[land navigation (military)|land navigation]] into a competitive sport for military officers, then for civilians. The name is derived from a word root meaning to find the direction or location. The first orienteering competition open to the public was held in [[Norway]] in 1897.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;

From the beginning, locations selected for orienteering have been chosen in part for their beauty, natural or man-made. For the first public orienteering competition in Sweden, in 1901, control points included two historic churches, [[Spånga Church|Spånga kyrka]] and [[Bromma Church|Bromma kyrka]] (a [[round church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |title=Milstolpar i utvecklingen |publisher=Svenska Orienteringsförbundet |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233231/http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Orienteering Championships 2007 - middle distance 04.jpg|thumb|right|World Orienteering Championships 2007 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Winners of middle-distance event: [[Simone Niggli-Luder]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Thierry Gueorgiou]], [[France]]]]
With the invention of inexpensive yet reliable compasses, the sport gained popularity during the 1930s. By 1934, over a quarter million Swedes were participants, and orienteering had spread to [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Hungary]]. Following [[World War II]], orienteering spread throughout Europe and to Asia, North America and Oceania. In Sweden in 1959, an international orienteering conference was held. Representatives from 12 countries ([[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], [[Hungary]], Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, [[Yugoslavia]]) participated.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;  In 1961, orienteering organizations representing 10 European nations&lt;!-- 10 national federations? --&gt; founded the [[International Orienteering Federation]] (IOF). Since then, IOF has supported the founding of many national orienteering federations. By 2010, 71 national orienteering federations were member societies of the [[International Orienteering Federation]].&lt;ref name=iof_nations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006|title=National Federations|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2006-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227191403/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006|archive-date=2006-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These federations enabled the development of national and world championships. World championships were held every two years until 2003, then every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|title=Orienteering: A Brief History|publisher=Orienteering Australia|accessdate=2008-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230326/http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|archivedate=2008-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this time, orienteering has remained most popular in [[Scandinavia]]. There, the two oldest recurring orienteering meets have been held since the 1940s ([[Jukola relay]] and [[Tiomila]]), and the single largest orienteering meet has been held every year since 1965 and attracts around 15,000 competitors ([[O-Ringen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/The+Jukola+Relay+is+about+much+more+than+orienteering+/1135228145846|title=The Jukola Relay is about much more than orienteering|last=Pulkkinen|first=Sanna|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, orienteering is run in wild terrain. In its Scandinavian origins, this typically meant in the [[forest]], but orienteering in open [[fell]], [[heathland]], [[moorland]] and other mixed terrain is also common. Orienteering in [[town]]s has been common for many years. Street-O has typically been a low-key affair; score events, often at night, normally as informal training events. The [[Venice]] street-O is notable for attracting a large international participation. With Park World Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwt.org|title=Park World Tour|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; races and other (e.g. World championships) elite sprint races often being held in urban areas, and the development of a map specification for urban areas (ISSOM), from the mid-2000s, Street-O has been rebranded as urban orienteering, and has taken itself rather more seriously, with full colour maps and electronic punching, and may now be regarded as a serious competition with inclusion in national ranking lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/page/rankings|title=British Orienteering Rankings|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such urban races are often much longer than the sprint distance.

==Competition and results==
===Basics===
[[File:Tajfuto.jpg|thumb|left|An orienteer at a control point]]

The competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational skill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High levels of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and running speed are required to compete successfully at an international or elite level. To ensure fairness between competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normally staggered with competitors starting at not less than one-minute intervals.&lt;ref name=nutshell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |title=Your first orienteering event |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=orienteer.com |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084924/http://www.orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |archive-date=2008-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective on each leg is to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on [[Route choice (orienteering)|route choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224192329/http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-02-24|title=Foot Orienteering|publisher=[[Orienteering Queensland]]|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map===
[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005.PNG|thumb|left|An orienteering map]]
Orienteering competitions use specially prepared [[orienteering map]]s. They are topographic maps although much more detailed than general-purpose maps. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000 or 1:10,000, with grids aligned to [[Magnetic declination|magnetic]] [[north]]. Map symbols are standardized by the IOF,&lt;ref name=iof-map-2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000.pdf |format=PDF|title=International Specification for Orienteering Maps|accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed to be readable by any competitor regardless of background or native tongue.

===Courses===
[[File:Orienteering map control points.svg|thumb|right|An example of how control points are shown on an orienteering map]]
Orienteering events offer a range of courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering [[course (orienteering)|course]] is marked in purple or red on a map.&lt;ref name=themap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/Biology/Faculty_Staff/hwilliams/Orienteering/map.html |title=The Map |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=www.williams.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[triangle]] is used to indicate the start and a double [[circle]] indicates the finish. Circles are used to show the control points.&lt;ref name=ounlimited&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010412133640/http://orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-12 |title=Details of the sport of orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age-related classes====
At international, national, and the larger events, courses are classified by age, e.g., M35 for men 35 years of age and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties are usually combined into a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W50, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged by class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|title=Courses and classes - cutting through the confusion.|year=1997|publisher=Cyprus Orienteers|accessdate=2015-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010428/http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ability-based courses====
In the smaller events courses are provided by ability. The United States&lt;ref name=ounlimited/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClueSymbols&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/Biology/Faculty_Staff/hwilliams/Orienteering/clues.html |title=Orienteering Clue Symbols |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=www.williams.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]] use colour coding to define the difficulty of the courses. Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically and physically demanding courses being provided for experienced orienteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runningforfun.co.uk/orienteering.html|title=Orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= www.runningforfun.co.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent courses and other events====
Some orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, or club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kites, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.orienteering.org/new-o/resources/permanent-courses|title=Permanent Courses|publisher=US Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses are usually set up in public areas and there may be some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight hours only. Clubs also organise informal events for practice and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |title=Permanent orienteering courses |publisher=South London Orienteers and Wayfarers |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828191654/http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controls and control description sheet===
[[File:Control description.svg|thumb|right|Control description sheet (pictorial). `Opisy punktów' stands for 'Description of points'.]]
[[Control point (orienteering)|Control points]] are placed on features on the map that can be clearly identified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by white and orange "flags".&lt;!--(or white and red) needs to be in history--&gt;

Competitors receive a "control description sheet" or "clue sheet" which gives a precise description of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. For experienced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the ''IOF Control descriptions''.&lt;ref name=iof-controls-2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Control-Descriptions-2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=IOF Control descriptions|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control card and punching===
Each competitor is required to carry an electronic or paper control card, and to present it at the Start and hand it in at the Finish.  The control card is marked by some means at each control point to show that the competitor has completed the course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cards and needle punches are still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221055013/http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-21|title=Your first orienteering event|publisher=orienteer.com|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
The winner is normally the competitor with the fastest time, but other scoring systems can be used, e.g., score events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the day', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results being confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appendix I : Electronic Punching |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work= |publisher=www.britishorienteering.org.uk |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175505/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the results can include ''split times'' for competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate times to each control. With suitable computer software these times can be displayed in a graphical form (Progressograph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities|title=Organisers are responsible for|publisher=British Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804112125/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
Each competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, but there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the ''stub check''. The competitor hands in his stub at the start and his control card at the finish. Event officials match the two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can now request a ‘still to finish’ report listing all those competitors who punched at the start but have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must report to the finish whether they have completed the course or not.&lt;ref name=nutshell/&gt;&lt;ref name=ounlimited/&gt;

===Personal clothing===
IOF rule 21.1 is that the specification for clothing is delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required.&lt;ref name=iof-rules2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/document_library/rules_and_guidelines/foot_orienteering|title=IOF Foot-O Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614090613/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fdocument_library%2Frules_and_guidelines%2Ffoot_orienteering|archivedate=2008-06-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK rule 7.1.1 requires ''full body cover'': the torso and legs must be covered.&lt;ref name=bof-rules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|format=PDF|title=BOF Event Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171146/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|archive-date=2008-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organiser may allow shorts, e.g., in park or street orienteering.  In the United States, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is ''not'' required), unless specifically stated in the meet announcement.

The early competitors used standard athletic clothing, i.e., shorts and an athletic vest, which provided little protection for racing through [[undergrowth]]. Purpose-made lightweight [[nylon]] full-body suits were later adopted. The early ''O-suits'' were made in muted colours but modern suits are generally multi-coloured. Clubs often organise the bulk purchase of clothing, which are then made in the club colours with the club’s name prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer [[Spandex|lycra]] [[tights]] or leggings. [[Gaiters]] are also often worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used.

===Personal equipment===
[[File:Compasses orienteering.jpg|thumb|Thumb compass and protractor compass]]
The basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate [[wilderness|outdoor]] clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a [[whistle]] be carried for [[Whistle#Safety|safety]].

Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment:
* A [[thumb compass]], or [[protractor compass]] on a short wrist cord.
* A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions.
* A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.
* A map board, fixed to the handlebars or worn on the arm or strapped to the torso  (MTB-O, Ski-o and [[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] only).
* IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can refer to during a race, so [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and other electronic navigation devices are not used. ([[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] may allow them at some events).  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] logging devices that track and record position, without allowing competitors to refer to the data during the race, are permitted, and are increasingly being used for post-race route-choice analysis and live tracking for event spectators.

==Competition types==
[[File:Gold Relay UK WOC 2008-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Foot-O relay, the winner crosses the line – joined by the rest of his team]]

Orienteering events can be classified in many different aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Rules-2018-v1.14final.pdf |title=IOF rules |date=2018 |website=orienteering.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* By method of travel: [[FootO]], [[SkiO]], [[Mountain bike orienteering|MTBO]], etc.
* By the length: sprint, middle, long
* By the time the competition was held: day, night
* By the number of competitors: individual, team, relay
* By the visiting order of controls: cross-country (in a specific order), score (free to decide order)

===Long===
Classic orienteering involves a race between controls in a preset order.  The winner is the person who completes the course in the shortest time. This is called a "cross-country" course as distinct from a score course (see below). Courses are normally designed so that the fastest route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic race has a typical winning time of 75–90 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the "classic" course should be redesignated the "long".

===Middle===
The middle distance is a shorter cross-country race than the classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphasis more on fine navigation than route-choice. When races of this distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called "short" races, or "sprint-O". The short distance was introduced as a world championship discipline in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as "middle".

===Relay===
A [[relay race]] is run by a team of competitors each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total time. Relays usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of [[World Orienteering Championships]] both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which [[Jukola relay]] has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while [[25-manna]] has the highest number of legs 25.  To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning "forking". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word "leg". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer "lap" for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, "leg" is used for both terms.

===Score===
Competitors visit as many controls as possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass start (rather than staggered), with a time limit. Controls may have different point values depending on difficulty, and there is a point penalty for each minute late. The competitor with the most points is the winner.
The large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O is known as a [[Rogaining|rogaine]], competed by teams in events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is smaller. The format originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said to stand for Rugged Outdoor Group Activity Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a [[backronym]], as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail and Neil Phillips, who were among Australian Rogaining's first participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ptoc.org/begin_guide/htdocs/courses.html|title= Point-to-point orienteering (also called Cross-country orienteering)|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint===
Very short races, with winning times in the region of 12–15 minutes, often held in city [[park]]s and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Control sites can include benches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/specs/issom2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Specification for Sprint Orienteering Maps|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sprint distance may also be held in the forest, when it would be called a "forest sprint" as opposed to an "urban sprint". This distance was pioneered in the late 1990s as an elite event by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent "world cup" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF included a sprint distance in the orienteering world championships.

===Ultrasprint===
[[File:BDHX.jpg|thumb| 300 px|A setting for indoor ultrasprint orienteering]]
Ultrasprint events are held in a specially constructed labyrinth. Due to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint is a more spectator-friendly form of orienteering. Also, as the course is artificial, identical courses can be set in different geographical locations for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nopesport.com/news/1139-sheffield-ultrasprint Sheffield Ultrasprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportlabyrinth.com/index/0-10 Sport Labyrinth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night===
[[File:Start.jpg|thumb|Studying the map at the start of a night orienteering competition, or "night-o"]]
Competitors use a [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]] to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searching.  Competitors can travel at high speed to the vicinity of the control point, then sweep the area with the light to catch a reflection off the control flag.  If a night event starts before dark, a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal time in the light and dark. The two classic club relays, Tiomila and [[Jukola]], both include night legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4orienteering.com/terrain_association/56/
|title=Night Navigation
|accessdate=2008-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest.

===String===
Competitors follow a string around a short course, noting down things that they find on the way. This is generally used by young children and people new to the sport who want to find out what it is like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteeringusa.org/youth-leaders/materials/o-young |title=The String Course |accessdate=2012-05-04 |publisher=Orienteering USA}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precision===
Precision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a test of the competitors' ability to precisely match map and terrain.  Examples include [[trail orienteering|trail-O]] (untimed), TREC style [[mounted orienteering]], and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA).  Both trail-O and ROCA use decoys in the vicinity of the control point.

==The Olympics==
Efforts begun in 1996 to promote the inclusion of orienteering in the [[Olympic Games]] have so far been unsuccessful, although orienteering became a sport in the [[World Games]] in 2001, and is a sport in the Summer [[Deaflympics]].  Supporters recognize that the sport is neither television- nor spectator-friendly, the venue of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and the duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Gerry|title=The Olympics, Orienteering and Ireland|publisher=The Irish Orienteer|year=2008|edition=94|url=http://orienteering.ie/tio/94/OLYMPICS.htm|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to develop a format suitable for Olympic competitions have focused on park orienteering, micro-orienteering, and short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of the sport is most likely to be included in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the website of a Chicago Orienteering club, "the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicago-orienteering.org/newsletter/article0303f.htm|title=Current Status of Orienteering in the Olympics|publisher=Chicago Area Orienteering Club|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an official [[demonstration sport]], an international [[ski-orienteering]] event was held in [[Sugadaira Kōgen]], [[Japan]], as part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the [[1998 Winter Olympics|XVIII Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="IOF_Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |title=Extensive discussion on the Olympic item |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201155503/http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Orienteering Federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee in 2002 to include ski orienteering in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic Games]], noting that it could share the venue with the [[biathlon]] competitions.&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |title=Ski Orienteering's Olympic Bid |last=Rönnberg |first=Barbro |date=March 2002 |work=O-zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209145610/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outside [[Nordic countries]], "the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition", and the costs associated with new technology and a new results system.&lt;ref name="olympic_programme_commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/common/asp/download_report.asp?file=en_report_520.pdf&amp;id=520|title=Review of the Olympic Programme and the Recommendations on the Programme of the XX Olympic Winter Games, Turin 2006|last=Cararro|first=Franco|year=2002|publisher=Olympic Programme Commission|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[International Olympic Committee]] confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green light for continued Olympic campaign |last=Barbrod |first=Rönnberg |date=December 2005 |work=O-Zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209144914/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] decided not to include any new sports in this review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1972|title=Olympic programme updates|publisher=International Olympic Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|300px|right]]

'''Radio navigation''' or '''radionavigation''' is the application of [[radio]] frequencies to determine a position of an object on the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=DuttonNN15&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutton|first=Benjamin|title=Dutton's Nautical Navigation|year=2004|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=155750248X|pages=154–163|edition=15|chapter=15 – Basic Radio Navigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kay-Fried-ANS&gt;{{cite book|last=Kayton|first=Myron|title=Avionics Navigation Systems|year=1997|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=99–177|author2=Walter R. Fried |chapter=4 – Terrestrial Radio-Navigation Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[radiolocation]], it is a type of [[radiodetermination]].

The basic principles are measurements from/to [[electric beacon]]s, especially
* [[Direction (geometry)|directions]], e.g. by bearing, radio phases or interferometry,
* [[Distance measuring equipment|distances]], e.g. [[ranging]] by measurement of [[time of arrival|travel times]],
* partly also [[velocity]], e.g. by means of radio [[Doppler shift]].

==Bearing-measurement systems==
These systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground. Conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a [[radio fix]]. These were introduced prior to World War I, and remain in use today.

===Radio direction finding===
[[File:Earhart-electra 10.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amelia Earhart]]'s [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra]] had a prominent RDF loop on the cockpit roof.]]
{{Main article|Radio direction finder}}

The first system of radio navigation was the ''Radio Direction Finder'', or RDF.&lt;ref name="KF116"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;  By tuning in a [[radio station]] and then using a [[directional antenna]], one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna. A second measurement using another station was then taken. Using [[triangulation]], the two directions can be plotted on a map where their [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] reveals the location of the navigator. Commercial [[AM radio]] stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power, but strings of low-power [[Nondirectional beacon|radio beacon]]s were also set up specifically for this task, especially near [[airport]]s and harbours.

Early RDF systems normally used a [[loop antenna]], a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis.&lt;ref name="KF116"/&gt; At most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern, but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other, producing a sharp drop in reception known as the "null". By rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null, the relative bearing of the station can be determined. Loop antennas can be seen on most pre-1950s aircraft and ships.

===Reverse RDF===
[[File:The 'Black Beacon', Orford Ness - geograph.org.uk - 935140.jpg|thumb|right|The Orfordness Beacon as it appears today.]]

The main problem with RDF is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle, which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft. A smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna, but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult.

During the era between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground. As the antenna rotated through a fixed position, typically due north, the antenna was keyed with the [[morse code]] signal of the station's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station. Then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction. By timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null, then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station, the bearing of the station could be calculated.

The first such system was the German [[Telefunken Kompass Sender]], which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the [[Zeppelin]] fleet until 1918.&lt;ref name=bauer2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Arthur O.|title=Some historical and technical aspects of radio navigation, in Germany, over the period 1907 to 1945|url=http://www.cdvandt.org/Navigati.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=Dec 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved version was introduced by the UK as the [[Orfordness Beacon]] in 1929 and used until the mid-1930s. A number of improved versions followed, replacing the mechanical motion of the antennas with phasing techniques that produced the same output pattern with no moving parts. One of the longest lasting examples was [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]], which went into operation just before [[World War II]] and was used operationally under the name Consol until 1991. The modern VOR system is based on the same principles (see below).

=== ADF and NDB===
{{Main article|Non-directional beacon}}

A great advance in the RDF technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas, or a single highly directional [[solenoid]]. These receivers were dramatically smaller, more accurate, and simpler to operate. Combined with the introduction of the [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuit]], RDF systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s, and were known by the new name, [[automatic direction finder]], or ADF.

This also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these RDF systems, now referred to as ''non-directional beacons'' (NDB). As the LF/MF signals used by NDBs can follow the curvature of earth, NDB has a much greater range than [[VHF Omnidirectional Range|VOR]] which travels only in ''line of sight''. NDB can be categorized as ''long range'' or ''short range'' depending on their power. The frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750&amp;nbsp;kHz, but the same system can be used with any common AM-band commercial station.

===VOR===
[[File:VOR DME BUB.JPG|right|thumb|VOR transmitter station]]
{{Main article|VHF omnidirectional range}}

[[VHF omnidirectional range]], or VOR, is an implementation of the reverse-RDF system, but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated.

Instead of a single signal, the VOR transmitter sends out three signals – one is a simple voice channel that sends morse code to identify the station, another is a continuous signal sent in all directions, and the last is a signal that is rotated at 30 RPM. Like the Orfordness concept, the bearing of the station is measured by finding the rotating signal's peak or null. But instead of timing the signal, the rotating signal is changed in [[phase (waves)|phase]] in synchronicity with its rotation, such that it is in-phase when pointed north, 90 degrees off when it points east, and so forth. By comparing the phase of the received signal with the one being broadcast omnidirectionally, the angle can be determined using simple electronics. This angle is then displayed in the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] of the [[aircraft]], and can be used to take a [[position fixing|fix]] just like the earlier RDF systems, although it is easier to use.&lt;ref name="KF123"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

As VOR required two VHF receivers as well as a conventional radio for station identification, the system did not become popular until the era of miniaturized electronics, first with small tubes in the 1950s, and then transistorized systems in the 1960s. During this period it quickly took over from the older Radio Range system (see below). The signals from the stations could be received anywhere, as opposed to the beams which were only broadcast in certain directions, so in theory the VOR system could be used for free navigation from any to any point. In practice, the older Radio Range procedures were so widely used and standardized that VOR was used to produce a similar set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]] that remain in use today.

The US military also introduced a VOR-like system known as [[TACAN]]. It differed from VOR primarily in its modulation system, adding a Lorentz-like signal to accurately define the center of the rotating beam and thereby improve accuracy. It requires five receiver channels and additional electronics, an expensive requirement when it was introduced.&lt;ref name="KF133"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beam systems==
Beam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky, and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam. A number of stations are used to create an [[Airway (aviation)|airway]], with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel. These systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive, as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies. However, they did not provide navigation outside of the beams, and were thus less flexible in use. The rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after World War II made systems like VOR practical, and most beam systems rapidly disappeared.

===Lorenz===
{{Main article|Lorenz beam}}

In the post-World War I era, the Lorenz company of Germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center. By broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams, the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones. The system was accurate to less than a degree in some forms.

Originally known as "Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer" (LFF), or simply "Leitstrahl" (guiding beam), little money was available to develop a network of stations. Deployment was instead led by the US, where it formed the basis of a wide-area navigation system through the 1930s and 40s (see LFF, below). Development was restarted in Germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a [[blind landing]] aid. Although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the US LFF, deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the Orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]] system. In all of these roles, the system was generically known simply as a "Lorenz beam".

In the immediate pre-World War II era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system. This used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances (over England), and very powerful transmitters. Two such beams were used, crossing over the target to triangulate it. Bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver, using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs. The system was highly accurate, and the '[[Battle of the Beams]]' broke out when [[United Kingdom]] [[intelligence service]]s attempted, and then succeeded, in rendering the system useless through [[electronic warfare]]. Sonne, however, proved just as useful to the UK as Germany, and was left to operate unhindered throughout the war.

===Low frequency radio range===
[[File:LFR-photo.jpg|thumb|right|LFR ground station]]
{{Main article|Low frequency radio range}}
The low-frequency radio range (LFR, also other names) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying]] in the 1930s and 1940s in the U.S. and other countries, until the advent of the VOR in the late 1940s. It was used for both en route navigation as well as [[instrument approach]]es.

The ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected Lorenz beams in four cardinal directions. One of the beams was "keyed" with the morse code signal "A", dit-dah, with the second beam "N", dah-dit. Flying down the centreline produced a steady tone. The beams were pointed to the next station to produce a set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]], allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations. Effective course accuracy was about three degrees, which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for [[instrument approach]]es down to low minimums. At its peak deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the US.

=== Glide path and the localizer of ILS ===
The remaining widely used beam systems are '''glide path''' and the '''localizer''' of the ''[[instrument landing system]]'' (ILS). ILS uses a ''localizer'' to provide horizontal position, distance to the runway, and airport information, and ''glide path'' to provide vertical positioning. ILS can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings.&lt;br /&gt;
For more information see also: {{main article|Instrument landing system glide path|Instrument landing system localizer}}

==Transponder systems==
{{main article|Transponder}}
{{see also|Transponder landing system}}
Positions can be determined with any two measures of angle or distance. The introduction of [[radar]] in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances. Navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared, and remained in widespread use until recently. Today they are used primarily for aviation, although GPS has largely supplanted this role.

===Radar and transponders===

Early [[radar]] systems, like the UK's [[Chain Home]], consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers. The transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal, which is sent into space through broadcast antennas. When the signal reflects off a target, some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station, where it is received. The received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power, and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used.

The same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator's station, which is equipped with an [[oscilloscope]]. Electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time, a few microseconds. When sent to the X input of the oscilloscope, this causes a horizontal line to be displayed on the scope. This "sweep" is triggered by a signal tapped off the broadcaster, so the sweep begins when the pulse is sent. Amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the Y input, where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display. This causes a series of "blips" to appear along the horizontal axis, indicating reflected signals. By measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip, which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception, the distance to the object can be determined.

Soon after the introduction of radar, the radio [[transponder]] appeared. Transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal, normally a pulse on a particular frequency, the transponder sends out a pulse in response, typically delayed by some very short time. Transponders were initially used as the basis for early [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] systems; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation, but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later. Single blips were enemies, double blips friendly.

Transponder-based distance-distance navigation systems have a significant advantage in terms of positional accuracy. Any radio signal spreads out over distance, forming the fan-like beams of the Lorenz signal, for instance. As the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows, the area covered by the fan increases, decreasing the accuracy of location within it. In comparison, transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals, and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else. This allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range.

The latest transponder systems (mode S) can also provide position information, possibly derived from [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], allowing for even more precise positioning of targets.

===Bombing systems===
The first distance-based navigation system was the German [[Y-Gerät (navigation)|Y-Gerät]] blind-bombing system. This used a [[Lorenz beam]] for horizontal positioning, and a transponder for ranging. A ground-based system periodically sent out pulses which the airborne transponder returned. By measuring the total round-trip time on a radar's oscilloscope, the aircraft's range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges. An operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels, and indicated when to drop the bombs.

The British introduced similar systems, notably the [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] system. This used two stations in England that operated on different frequencies and allowed the aircraft to be triangulated in space. To ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations, and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator. The second station was used, as in Y-Gerät, to time the bomb drop. Unlike Y-Gerät, Oboe was deliberately built to offer very high accuracy, as good as 35&amp;nbsp;m, much better than even the best optical [[bombsight]]s.

One problem with Oboe was that it allowed only one aircraft to be guided at a time. This was addressed in the later [[Gee-H (navigation)|Gee-H]] system by placing the transponder on the ground and broadcaster in the aircraft. The signals were then examined on existing [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] display units in the aircraft (see below). Gee-H did not offer the accuracy of Oboe, but could be used by as many as 90 aircraft at once. This basic concept has formed the basis of most distance measuring navigation systems to this day.

===Beacons===
{{main article|Electric beacon}}
The key to the transponder concept is that it can be used with existing radar systems. The [[List of World War II British naval radar#ASV II|ASV]] radar introduced by [[RAF Coastal Command]] was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength. Adding a ground-based transponder immediately turned the same display into a system able to guide the aircraft towards a transponder, or "beacon" in this role, with high accuracy.

The British put this concept to use in their [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca/Eureka]] system, where battery-powered "Eureka" transponders were triggered by airborne "Rebecca" radios and then displayed on ASV Mk. II radar sets. Eureka's were provided to French resistance fighters, who used them to call in supply drops with high accuracy. The US quickly adopted the system for paratroop operations, dropping the Eureka with pathfinder forces or partisans, and then homing in on those signals to mark the drop zones.

The beacon system was widely used in the post-war era for blind bombing systems. Of particular note were systems used by the [[US Marines]] that allowed the signal to be delayed in such a way to offset the drop point. These systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them, directing fire on the enemy. Beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well, as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered, able to be man portable or mounted on a [[Jeep]].

===DME===
{{main article|Distance measuring equipment}}
{{see also|Tactical air navigation system}}
In the post-war era, a general navigation system using transponder-based systems was deployed as the [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) system.

DME was identical to Gee-H in concept, but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number, rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope. This led to the possibility that DME interrogation pulses from different aircraft might be confused, but this was solved by having each aircraft send out a different series of pulses which the ground-based transponder repeated back.

DME is almost always used in conjunction with VOR, and is normally co-located at a VOR station. This combination allows a single VOR/DME station to provide both angle and distance, and thereby provide a single-station fix. DME is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military [[TACAN]] system, and their DME signals can be used by civilian receivers.

==Hyperbolic systems==
{{main article|Hyperbolic navigation}}
Hyperbolic navigation systems are a modified form of transponder systems which eliminate the need for an airborne transponder. The name refers to the fact that they do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific [[navigational chart]] with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver's location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced navigation systems until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.

===Gee===
{{main article|Gee (navigation)}}
The first hyperbolic system to be developed was the British [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, developed during [[World War II]]. Gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals, with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays. An aircraft using Gee, [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s heavy [[bomber]]s, examined the time of arrival on an [[oscilloscope]] at the navigator's station. If the signal from two stations arrived at the same time, the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters, allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations. More typically, the signal from one station would be received earlier than the other. The ''difference'' in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations. By making similar measurements with other stations, additional lines of position can be produced, leading to a fix. Gee was accurate to about 165&amp;nbsp;yards (150&amp;nbsp;m) at short ranges, and up to a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) at longer ranges over Germany. Gee remained in use long after World War II, and equipped RAF aircraft as late as the 1960s (approx freq was by then 68&amp;nbsp;MHz).

===LORAN===
{{main article|LORAN}}
With Gee entering operation in 1942, similar US efforts were seen to be superfluous. They turned their development efforts towards a much longer-ranged system based on the same principles, using much lower frequencies that allowed coverage across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The result was [[LORAN]], for "LOng-range Aid to Navigation". The downside to the long-wavelength approach was that accuracy was greatly reduced compared to the high-frequency Gee. LORAN was widely used during convoy operations in the late war period.&lt;ref name=JBLoran-C&gt;{{cite web|title=The Loran-C System of Navigation|url=http://www.loran-history.info/Loran-C/Jansky%20_%20Bailey%201962.pdf|publisher=Jansky &amp; Bailey|accessdate=25 July 2013|pages=18–23|date=February 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decca===
{{main article|Decca Navigator System}}
Another British system from the same era was Decca Navigator. This differed from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.

===LORAN-C===
{{main article|Loran-C}}
Almost immediately after the introduction of LORAN, in 1952 work started on a greatly improved version. LORAN-C (the original retroactively became LORAN-A) combined the techniques of pulse timing in Gee with the phase comparison of Decca.

The resulting system (operating in the [[low frequency]] (LF) radio spectrum from 90 to 110&amp;nbsp;kHz) that was both long-ranged (for 60&amp;nbsp;kW stations, up to 3400 miles) and accurate. To do this, LORAN-C sent a pulsed signal, but modulated the pulses with an AM signal within it. Gross positioning was determined using the same methods as Gee, locating the receiver within a wide area. Finer accuracy was then provided by measuring the phase difference of the signals, overlaying that second measure on the first. By 1962, high-power LORAN-C was in place in at least 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jansky &amp; Baily 1962, pp.23–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

LORAN-C was fairly complex to use, requiring a room of equipment to pull out the different signals. However, with the introduction of [[integrated circuit]]s, this was quickly reduced further and further. By the late 1970s, LORAN-C units were the size of a stereo amplifier and were commonly found on almost all commercial ships as well as some larger aircraft. By the 1980s, this had been further reduced to the size of a conventional radio, and it became common even on pleasure boats and personal aircraft. It was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s, and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down, like Gee and Decca. However, like the beam systems before it, civilian use of LORAN-C was short-lived when GPS technology drove it from the market.

===Other hyperbolic systems===
Similar hyperbolic systems included the US global-wide [[VLF]]/[[Omega Navigation System]], and the similar [[Alpha (radio navigation)|Alpha]] deployed by the USSR. These systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals, but by comparison of a single signal with a local [[atomic clock]]. The expensive-to-maintain Omega system was shut down in 1997 as the US military migrated to using [[GPS]]. Alpha is still in use.

==Satellite navigation==
[[File:Cessna T182T Cockpit - Garmin G1000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cessna 182 with GPS-based "glass cockpit" avionics]]
{{Main article|Global Navigation Satellite System}}

Since the 1960s, navigation has increasingly moved to [[satellite navigation system]]s. These are essentially DME systems located in space. The fact that the satellites are in orbit and normally move with respect to the receiver means that the calculation of the position of the satellite needs to be taken into account as well, which can only be handled effectively with a computer.

The [[Global Positioning System]], better known simply as GPS, sends several signals that are used to decode the position and distance of the satellite. One signal encodes the satellite's "ephemeris" data, which is used to accurately calculate the satellite's location at any time. Space weather and other effects causes the orbit to change over time so the ephemeris has to be updated periodically. Other signals send out the time as measured by the satellite's onboard [[atomic clock]]. By measuring this signal from several satellites, the receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own. Comparing the two produces the distance to the satellite, and several such measurements allows a form of triangulation to be carried out.

GPS has better accuracy that any previous land-based system, is available at almost all locations on the Earth, can be implemented in a few cents of modern electronics, and requires only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage. As a result of these advantages, GPS has led to almost all previous systems falling from use. LORAN, Omega, Decca, Consol and many other systems disappeared during the 1990s and 2000s. The only other systems still in use are aviation aids, which are also being turned off for long-range navigation while new [[differential GPS]] systems are being deployed to provide the local accuracy needed for blind landings.

[[File:Cartographer Pietro Vesconte (1318).jpg|thumb|250px | Image of Petrus Vesconte]]
A '''''rhumbline network''''', or more properly called, a '''windrose network''', is a navigational aid drawn on [[portolan chart]]s. This network is like a web (see picture) forming a grid on the [[map]]. The grid can be easily spotted (as parchment is quite translucent) by observing the map from its rear face, with a light source illuminating the other side. The hole in the center of the circle, origin of the whole network, is also clearly visible from the rear.&lt;ref name="Harvey1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. D. A. Harvey|title=Medieval maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7QLAAAAYAAJ|year=1991|publisher=British Library|isbn=978-0-7123-0232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines are not true [[rhumb line]]s in the modern sense (reason to put the title in italics), since these can only be drawn on modern [[map projection]]s and not on 13th century charts.&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"/&gt; They were close to true rhumb lines in the Mediterranean area but highly inaccurate in the [[Teixeira planisphere]] and the other planispheres drawn in any pre-[[Mercator projection]].

== Rhumblines vs. windrose lines ==

[[Image:Europe Mediterranean Catalan Atlas.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A part of the Catalan Atlas. Copied from the [[Catalan Atlas|Catalan Atlas Wiki Page]]]]

All [[portolan map]]s share this characteristic "windrose networks", which emanate out from [[compass rose]]s located at various points on the map (or mapamundi). These better called "windrose lines" are generated "by observation and the compass", and designated today: "lines of course" or "lines of rhumb" ("rhumb lines" in the fourteenth century, traced on portolan's particular projection, though not to be confused with modern [[rhumb line]]s, [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]s or [[isoazimuthal]]s).

To understand that those lines should be better called "windrose lines", one has to know that [[portolan map]]s are characterized by the lack of [[map projection]], for cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in portolans, and those straight lines they could be [[loxodrome]]s only if the chart was drawn on a suitable projection.&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Bagrow|title=History of Cartography|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=OBeB4tDmJv8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=portolans+only+when+the+chart+is+drawn+on+a+suitable+projection+projection&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1Jii2vXkyAIVA7oaCh2VGwgb#v=onepage&amp;q=portolans%20only%20when%20the%20chart%20is%20drawn%20on%20a%20suitable%20projection%20projection&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2518-4|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As leo Bagrow states:''"..the word ("Rhumbline") is wrongly applied to the sea-charts of this period, since a loxodrome gives an accurate course only when the chart is drawn on a suitable projection. Cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in the early charts, for which we therefore retain the name 'portolan'."''&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"/&gt;

== Network design  ==
[[File:Atlantic map from Pietro Vesconte 1325 atlas.jpg|thumb|250px | Portolan by Petrus Vescomte]]
Pujades in his book "Les cartes portolanes" has a chapter with all known theories and, with the aim to clarify the controversial arguments, he shows an image of [[Petrus Vesconte]] drawing a [[portolan]] in one of his maps in which it is visible how he started by drawing first the rhumbline grid. Some authors call it "winds network" instead of using the term "rhumbline network" or "network of  rhumblines"&lt;ref name="Martín-Merás1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=María Luisa Martín-Merás|title=Cartografía marítima hispana: la imagen de América|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pWBEsFNlzNoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=para+pintar+los+vientos+o+rumbos+hace+de+tomar&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0MVcVf3oLsawUdSDgZgE&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=para%20pintar%20los%20vientos%20o%20rumbos%20hace%20de%20tomar&amp;f=false|date=1 January 1993|publisher=IGME|isbn=978-84-7782-265-3|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CamareroPastor1960"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernesto García Camarero|author2=Julio Rey Pastor|title=Julio Rey Pastor y Ernesto Garcia Camarero.

The [[circle]] is divided into sixteen equal parts defining an [[hexadecagon]], then the network of sailing directions "for a [[Compass rose|16 winds rose]]" is represented by groups of 16 "straight lines" called rhumblines. From each [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]], 7 rhumblines are projected towards the hexadecagon's interior connecting "in an alternated pace" to 7 of the vertex opposite to it, but without routing any line to connect that vertex to the other 8 intermixed vertex. The remaining 9 rhumblines (to complete the 16 winds) are projected from each vertex towards the exterior of the hexadecagon, although in some portolans those 9 lines do not appear.&lt;ref name = "Pujades2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramon J.Pujades i Bataller|title=Les cartes portolanes: la representació medieval d'una mar solcada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6F-NwAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya|isbn=978-84-9785-414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines of the [[course (navigation)|courses]] for the eight main directions (or winds) are drawn with black ink (or sometimes [[gold]]); the eight intermediate directions (half-winds) are drawn in green; and in the case of a 32 winds rose,  the sixteen remaining (quarter-winds) are drawn in red. The intersection of this set of "rhumblines"  determine on the portolans a varied pattern of symmetrical squares, parallelograms, trapezoids and triangles.&lt;ref name="Harvey1991"/&gt;

== Vellum map creation process  ==

The process for a vellum chart creation used to be as follows:

* They prepared a [[vellum]] of good size, or several of them glued together .
* They drew a well-centered [[hexadecagon]] (or two linked by a vertex) with a network of 16 lines per vertex (with the different colors mentioned above: black, green and red) &lt;ref name="Pujades2007" /&gt;
* They copied on top of the grid the [[coast]]s lines trying to let the 16 vertex in visible places, as shown in Vescomte's portolan picture with its rhumbline network drawing  a 16 vertex  regular polygon (hexadecagon) that is perfectly centered on the parchment.
* In the case of the [[Mediterranean]] sometimes contained two hexadecagons and has the two opposite corners matching what is called the "portolan diaphragm " (axis of the Mediterranean .. or parallel of [[Rhodes]])
* Finally they labeled and decorated the whole [[vellum]] with more or less profusion.

== Planispheres with double hexadecagon ==
In large planispheres, especially those containing the oceans ([[World Map]]), the cartographer used to draw two hexadecagons with the two opposite corners superimposed in the center of the vellum. There are plenty of [[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]] that use the double-hexadecagon rhumbline networks but they can not be considered portolan charts since they do not have any ports indicated on them.

In the [[Cresques planisphere]] one is able to read the names of those lines which were winds: tramontana, levante, ponente, mezzogiorno, greco, sirocco, and lebegio. When limited to small seas, planispheres approximately follow both rhumb lines and great circles. But on big oceans they do not follow either of them, due to the imprecision of the map making of that time, corresponding more or less accurately to [[rhumb lines]] only in the Mediterranean [[portolan chart]]s and deviating greatly in the [[Texeira planisfere]] (among others).

&lt;center&gt;

===Double hexadecagon in Cantino's planisphere===

[[File:5000px 1573 Teixeira.jpg |center|600px|Rhumb line construction scheme with two hexadecagon in the Texeira planisphere]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Use of rhumblines ==

To calculate on a [[portolan chart]] the course to follow from a [[Coordinate origin|point of origin]] to a point of destination, one should transfer &amp;mdash; using a [[parallel rule]] &amp;mdash; the "line of course" drawn from the point of origin to the point of destination, on top of the ''[[Compass rose]]'' closest to the ship's position, obtaining on it the theoretical course to be followed when sailing towards the destination. This theoretical course may have to be modified (as many times as needed) when tacking if the wind is right ahead of you, or to correct the effects of [[leeway]], [[tide|current]]s, etc... that a sailor with experience should be able to calculate empirically.

'''Right to light''' is a form of [[easement]] in [[English law]] that gives a long-standing owner of a building with windows a right to maintain the level of [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]]. It is based on the '''Ancient Lights''' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Ancient+lights+%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=On ancient lights: and the evidence ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights are most usually acquired under the [[Prescription Act 1832]].

==Rights==
In effect, the owner of a building with windows that have received natural daylight for 20 years or more is entitled to forbid any construction or other obstruction that would deprive him or her of that illumination. Neighbours cannot build anything that would block the light without permission. The owner may build more or larger windows but cannot enlarge their new windows before the new period of 20 years has expired. It is also possible for a right to light to exist if granted expressly by [[deed]], or granted implicitly, for example under the rule in ''[[Wheeldon v Burrows|Wheeldon v. Burrows]]'' (1879).

Once a right to light exists, the owner of the right is entitled to "sufficient light according to the ordinary notions of mankind": ''[[Colls v. Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd]]'' (1904). Courts rely on [[expert witnesses]] to define this term. Since the 1920s, experts have used a method proposed by [[Percy Waldram]] to assist them with this. Waldram suggested that ordinary people require one [[foot-candle]] of [[illuminance]] (approximately ten [[lux]]) for reading and other work involving visual discrimination. This equates to a [[sky factor]] (similar to the [[daylight factor]]) of 0.2%. Today, Waldram's methods are increasingly subject to criticism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=D62CF262C987771E9EA2A8DB73A9A48F?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1603352 Was Waldram wrong?], P Defoe, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pitts (2000), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=844738 The grumble point: is it still worth the candle?], ''[[Structural Survey]]'' '''18'''(5):255–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of expert evidence in rights to light cases is currently the subject of much debate within the surveying profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/Practiceareas/Property/Rightstolight/Rights%20to%20light%20the%20debate.html Rights to light surveying practice, the debate begins], Paul Chynoweth, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], owners of buildings could gain new rights by registering properties that had been destroyed in [[bombing]]s and the period was temporarily increased to 27 years.

In the centre of [[London]] near [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown]] and [[Covent Garden]], particularly in back alleyways, signs saying "Ancient Lights" can be seen marking individual windows. The design and construction of [[Broadcasting House]] in the early 1930s was also affected by locals declaring their right to ancient lights. It resulted in a unique asymmetrical sloped design that allowed for sunlight to pass over the building to the residential quarters eastwards, long since demolished and now home to the new Egton Wing.

Recent case law from 2010, relating to a commercial development in the centre of Leeds ([http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2245.html ''HKRUK II v Heaney'']) has significantly changed the perceptions of risk associated with right-to-light, particularly in the context of commercial schemes.  This case upheld an injunction against a commercial property. The result of this is that many developers are now looking to work with local authorities to try to use section 237 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]].  This potentially stops injunctions against schemes that have over-riding social or economic advantages to an area.

=== United States ===
Under [[United States tort law]], in ''[[Fontainebleau Hotel]] Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.'' (1959) the Florida [[Appellate Court]] stated that the "ancient lights" doctrine had been unanimously repudiated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/dgolash/fontainebleau%20v.%204525.htm FOUNTAINEBLEAU HOTEL CORP., a Florida corporation, and Charnofree Corporation, a Florida corporation, Appellants, v.

In 1984, voters in [[San Francisco]] passed Proposition K, which prevents construction of any building over 40 feet that casts a shadow on a public park, unless the Planning Commission decides the shadow is insignificant. This proposition causes problems for [[Oceanwide_Center,_San_Francisco|a proposed 34-story building south of Market Street]], which would cast a shadow on a public park ten blocks away, for one hour of the day in the fall, as well as St. Mary's Square, Justin Herman Plaza, and Union Square for significant parts of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=Long shadows create political hurdle for S.F. skyscraper project|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Long-shadows-create-political-hurdle-for-S-F-7382467.php|accessdate=30 June 2017|publisher=SF Chronicle|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] has similar laws against the casting of shadows on [[Boston Common]], the [[Public_Garden_(Boston)|Public Garden]], and other important public open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1990/1990acts0362.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shetland Stile.jpg|right|thumb|A wooden stile in [[Esha Ness]], [[Shetland]].]]
A '''stile''' is a structure which provides people a passage through or over a fence or boundary via [[Stairway|step]]s, [[ladder]]s, or narrow gaps. Stiles are often built in rural areas along [[footpath]]s, [[fence]]s, [[wall]]s or [[Hedge (barrier)|hedges]] to prevent farm animals moving from one enclosure to another whilst allowing path users still to use the route.

==Types==
[[File:Hanbury, Worcs, bridge stile 2.jpg|thumb|Bridge-shaped stile in [[Hanbury, Worcestershire]]]]
In the United Kingdom many stiles were built under legal compulsion (see ''[[Rights of way in the United Kingdom (disambiguation)|Rights of way in the United Kingdom]]''). Recent changes in UK government policy towards farming has encouraged upland landowners to make access more available to the public, and this has seen an increase in the number of stiles and an improvement in their overall condition. However stiles are deprecated in British Standard BS5709:2018 Gaps Gates &amp; Stiles ({{ISBN 978 0 580 98210 1}}) and are increasingly being replaced by [[gate]]s or [[kissing gate]]s or, where the field is arable, the stile removed. Many legacy stiles remain, however, in a variety of forms (as it also the case in the US, where there is no standard). As well as having a variety of forms, stiles also sometimes include a 'dog latch' or 'dog gate' to the side of them, which can be lifted to enable a dog to get through (see pictures below).

[[File:Squeezer stile. - geograph.org.uk - 110502.jpg|right|thumb|A squeeze stile]]
An alternative form of stile is a '''squeeze stile''', which is commonly used where footpaths cross [[dry stone wall]]s in England. With this type of stile there is a vertical gap in the wall, usually no more than {{convert|25|cm}} wide, and often with stone pillars on either side to protect the structure of the wall. The gap must be narrow enough to prevent livestock getting through.

[[Image:Starting point of Little stony man nature trail Shenandoah NP 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Trailhead sign]]
A '''trailhead''' is the point at which a [[trail]] begins, where the trail is often intended for hiking, biking, horseback riding, or off-road vehicles. Modern trailheads often contain rest rooms, maps, sign posts and distribution centers for informational brochures about the trail and its features, and parking areas for vehicles and trailers.

[[Image:Trailhead.JPG|thumb|left|Kiosk at a trailhead]]
Historically, the cities located at the terminus of major pathways for foot traffic such as the [[Natchez Trace]] and the [[Chisholm Trail]] were also known as trailheads.

For mountain climbing and hiking, the elevation of the trailhead above [[sea level]] is given to give an idea of how high the mountain is above the [[Height above average terrain|average terrain]].

{{TOC limit|2}}

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid parameters==

The series must be used with a  [[Datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] which specifies the position, orientation and shape of a [[Figure of the Earth|Reference ellipsoid]]. Although the projection formulae depend only on the shape parameters of the reference ellipsoid the full set of datum parameters is necessary to link the projection coordinates to true positions in three-dimensional space. The datums and reference ellipsoids associated with particular implementations of the Redfearn formulae are listed [[#Implementations|below]].  A comprehensive list of important ellipsoids is given in the article on the [[Figure of the Earth#table|Figure of the Earth]].

{{space|5}}In specifying ellipsoids it is normal to give the [[semi-major axis]] (equatorial axis), &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, along with either the [[Flattening|inverse flattening]], &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt;, or the  [[semi-minor axis]] (polar axis), &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes both.  The series presented below use the eccentricity, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, in preference to the flattening, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. In addition they use the parameters &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[Flattening#First and second flattening|third flattening]], and &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|second eccentricity]]. There are only two independent shape parameters and there are many relations between them: in particular
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 f&amp;=\frac{a-b}{a}, \qquad  e^2=2f-f^2, \qquad e'^2=\frac{e^2}{1-e^2}\\
b&amp;=a(1-f)=a(1-e^2)^{1/2},\qquad  n=\frac{a-b}{a+b}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The projection formulae also involve  &lt;math&gt;\rho(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of the meridian (at latitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\nu(\phi) &lt;/math&gt;,  the radius of curvature in the [[prime vertical]].
(The prime vertical is the vertical plane orthogonal to the  meridian plane at a point on the ellipsoid). The radii of curvature  are defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nu(\phi)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}},
\qquad
\rho(\phi)=\frac{\nu^3(1-e^2)}{a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In addition  the functions &lt;math&gt;\beta(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\beta(\phi)=\frac{\nu(\phi)}{\rho(\phi)},\qquad
   \eta^2=\beta-1={e'^2\cos^2\!\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For compactness it is normal to introduce the following abbreviations:
:&lt;math&gt;
s=\sin\phi,\qquad
c=\cos\phi,\qquad
t=\tan\phi.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==Preliminaries II: meridian distance==

===Meridian distance===
The article on [[Meridian arc]] describes several methods of computing &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the meridian distance  from the equator to a point at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; : the expressions given below are those used in the '''actual'' implementation of the Transverse Mercator projection by the OSGB.&lt;ref name=osgb /&gt; The truncation error is less than 0.1mm so the series is certainly accurate to within 1mm, the design tolerance of the OSGB implementation.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m(\phi)&amp;=B_0\phi+B_2\sin 2\phi+B_4\sin4\phi+B_6\sin6\phi+\cdots,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients are given to order &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt; (order &lt;math&gt;e^6&lt;/math&gt;) by
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 B_0  &amp;=  b\bigg(1+n+\frac{5}{4}n^2+\frac{5}{4}n^3 \bigg),
 \qquad
B_4 =  b\bigg(\frac{15}{16}n^2+\frac{15}{16}n^3 \bigg),\\
 B_2  &amp;= -    b\bigg(\frac{3}{2}n+\frac{3}{2}n^2+\frac{21}{16}n^3 \bigg),
 \qquad
 B_6 = -    b\bigg(\frac{35}{48}n^3\bigg).
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The meridian distance from equator to pole is 
::&lt;math&gt;m_p=m(\pi/2)=\pi B_0/2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The form of the series specified for UTM is a variant of the above exhibiting higher order terms with a truncation error of 0.03mm.

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

====Inverse meridian distance====

Neither the OSGB nor the UTM implementations define an inverse series for  the meridian distance; instead they use an iterative scheme. For a given meridian distance &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; first set &lt;math&gt;\phi_0=M/B_0&lt;/math&gt; and then iterate using
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\phi_n=\phi_{n-1}+ \frac{M-m(\phi_{n-1})}{B_0}, \qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
until &lt;math&gt;|M-m(\phi_{n-1})|&lt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;mm.

{{space|5}}The inversion ''can'' be effected by a series, presented here for later reference.  For a given meridian distance, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,  define the [[latitude|rectifying latitude]] by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mu=\frac{\pi M}{2 m_p}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The geodetic latitude corresponding to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is (Snyder&lt;ref name=snyder /&gt; page 17)&lt;!--(Krüger,&lt;ref name=kruger /&gt; page 12&amp;ndash;13)--&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\phi&amp;=\mu+D_2\sin 2\mu+D_4\sin4\mu+D_6\sin6\mu+D_8\sin8\mu+\cdots,\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where, to &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  D_2 &amp; = \frac{3}{2}n-\frac{27}{32}n^3, &amp;
  D_4 &amp; = \frac{21}{16}n^2-\frac{55}{32}n^4,\\[8pt]
  D_6 &amp; = \frac{151}{96}n^3, &amp;
  D_8 &amp; = \frac{1097}{512}n^4.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==An outline of the method==
&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;
The normal aspect of the Mercator projection of a  sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is described by the equations
:&lt;math&gt;
x  = R\lambda, \qquad\qquad y  = R\psi,
&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Latitude#Isometric latitude|isometric latitude]], is given by
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\psi &amp;= \ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--  &amp; = \frac {1}{2} \ln \left[ \frac {1 + \sin\phi}{1 - \sin\phi} \right] \\[2ex]
  &amp; = \sinh^{-1} \left( \tan\phi\right)
  &amp; = \tanh^{-1} \left( \sin\phi\right)--&gt;

On the ellipsoid the isometric latitude becomes
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\psi &amp;= \ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \right]
      -\frac{e}{2} \ln \left[ \frac {1 + e\sin\phi}{1 - e\sin\phi} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
By construction, the projection from the geodetic coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to the coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) is conformal. If the coordinates (&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) are used to define a point &lt;math&gt;\zeta=\psi+i\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane, then any analytic function &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; will define another conformal projection. Kruger's method involves seeking the specific &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;  which generates a uniform scale along the central meridian, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;.  He achieved this by investigating a Taylor series approximation with the projection coordinates  given by:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y+ix&amp;=f(\zeta)=f(\psi+i\lambda)\\
    &amp;= f(\psi+i.0) + A_1\lambda+ A_2\lambda^2+ A_3\lambda^3+ \ldots,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the real part of &lt;math&gt;f(\psi+i.0)&lt;/math&gt; must be proportional  to the meridian distance function &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. The (complex) coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; depend on derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; which can be reduced to derivatives of &lt;math&gt;m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, (not &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). The derivatives are straightforward to evaluate in principle but the expressions become very involved at high orders because of the  complicated relation between &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Separation of real and imaginary parts gives the series for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and further derivatives give the scale and convergence factors.

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

==The series in detail==
This section presents  the eighth order series as published by Redfearn&lt;ref name=Redfearn/&gt; (but with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; interchanged and the longitude difference from the central meridian denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;). Equivalent eighth order series, with different notations, can be found in Snyder&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{Cite book| author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections &amp;ndash; A Working Manual. U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 | publisher =United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. | year=1987}}This paper can be downloaded from [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395 USGS pages.] It gives full details of most projections, together with interesting introductory sections, but it does not derive any of the projections from first principles.&lt;/ref&gt; (pages 60&amp;ndash;64) and at many web sites such as that for the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;{{cite web |title=A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain |format=PDF |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{space|5}}The direct series are developed in terms of the longitude difference from the central meridian, expressed in radians: the inverse series are developed in terms of the ratio  &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;. The projection is normally restricted to narrow zones (in longitude) so that both of the expansion parameters are typically less than about 0.1, guaranteeing rapid [[Convergence (mathematics)|convergence]]. For example in each [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] zone these expansion parameters are less than 0.053 and for the British national grid ([[British national grid reference system|NGGB]]) they are less than 0.09. All of the direct series giving &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, convergence &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are functions of both latitude and longitude and the parameters of the ellipsoid: all inverse series giving &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are functions of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the parameters of the ellipsoid.

===Direct series===
In the following series &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the ''difference'' of the longitude of an arbitrary point and the longitude of the chosen central meridian: &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is in radians and is positive east of the central meridian. The W coefficients are functions of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; listed [[#The coefficients for all series|below]].  The series for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the scaled meridian distance when &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x(\lambda,\phi)&amp;=k_0\nu\left[\lambda c
                      +\frac{\lambda^3c^3 W_3}{3!}
                      +\frac{\lambda^5c^5 W_5}{5!}
                      +\frac{\lambda^7c^7 W_7}{7!}\right] , \\[1ex]
  y(\lambda,\phi)&amp;=k_0\left[m(\phi) +\frac{\lambda^2 \nu c^2t}{2}
               +\frac{\lambda^4 \nu c^4tW_4}{4!}
               +\frac{\lambda^6 \nu c^6tW_6}{6!}
               +\frac{\lambda^8 \nu c^8tW_8}{8!} \right],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

===Inverse series===
The inverse series involve a further construct: the '''footpoint latitude'''. Given a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; on the projection the '''footpoint''' is defined as the point on the central meridian with coordinates &lt;math&gt;(0,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the scale on the central meridian is &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; the meridian distance from the equator to the footpoint is equal to &lt;math&gt;m=y/k_0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding footpoint latitude, &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, is calculated by iteration or the inverse meridian distance series as described above.
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mu&amp;=\frac{\pi y}{2 m_p k_0},\\
\phi_1&amp;=\mu+D_2\sin 2\mu+D_4\sin4\mu+D_6\sin6\mu+D_8\sin8\mu+\cdots,\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Denoting functions evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; by a subscript '1', the inverse series are:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \lambda(x,y)
&amp;=
\frac{x}{c_1(k_0\nu_1)}
-\frac{x^{3}V_3}{3!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^3}
-\frac{x^{5}V_5}{5!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^5}
-\frac{x^{7}V_7}{7!c_1(k_0\nu_1)^7},
\\
\phi(x,y)&amp;=\phi_1
-\frac{x^2  \beta_1t_1 }{2(k_0\nu_1)^2}
-\frac{x^4 \beta_1t_1 U_4}{4!(k_0\nu_1)^4}
-\frac{x^6  \beta_1t_1 U_6}{6!(k_0\nu_1)^6}
-\frac{x^8 \beta_1t_1 U_8}{8!(k_0\nu_1)^8}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;

===Point scale and convergence===
The point scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is independent of direction for a conformal transformation. It may be calculated in terms of geographic or projection coordinates. Note that the series for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; reduce to &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; when either &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; .  The convergence &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; may also be calculated (in radians) in terms of geographic or projection coordinates:
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  k(\lambda,\phi)
&amp;=k_0\left[1
+\frac{\lambda^2c^2H_2}{2}
+\frac{\lambda^4c^4H_4}{24}
+\frac{\lambda^6c^6H_6}{720}\right],\\
\gamma(\lambda,\phi)
&amp;=\lambda s
+\frac{\lambda^3c^3t H_3}{3}
+\frac{\lambda^5c^5t H_5}{15}
+\frac{\lambda^7c^7tH_7}{315},\\
k(x,y)&amp;=k_0\left[1
+\frac{x^2K_2}{2(k_0\nu_1)^2}
+\frac{x^4K_4}{24(k_0\nu_1)^4}
+\frac{x^6K_6}{720(k_0\nu_1)^6}\right]\\
\gamma(x,y) &amp;=
\frac{xt_1}{k_0\nu_1}
 + \frac{x^3t_1 K_3}{3(k_0\nu_1)^3}
 + \frac{x^5t_1 K_5}{15(k_0\nu_1)^5}
 + \frac{x^7t_1 K_7}{315(k_0\nu_1)^7}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Accuracy of the series===

''Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions'' (Supplement No. 1 to Canadian Cartographer, Vol 13.) pp. 1&amp;ndash;14, 92&amp;ndash;101 and 107&amp;ndash;114. Toronto: Department of Geography, York University. A report of unpublished analytic formulae involving incomplete elliptic integrals obtained by E. H. Thompson in 1945. Available from the [http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/120327/?sortorder=asc&amp;p_o=113|University of Toronto Press].&lt;/ref&gt;  implemented by Karney (2011),&lt;ref name=karney&gt;C. F. F. Karney (2011), ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00190-011-0445-3 Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers],'' J. Geodesy 85(8), 475-485 (2011); preprint of paper and C++ implementation of algorithms are available at [https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/tm.html geographiclib.sourceforge.io]&lt;/ref&gt; is of great value  in assessing the accuracy of the truncated Redfearn series.  It confirms that the truncation error  of the (eighth order) Redfearn series is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to a longitude difference of 3 degrees, corresponding to a distance of 334&amp;nbsp;km from the central meridian at the equator but a mere 35&amp;nbsp;km at the northern limit of an UTM zone.

{{space|5}}The Redfearn series become much worse as the zone widens. Karney discusses Greenland as an instructive example. The long thin landmass is centred on 42W and, at its broadest point, is no more than 750&amp;nbsp;km from that meridian whilst the span in longitude reaches almost 50 degrees. The Redfearn series attain a maximum error of 1&amp;nbsp;'''kilometre'''.

==Implementations==
The implementations give below are examples of the use of the Redfearn series. The defining documents in various countries differ slightly in notation and, more importantly, in the neglect of some of the small terms. The analysis of small terms depends on the latitude and longitude ranges in the various grids. There are also slight differences in the formulae utilised for meridian distance: one extra term is sometimes added to the formula specified above but such a term is less than 0.1mm.

===OSGB===
The implementation of the transverse Mercator projection in Great Britain is fully described in the [[OSGB]] document [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/support/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain], Appendices A.1, A.2 and C.&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt;
::datum: OSGB36
::ellipsoid: Airy 1830
:: major axis: 6 377 563.396
:: minor axis: 6 356 256.909
::central meridian longitude: 2°W
::central meridian scale factor : 0.9996012717
:: projection origin: 2°W and 0°N
::true grid origin: 2°W and 49°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0 (metres): 400,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0 (metres): -100,000
::E = E0 + x = 400000 + x
::N = N0 + y -k0*m(49°)= y - 5527063
The extent of the grid is 300&amp;nbsp;km to the east and 400&amp;nbsp;km to the west of the central meridian and 1300&amp;nbsp;km north from the ''false'' origin, (OSGB&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt; Section 7.1), but with the exclusion of parts of Northern Ireland, Eire and France. A [[grid reference]] is denoted by the pair (E,N) where E ranges from slightly over zero to 800000m and N ranges from zero to 1300000m. To reduce the number of figures needed to give a grid reference, the grid is divided into 100&amp;nbsp;km squares, which each have a two-letter code. National Grid positions can be given with this code followed by an easting  and a northing both in the range 0 and 99999m. 

{{space|5}}The projection formulae differ slightly from the Redfearn formulae presented here. They have been simplified by neglect of most terms of seventh and eighth order in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;: the only exception is seventh order term in the series for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;x/a&lt;/math&gt;. This simplification is based on the examination of the Redfearn terms over the ''actual'' extent of the grid. The only other differences are (a) the absorption of the central scale factor into the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]] and [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]], (b) the replacement of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (defined [[#Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid|above]]).

The OSGB manual&lt;ref name=osgb/&gt;  includes a discussion of the [[Helmert transformation]]s which are required to link [[Geodetic datum|geodetic]] coordinates on Airy 1830 [[Reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] and on WGS84.

===UTM===
The article on the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator projection]] gives a general survey, but the full specification is defined in U.S. Defense Mapping Agency  Technical Manuals TM8358.1&lt;ref name=utm1 /&gt; and TM8358.2.&lt;ref name=utm2 /&gt; This section provides details for '''zone 30''' as another example of the Redfearn formulae  (usually termed Thomas formulae in the United States.)
::ellipsoid: International 1924 (a.k.a. Hayford 1909)
:: major axis: 6 378 388.000

::central meridian longitude: 3°W
:: projection origin: 3°W and 0°N
::central meridian scale factor: 0.9996
::true grid origin: 3°W and 0°N

::E = E0 + x = 500000 + x

::northern hemisphere: N = N0 + y = y
::southern hemisphere false northing of true grid origin N0: 10,000,000
::southern hemisphere: N = N0 + y = 10,000,000 + y
The series adopted for the meridian distance incorporates terms of fifth order in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but the manual states that these are less than 0.03&amp;nbsp;mm (TM8358.2&lt;ref name=utm2 /&gt; Chapter 2).  The projection formulae use, &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt;, the second eccentrity (defined [[#Preliminaries I: datum and ellipsoid|above]]) instead of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The grid reference schemes are defined in the article [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]]. The accuracy claimed for the UTM projections is 10&amp;nbsp;cm in grid coordinates and 0.001 arc seconds for geodetic coordinates.

===Ireland===
The transverse Mercator projection in Eire and Northern Ireland (an international implementation spanning one country and part of another) is currently  implemented  in two ways:

[[Irish grid reference system]]
::datum: Ireland 1965
::ellipsoid: Airy 1830 modified
:: major axis: 6 377 340.189
:: minor axis: 6 356 034.447
::central meridian scale factor: 1.000035
::true origin: 8°W and 53.5°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0: 200,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0: 250,000
The Irish grid uses the OSGB projection formulae.

[[Irish Transverse Mercator]]
::datum: Ireland 1965
::ellipsoid: [[GRS80]]
:: major axis: 6 378 137
:: minor axis: 6 356 752.314140
::central meridian scale factor: 0.999820
::true origin: 8°W and 53.5°N
::false easting of true grid origin, E0: 600,000
::false northing of true grid origin, N0: 750,000
This is an interesting example of the transition between use of a traditional ellipsoid and a modern global ellipsoid. The adoption of radically different false origins helps to prevent confusion between the two systems.

The '''transverse Mercator''' [[map projection]] is an adaptation of the standard [[Mercator projection]]. The transverse version is widely used in national and international mapping systems around the world, including the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]. When paired with a suitable [[geodetic datum]], the transverse Mercator delivers high accuracy in zones less than a few degrees in east-west extent.

==Standard and transverse aspects==
The transverse Mercator projection is the [[map projection#Aspect_of_the_projection|transverse aspect]] of the standard (or ''Normal'') Mercator projection. They share the same underlying mathematical construction and consequently the transverse Mercator inherits many traits from the normal Mercator:
* Both [[map projection|projections]] are [[map projection#Cylindrical|cylindrical]]: for the Normal Mercator, the axis of the cylinder coincides with the polar axis and the line of tangency with the equator. For the transverse Mercator, the axis of the cylinder lies in the equatorial plane, and the line of tangency is any chosen meridian, thereby designated the ''[[Meridian (geography)|central meridian]]''.
* Both projections may be modified to secant forms, which means the scale has been reduced so that the cylinder slices through the model globe.
* Both exist in spherical and [[Figure of the Earth|ellipsoidal]] versions.
* Both projections are [[conformal map|conformal]], so that the [[Scale (map)|point scale]] is independent of direction and ''local'' shapes are well preserved;
* Both projections have constant scale on the line of tangency (the equator for the normal Mercator and the central meridian for the transverse).

Since the central meridian of the transverse Mercator can be chosen at will, it may be used to construct highly accurate maps (of narrow width) anywhere on the globe. The secant, ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator is the most widely applied of all projections for accurate large-scale maps.

==Spherical transverse Mercator==
In constructing a map on any projection, a [[Spherical Earth|sphere]] is normally chosen to model the Earth when the extent of the mapped region exceeds a few hundred kilometers in length in both dimensions. For maps of smaller regions, an [[Figure of the Earth|ellipsoidal model]] must be chosen if greater accuracy is required; see next section. The spherical form of the transverse Mercator projection was one of the seven new projections presented, in 1772, by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].&lt;ref name=lambert &gt;Lambert, Johann Heinrich. 1772. ''Ammerkungen und Zusatze zurder Land und Himmelscharten Entwerfung''.

(Editor), 1894. ''Ostwald's Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften''

Available at the [http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ABR2581.0001.001 University of Michigan Historical Math Library].&lt;/ref&gt; (The text is also available in a modern English translation.&lt;ref name="tobler"&gt;Tobler, Waldo R, ''Notes and Comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps'', 1972 (University of Michigan Press). Reprinted (2010) by Esri: [http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=1284&amp;Category_ID=38]&lt;/ref&gt;) Lambert did not name his projections; the name ''transverse Mercator'' dates from the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=flattening&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =University of Chicago Press| year=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7 | page=82}} This is an excellent survey of virtually all known projections from antiquity to 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal properties of the transverse projection are here presented in comparison with the properties of the normal projection.

==Ellipsoidal transverse Mercator==
The ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator projection was developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1825&lt;ref name=gauss1825&gt;Gauss, Karl Friedrich, 1825. "Allgemeine Auflösung der Aufgabe: die Theile einer gegebnen Fläche auf einer andern gegebnen Fläche so abzubilden, daß die Abbildung dem Abgebildeten in den kleinsten Theilen ähnlich wird" Preisarbeit der Kopenhagener Akademie 1822.

Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, New Series 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The projection is known by several names: Gauss Conformal or Gauss-Krüger in Europe; the transverse Mercator in the US; or Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator generally. The projection is conformal with a constant scale on the central meridian. (There are other conformal generalisations of the transverse Mercator from the sphere to the ellipsoid but only Gauss-Krüger has a constant scale on the central meridian.) Throughout the twentieth century the Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator was adopted, in one form or another, by many nations (and international bodies);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Projects/Alpsis/Docs/ref_grid_sh_proc_draft.pdf | title = Short Proceedings of the 1st European Workshop on Reference Grids, Ispra, 27–29 October 2003 | publisher = [[European Environment Agency]] | date = 2004-06-14 | accessdate = 2009-08-27 | page = 6}} The EEA recommends the transverse Mercator for conformal pan-European mapping at scales larger than 1:500,000.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition it provides the basis for the [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] series of projections. The Gauss–Krüger projection is now the most widely used projection in accurate large-scale mapping.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The projection, as developed by Gauss and Krüger, was expressed in terms of low order power series which were assumed to diverge in the east-west direction, exactly as in the spherical version. This was proved to be untrue by British cartographer E. H. Thompson, whose unpublished exact (closed form) version of the projection, reported by L. P. Lee in 1976,&lt;ref name="lee_exact"&gt;Lee, L.P. (1976). ''Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions''. Supplement No. 1 to ''Canadian Cartographer'', Vol 13. (Designated as Monograph 16).

This is the most striking difference between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions of the transverse Mercator projection: Gauss–Krüger gives a reasonable projection of the ''whole'' ellipsoid to the plane, although its principal application is to accurate large-scale mapping "close" to the central meridian.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[File:MercTranEll.png|center|thumb|350px|Ellipsoidal transverse Mercator: a finite projection.]]

===Features===
*Near the central meridian (Greenwich in the above example) the projection has low distortion and the shapes of Africa, western Europe, the British Isles, Greenland, and Antarctica compare favourably with a globe.
* The central regions of the transverse projections on sphere and ellipsoid are indistinguishable on the small-scale projections shown here.
*The meridians at 90° east and west of the chosen central meridian project to horizontal lines through the poles. The more distant hemisphere is projected above the north pole and below the south pole.
*The equator bisects Africa, crosses South America and then continues onto the complete outer boundary of the projection; the top and bottom edges and the right and left edges must be identified (i.e. they represent the same lines on the globe). (Indonesia is bisected.)
*Distortion increases towards the right and left boundaries of the projection but it does not increase to infinity. Note the Galapagos Islands where the 90° west meridian meets the equator at bottom left.
*The map is conformal. Lines intersecting at any specified angle on the ellipsoid project into lines intersecting at the same angle on the projection. In particular parallels and meridians intersect at 90°.
*The point scale factor is independent of direction at any point so that the shape of a ''small'' region is reasonably well preserved. The necessary condition is that the magnitude of scale factor must not vary too much over the region concerned. Note that while South America is distorted greatly the island of Ceylon is small enough to be reasonably shaped although it is far from the central meridian.
*The choice of central meridian greatly affects the appearance of the projection. If 90°W is chosen then the whole of the Americas is reasonable. If 145°E is chosen the Far East is good and Australia is oriented with north up.

In most applications the [[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system]] is applied to a narrow strip near the central meridians where the differences between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions are small, but nevertheless important in accurate mapping. Direct series for scale, convergence and distortion are functions of eccentricity and both latitude and longitude on the ellipsoid: inverse series are functions of [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] and both ''x'' and ''y'' on the projection. In the secant version the lines of true scale on the projection are no longer parallel to central meridian; they curve slightly. The convergence angle between projected meridians and the ''x'' constant grid lines is no longer zero (except on the equator) so that a grid bearing must be corrected to obtain an azimuth from true north. The difference is small, but not negligible, particularly at high latitudes.

===Implementations of the Gauss–Krüger projection===
In his 1912&lt;ref name="kruger"/&gt; paper, Krüger presented two distinct solutions, distinguished here by the expansion parameter:
* '''Krüger&amp;ndash;''n''''' (paragraphs 5 to 8): Formulae for the direct projection, giving the coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', are fourth order expansions in terms of the third flattening, ''n'' (the ratio of the difference and sum of the major and minor axes of the ellipsoid). The coefficients are expressed in terms of latitude (''φ''), longitude (''λ''), major axis (''a'') and eccentricity (''e''). The inverse formulae for ''φ'' and ''λ'' are also fourth order expansions in ''n'' but with coefficients expressed in terms of ''x'', ''y'', ''a'' and ''e''.
* '''Krüger–''λ''''' (paragraphs 13 and 14): Formulae giving the projection coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' are expansions (of orders 5 and 4 respectively) in terms of the longitude ''λ'', expressed in radians: the coefficients are expressed in terms of ''φ'', ''a'' and ''e''. The inverse projection for ''φ'' and ''λ'' are sixth order expansions in terms of the ratio {{sfrac|''x''|''a''}}, with coefficients expressed in terms of ''y'', ''a'' and ''e''. (See [[Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series]].)

The Krüger–''λ'' series were the first to be implemented, possibly because they were much easier to evaluate on the hand calculators of the mid twentieth century.

Redfearn extended the series to eighth order and examined which terms were necessary to attain an accuracy of 1 mm (ground measurement). The [[Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series|Redfearn series]] are still the basis of the OSGB map projections.&lt;ref name=osgb /&gt;

*Many variants of the Redfearn series have been proposed but only those adopted by national cartographic agencies are of importance. For an example of modifications which do not have this status see [[Transverse Mercator: Bowring series]]). All such modifications have been eclipsed by the power of modern computers and the development of high order ''n''-series outlined below.  The precise Redfearn series, although of low order, cannot be disregarded as they are still enshrined in the quasi-legal definitions of OSGB and UTM etc.

===Exact Gauss–Krüger and accuracy of the truncated series===
An exact solution by E. H. Thompson is described by L. P. Lee.&lt;ref name=lee_exact /&gt; It is constructed in terms of elliptic functions (defined in chapters 19 and 22 of the NIST&lt;ref&gt;F. W.J. Olver, D.W. Lozier, R.F. Boisvert, and C.W. Clark, editors,2010, NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Cambridge University Press), available online at URL http://dlmf.nist.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; handbook) which can be calculated to arbitrary accuracy using algebraic computing systems such as Maxima.&lt;ref&gt;Maxima, 2009, A computer algebra system, version 5.20.1, URL http://maxima.sf.net.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an implementation of the exact solution is described by Karney (2011).&lt;ref name=karney&gt;C. F. F. Karney (2011), ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00190-011-0445-3 Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers]'', J. Geodesy 85(8), 475-485 (2011); preprint of paper and C++ implementation of algorithms are available at [https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/tm.html tm.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact solution is a valuable tool in assessing the accuracy of the truncated ''n'' and λ series. For example, the original 1912 Krüger–''n'' series compares very favourably with the exact values: they differ by less than 0.31&amp;nbsp;μm within 1000&amp;nbsp;km of the central meridian and by less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to 6000&amp;nbsp;km. On the other hand, the difference of the Redfearn series used by Geotrans and the exact solution is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to a longitude difference of 3 degrees, corresponding to a distance of 334&amp;nbsp;km from the central meridian at the equator but a mere 35&amp;nbsp;km at the northern limit of an UTM zone. Thus the Krüger–''n'' series are very much better than the Redfearn λ series.

The Redfearn series becomes much worse as the zone widens. Karney discusses Greenland as an instructive example. The long thin landmass is centred on 42W and, at its broadest point, is no more than 750&amp;nbsp;km from that meridian while the span in longitude reaches almost 50 degrees. Krüger–''n'' is accurate to within 1&amp;nbsp;mm but the Redfearn version of the Krüger–''λ'' series has a maximum error of 1&amp;nbsp;kilometre.

Karney's own 8th-order (in ''n'') series is accurate to 5&amp;nbsp;nm within 3900&amp;nbsp;km of the central meridian.

==Formulae for the spherical transverse Mercator==

===Spherical normal Mercator revisited===
[[File:Cylindrical Projection basics.svg|thumb|400px|center|The normal aspect of a tangent cylindrical projection of the sphere]]
The normal cylindrical projections are described in relation to a cylinder tangential at the equator with axis along the polar axis of the sphere. The cylindrical projections are constructed so that all points on a meridian are projected to points with ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''aλ'' and ''y'' a prescribed function of ''φ''. For a tangent Normal Mercator projection the (unique) formulae which guarantee conformality are:&lt;ref name=merc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = a\lambda\,,\qquad
y  = a\ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\varphi}{2} \right)\right]
   = \frac{a}{2}\ln\left[\frac{1+\sin\varphi}{1-\sin\varphi}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;
Conformality implies that the [[Scale (map)|point scale]], ''k'', is independent of direction: it is a function of latitude only:
:&lt;math&gt;k(\varphi)=\sec\varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;
For the secant version of the projection there is a factor of ''k''{{sub|0}} on the right hand side of all these equations: this ensures that the scale is equal to ''k''{{sub|0}} on the equator.

===Normal and transverse graticules===
[[File:Transverse mercator graticules.svg|thumb|400px|center|Transverse mercator graticules]]
&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;
The figure on the left shows how a transverse cylinder is related to the conventional graticule on the sphere. It is tangential to some arbitrarily chosen meridian and its axis is perpendicular to that of the sphere. The ''x''- and ''y''-axes defined on the figure are related to the equator and central meridian exactly as they are for the normal projection. In the figure on the right a rotated graticule is related to the transverse cylinder in the same way that the normal cylinder is related to the standard graticule. The 'equator', 'poles' (E and W) and 'meridians' of the rotated graticule are identified with the chosen central meridian, points on the equator 90 degrees east and west of the central meridian, and great circles through those points.

[[File:Transverse mercator geometry.svg|thumb|Transverse mercator geometry]]
The position of an arbitrary point (''φ'',''λ'') on the standard graticule can also be identified in terms of angles on the rotated graticule: ''φ′'' (angle M′CP) is an effective latitude and −''λ′'' (angle M′CO) becomes an effective longitude. (The minus sign is necessary so that (''φ′'',''λ′'') are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that (''φ'',''λ'') are related to the standard graticule). The Cartesian (''x′'',''y′'') axes are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that the axes (''x'',''y'') axes are related to the standard graticule.

The tangent transverse Mercator projection defines the coordinates (''x′'',''y′'') in terms of −''λ′'' and ''φ′'' by the transformation formulae of the tangent Normal Mercator projection:
:&lt;math&gt;x' = -a\lambda'\,\qquad
y'  = \frac{a}{2}
         \ln\left[\frac{1+\sin\varphi'}{1-\sin\varphi'}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;
This transformation projects the central meridian to a straight line of finite length and at the same time projects the great circles through E and W (which include the equator) to infinite straight lines perpendicular to the central meridian. The true parallels and meridians (other than equator and central meridian) have no simple relation to the rotated graticule and they project to complicated curves.

===The relation between the graticules===
The angles of the two graticules are related by using [[spherical trigonometry]] on the spherical triangle NM′P defined by the true meridian through the origin, OM′N, the true meridian through an arbitrary point, MPN, and the great circle WM′PE. The results are:&lt;ref name=merc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin\varphi'&amp;=\sin\lambda\cos\varphi,\\
\tan\lambda'&amp;=\sec\lambda\tan\varphi.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Direct transformation formulae===
The direct formulae giving the Cartesian coordinates (''x'',''y'') follow immediately from the above. Setting ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y′'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''x′'' (and restoring factors of ''k''{{sub|0}} to accommodate secant versions)
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;= \frac{1}{2}k_0a
         \ln\left[
       \frac{1+\sin\lambda\cos\varphi}
        {1-\sin\lambda\cos\varphi}\right],\\[5px]
y(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;= k_0 a\arctan\left[\sec\lambda\tan\varphi\right],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The above expressions are given in Lambert&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; and also (without derivations) in Snyder,&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections—A Working Manual. U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 | publisher =United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. | year=1987}}This paper can be downloaded from [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395 USGS pages.] It gives full details of most projections, together with interesting introductory sections, but it does not derive any of the projections from first principles.&lt;/ref&gt; Maling&lt;ref name=maling&gt;{{cite book | author=Maling, Derek Hylton | title=Coordinate Systems and Map Projections | publisher =Pergamon Press| year=1992|isbn=0-08-037233-3 |edition=second}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Osborne&lt;ref name=merc&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130924093049/http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/ The Mercator Projections] Detailed derivations of all formulae quoted in this article&lt;/ref&gt; (with full details).

===Inverse transformation formulae===
Inverting the above equations gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \lambda(x,y)&amp;
= \arctan\left[ \sinh\frac{x}{k_0a}
                     \sec\frac{y}{k_0a} \right],
\\[5px]
  \varphi(x,y)&amp;= \arcsin\left[ \mbox{sech}\;\frac{x}{k_0a}
                        \sin\frac{y}{k_0a} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Point scale===
In terms of the coordinates with respect to the rotated graticule the [[Scale (map)|point scale]] factor is given by ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sec&amp;nbsp;''φ′'': this may be expressed either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  k(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;=\frac{k_0}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2\lambda\cos^2\varphi}},\\[5px]
k(x,y)&amp;=k_0\cosh\left(\frac{x}{k_0a}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The second expression shows that the scale factor is simply a function of the distance from the central meridian of the projection. A typical value of the scale factor is ''k''{{sub|0}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.9996 so that ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 when ''x'' is approximately 180&amp;nbsp;km. When ''x'' is approximately 255&amp;nbsp;km and ''k''{{sub|0}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.0004: the scale factor is within 0.04% of unity over a strip of about 510&amp;nbsp;km wide.

{{anchor|convergence}}

===Convergence===
[[File:Transverse mercator convergence.svg|right|thumb|upright|The angle of convergence]]

The convergence angle ''γ'' at a point on the projection is defined by the angle measured ''from'' the projected meridian, which defines true north, ''to'' a grid line of constant ''x'', defining grid north. Therefore, ''γ'' is positive in the quadrant north of the equator and east of the central meridian and also in the quadrant south of the equator and west of the central meridian. The convergence must be added to a grid bearing to obtain a bearing from true north. For the secant transverse Mercator the convergence may be expressed&lt;ref name=merc/&gt; either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\gamma(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;=\arctan(\tan\lambda\sin\varphi),\\[5px]
\gamma(x,y)&amp;=\arctan\left(\tanh\frac{x}{k_0a}\tan\frac{y}{k_0a}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Details of actual implementations

* Gauss-Kruger series in longitude: [[Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series]]
* Gauss-Kruger series in ''n'' (third flattening): [[Transverse Mercator: flattening series]]
* Exact (closed form) transverse Mercator projection: [[Transverse Mercator: exact solution]]
* Fourth order Redfearn series by concise formulae (example): [[Transverse Mercator: Bowring series]]

==Coordinates, grids, eastings and northings==
The projection coordinates resulting from the various developments of the ellipsoidal transverse Mercator are Cartesian coordinates such that the central meridian corresponds to the ''x'' axis and the equator corresponds to the ''y'' axis. Both ''x'' and ''y'' are defined for all values of ''λ'' and ''ϕ''. The projection does not define a grid: the grid is an independent construct which could be defined arbitrarily. In practice the national implementations, and UTM, do use grids aligned with the Cartesian axes of the projection, but they are of finite extent, with origins which need not coincide with the intersection of the central meridian with the equator.

The '''true grid origin''' is always taken on the central meridian so that grid coordinates will be negative west of the central meridian. To avoid such negative grid coordinates, standard practice defines a '''false origin''' to the west (and possibly north or south) of the grid origin: the coordinates relative to the false origin define '''eastings''' and '''northings''' which will always be positive. The '''false easting''', ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the distance of the true grid origin  east of the false origin. The '''false northing''', ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the distance of the true grid origin north of the false origin. If the true origin of the grid is at latitude ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on the central meridian and the scale factor the central meridian is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then these definitions give eastings and northings by:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    E&amp;=E_0+x(\lambda,\varphi),\\[5px]
    N&amp;=N_0+y(\lambda,\varphi)-k_0 m(\varphi_0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The terms "eastings" and "northings" do not mean strict east and north directions. Grid lines of the transverse projection, other than the ''x'' and ''y'' axes, do not run north-south or east-west as defined by parallels and meridians. This is evident from the global projections shown above. Near the central meridian the differences are small but measurable. The difference between the north-south grid lines and the true meridians is the [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|angle of convergence]].

A '''tunnel valley''' is a large, long, [[U-shaped valley]] originally cut under the [[glacial ice]] near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past [[ice ages|glacial ages]].&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Jørgensen | first =Flemming   | authorlink =   |author2=Peter B.E. Sandersen   | title = Buried and open tunnel valleys in Denmark—erosion beneath multiple ice sheets  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 25  | issue = 11–12  | pages = 1339–1363  | publisher =   | location =   | date = June 2006  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2005.11.006     | id =   |bibcode = 2006QSRv...25.1339J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tunnel valley can be as long as {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep (its depth may vary along its length).

Tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water and served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to [[fjord]] walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.

They presently appear as dry valleys, lakes, seabed depressions, and as areas filled with sediment. If they are filled with sediment, their lower layers are filled primarily with glacial, [[glacio-fluvial|glaciofluvial]] or [[glaciolacustrine deposits|glaciolacustrine]] sediment, supplemented by upper layers of temperate infill.&lt;ref name=Stucki2010&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Durst Stucki | first =Mirjam   | authorlink =   | author2 = Regina Reber and Fritz Schlunegger  | title = Subglacial tunnel valleys in the Alpine foreland: an example from Bern, Switzerland  | journal = Swiss Journal of Geosciences | volume =   103| issue =   3| pages =   363–374| publisher =  Springer (Online First) | location =   | date = June 2010  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1007/s00015-010-0042-0     | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in areas formerly covered by glacial ice sheets including Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, Australia and offshore in the North Sea, the Atlantic and in waters near Antarctica.

Tunnel valleys appear in the technical literature under several terms, including tunnel channels, subglacial valleys, [[iceway]]s, [[Snake coils (geology)|snake coils]] and linear incisions.

==Significance==
Understanding tunnel valleys is important because: 
* They serve as a marker for areas with the potential for effective oil exploration in Africa
* Their bedrock boundaries and glacial infill makes them effective aquifers in many regions
* Soil engineers must accommodate the variations which they exhibit when boring tunnels and establishing foundations
* They provide one of several signatures marking the edge of former glaciations

Tunnel valleys play a useful role in identifying oil rich areas in [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]]. The Upper [[Ordovician]]–Lower [[Silurian]] materials there contain a roughly {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick, carbon-rich layer of black shale. Approximately 30% of the world's oil is found in these shale deposits. Although the origin of these deposits is still under study,  it has been established that the shale routinely overlies glacial and glacio-marine sediment deposited ~445 million years before the present by the [[Hirnantian|Hirnantian glaciation]]. The shale has been linked to glacial meltwater nutrient enrichment of the shallow marine environment. Hence the presence of tunnel valleys is an indicator of the presence of oil in these areas.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armstrong| first =Howard A. | authorlink = | author2 = Geoffrey D.

Tunnel valleys represent a substantial fraction of all melt-water drainage from glaciers. Melt-water drainage influences the flow of glacial ice, which is important in understanding of the duration of glacial–interglacial periods and aids in identifying glacial cyclicity, a problem that is important to palaeoenvironmental investigations.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smellie | first = John L. | authorlink = | author2 = J.S.

Tunnel valleys are typically eroded into bedrock and filled with glacial debris of varying sizes. This configuration makes them excellent at capturing and storing water. Hence they serve an important role as [[aquifer]]s across much of [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].  Examples include [[Oak Ridges Moraine| Oak Ridges Moraine Aquifer]], Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, [[Mahomet Aquifer]], the [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_164191.htm Saginaw Lobe Aquifer], and the [http://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_m/M-text1.html Corning Aquifer].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Tunneldal Noordbergum.jpg|280px|left|thumb|A figure in Dutch showing the cross-section of a tunnel valley which has been refilled after erosion into bedrock.]]

===Buried, open and partially filled===
Tunnel valleys have been observed as open valleys and as partially or totally buried valleys.  If buried they may be partially or totally filled with glacial outwash or other debris. The valleys may be incised in bedrock, sand, silt, or clay.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

A part of a tunnel valley may go uphill: water can flow uphill if it is under pressure in an enclosed pipe: for example in [[Doggerland]] (submerged land which is now part of the bed of the [[North Sea]]) are some infilled tunnel valleys that flowed from north to south across the hollow of the [[Outer Silver Pit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SrsrE8oZx44C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Doggerland&amp;ots=YzrIXDuQeI&amp;sig=DaeFOytqn6t-JpW1-zBTGqVqO50#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Vincent Gaffney, Kenneth Thomson, Simon Finch, Mapping Doggerland: The Mesolithic Landscapes of the Southern North Sea, University of Birmingham, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===
They vary in channel depth and width; Danish examples run from {{convert|0.5|-|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and from {{convert|50|–|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.  They vary in depth/altitude along their course, exhibiting [[overdeepening]]; overdeepened sections cut into bedrock and typically are significantly deeper than either upstream or downstream sections of the same tunnel valley. They have steep sides which are frequently [[asymmetric valley|asymmetric]].&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys frequently include relatively straight individual segments parallel to and independent of one another. Tunnel valley courses may be periodically interrupted; the interruption may include a stretch of elevated [[esker]], indicating the channel ran through ice for a distance. The below-grade sections typically run {{convert|5|-|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length; in some cases the sections form a larger pattern of an interrupted channel composed of strings of depressions which can extend from {{convert|70|-|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

===Structure===
The upstream portion – that section furthest into the glacier – consists of a branching system forming a network, similar to the [[Anastomosis|anastomostic]] branching patterns of the upper reaches of a river (as contrasted with [[wikt:dendritic|dendritic]] patterns). They typically exhibit the largest cross-sectional area in the center of the course and terminate over a relatively short distance in elevated outwash fans at the ice-margin.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys are found to cross the regional gradient – as a result they may be crosscut by modern stream networks. In one example, tributaries of the Kalamazoo River cut at nearly right angles across buried tunnel channel filled with ice and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The water flow was from upper right to lower left. Close examination shows the existence of buried tunnel valleys as well – they can be identified by contrasting vegetation.]]

Tunnel valley channels often start or stop abruptly.  They have convex-up longitudinal profiles. They are often occupied by elongated lakes of [[underfit]] streams.  They frequently show signs of subsequent depositions such as eskers.&lt;ref name=Fisher2005/&gt;

===Evidence of erosion mechanisms===
Evidence suggests that erosion in a tunnel valley is primarily the result of water flow. They erode by meltwater, which it has been argued, episodically drains in repeated [[jökulhlaup]]s from subglacially stored lakes and reservoirs; examples of such motion have been observed in [[Antarctica]]. Although there is evidence of ice erosion such as linear striations in the bedrock, these are observed only in the widest valleys, and are believed to have played a secondary role.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

The subglacial layout of  valley tunnels/channels is predominantly oriented parallel to glacial ice flow lines – essentially they stretch from areas of thicker sheet ice toward areas of thinner sheet ice. They can exhibit reverse gradients, which result when pressurized meltwater flows over obstacles such as ridges or hills along the glacier bed.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Tunnel valleys can be formed under extremely thick glacial ice – examples have been observed on the bottom of [[Lake Superior]] and in the oceans offshore in Antarctica. The course of a tunnel valley typically runs from thickest glacial ice to the glacier margin; as a result the glacial ice pressurizes the water such that it runs uphill toward its end.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

==Formation of tunnel valleys/channels==
Although there is agreement on the role of meltwater in creation of tunnel valleys, several theories are still under consideration for the role of that meltwater:
:*Steady state theory – Boulton and Hindmarsh propose a steady state theory. They suggest tunnel valleys form in unconsolidated sediment when meltwater flows under pressure through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive removal of sediment by meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to create a tunnel valley through a positive feedback mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boulton1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Boulton  | first = G.A.|author2=R.C.A. Hindmarsh  | title = Sediment deformation beneath glaciers; rheology and geological consequences | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 92 | issue = B2 | pages = 9059–9082 | publisher = American Geophysical Union| location = | date = 27 January 1987 | url = | issn = | doi =  10.1029/JB092iB09p09059| id = | bibcode=1987JGR....92.9059B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Jökulhlaup driven erosion – Piotrowski argues that ice sheets may, in some instances, be cold-based; that is they contact land that is frozen (permafrost) and they freeze to the permafrost. Meltwater builds up behind this frozen ice terminus until it generates sufficient pressure to lift the ice and break the bond, with a catastrophic meltwater release such as is seen with the [[Iceland]]ic [[jökulhlaup]]. As a consequence of this jökulhlaup a tunnel valley is formed.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
:*Upglacier erosion – Wingfield proposes that tunnel valleys form gradually, with the valley head cutting progressively back toward the source up-glacier during deglaciation.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield R.; The origin of major incisions within the Pleistocene deposits of the North Sea
(1990) Marine Geology, 91 (1–2), pp.&amp;nbsp;31–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic outbursts of subglacial water have been observed moving subglacial water between subglacial lakes beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Satellite data recorded a subglacial discharge totaling {{convert|2|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}  traveling ~{{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} over a period of less than a year. As the flow subsided, the weight of ice closed the tunnel and sealed the lake again.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Wingham  | first = Duncan J.  | authorlink =   | author2 = Martin J. Siegert, Andrew Shepherd and Alan S. Muir  | title = Rapid discharge connects Antarctic subglacial lakes  | journal = Nature  | volume = 440  | issue =   7087| pages = 1033–1036  | publisher =   | location =   | date = 20 April 2006  | url =   | issn =     | pmid = 16625193| doi = 10.1038/nature04660  | id =   |bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1033W | last3 = Shepherd  | first3 = Andrew  | last4 = Muir  | first4 = Alan S.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water flow was modeled satisfactorily with channeling in ice and in sediment. The analytic model shows that over some regions, the ice-bedrock geometry included sections which would have frozen, blocking off flow, unless erosion of the sedimentary substrate was the means of creating a channel and sustaining the discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Carter  | first = Sasha P.  | authorlink =   | author2 = Donald D.

===Common features of tunnel valley theories===
[[File:Lagowski Park Krajobrazowy-World Wind.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A Polish [[ribbon lake]] formed in a tunnel valley. Note the variable width and the interruption between segments of the course. There is also evidence of other sediment-filled channels adjacent to this (e.g., two smaller lakes to the right)]]
Subglacial meltwater flow is common to all theories; hence a key to understanding channel formation is an understanding of subglacial meltwater flow. Meltwater may be produced on the glacier surface (supraglacially), below the glacier (basally) or both. Meltwater may flow either supraglacially or basally as well; the signatures of supraglacial and basal water flow differ with the passage zone. Supraglacial flow is similar to stream flow in all surface environments – water flows from higher areas to lower areas under the influence of gravity. Basal flow exhibits significant differences. In basal flow the water, either produced by melting at the base or drawn downward from the surface by gravity, collects at the base of the glacier in ponds and lakes in a pocket overlain by hundreds of meters of ice. If there is no surface drainage path, water from surface melting will flow downward and collect in crevices in the ice, while water from basal melting will collect under the glacier; either source will form a subglacial lake. The [[hydraulic head]] of the water collected in a basal lake will increase as water drains through the ice until the pressure grows high enough to either develop a path through the ice or to float the ice above it.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

===Steady state theory===
Sources of water and water drainage routes through and below temperate and sub-polar glaciers are reasonably well understood and provide a basis for understanding tunnel valleys. For these glaciers, supraglacial water ponds or moves in rivers across the surface of the glacier until it drops down a vertical crevice (a [[Moulin (geology)|moulin]]) in the glacier. There it joins subglacial water created by geothermal heat; some portion of the water drains into aquifers below the glacier. Excess subglacial water that cannot drain through sediment or impermeable bedrock as groundwater, moves either through channels eroded into the bed of sediment below the glacier (called Nye channels&lt;ref&gt;The smaller channels, known as ''Nye channels,'' are named after British physicist [[John Nye (scientist)|John Nye]].&lt;/ref&gt;) or through channels upward into the glacial ice (called Rothlisberger channels), eventually flowing out at the ice margin.  On the simplest level, the tunnel valley can be considered a larger-scale version of these phenomena.&lt;ref name=Eyles2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Eyles | first = Nick K | title = The role of meltwater in glacial processes | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 190 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 257–268 | publisher = | location = | date = 1 August 2006 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.05.018 | id = |bibcode = 2006SedG..190..257E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys or tunnel channels are produced by meltwater flows beneath glacial ice. Tunnel valleys are often buried or partially buried by sediment accumulation during periods of ice advance and retreat.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Shaw | first = J | authorlink = | author2 = A. Pugin, R.R. Young | title = A meltwater origin for Antarctic shelf bedforms with special attention to megalineations | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 102 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 364–375 | publisher = | location = | date = 15 December 2008 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.04.005 | id = |bibcode = 2008Geomo.102..364S | last3 = Young | first3 = R. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although attractive since it scales up the Nye channel formation which has been observed in sediments, a weakness of the steady state theory is that it requires that tunnel valleys be excavated in unconsolidated sediment, in which meltwater is initially forced through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive sediment erosion by the meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to creating an ever-larger tunnel valley. However the steady state theory appears not to account for erosion into bedrock, which has been extensively observed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Jökulhlaup driven erosion===
There is evidence that meltwater discharges are episodic.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006/&gt; This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice is lifted, and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice is most easily lifted (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) are lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.&lt;ref&gt;A [[waterbed]] analogy can be applied here – the water moves under the pressure of the overlying ice, just as it does when a mass is placed on a water bed.&lt;/ref&gt; As water collects, additional ice is lifted until a release path is created.

If no preexisting channel is present, the water is initially released in a broad-front [[jökulhlaup]] which can have a flow front that is tens of kilometers wide, spreading out in a thin front. As the flow continues, it tends to erode the underlying materials and the overlying ice, creating a channel even as the reduced pressure allows most of the glacial ice to settle back to the underlying surface, sealing off the broad front release and channelizing the flow. The direction of the channel is defined primarily by the overlying ice thickness and secondarily by the gradient of the underlying earth, and may be observed to “run uphill” as the pressure of the ice forces the water to areas of lower ice coverage until it emerges at a glacial face. Hence the configuration of the various tunnel valleys formed by a specific glaciation provide a general mapping of the glacier thickness when the tunnel valleys were formed, particularly if the original surface relief under the glacier was limited.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Analyses by Piotrowski demonstrate that the annual production of water from one typical catchment of {{convert|642000000|m3|cuft|abbr=out}} would normally drain through its associated tunnel valley in less than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Piotrowski  | first = Jan A.   | authorlink =   | title = Subglacial hydrology in north-western Germany during the last glaciation: groundwater flow, tunnel valleys and hydrological cycles  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 16  | issue = 2  | pages = 169–185  | publisher =   | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(96)00046-7  | id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..169P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris found in tunnels and at the mouth of tunnels tends to be coarse rocks and boulders – this is indicative of high flow velocities and an extremely erosive environment. This erosive environment is consistent with creation of tunnels over {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt; Piotrowski’s model predicts a cycle as follows: 
# Meltwater is produced as a result of geothermal heating from below. Surface ablation water is not considered as it would be minimal at the glacial maximum and evidence indicates that surface water does not penetrate more than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} into a glacier.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Meltwater initially drains through subglacial aquifers.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# When the hydraulic transmissivity of the substratum is exceeded, subglacial meltwater accumulates in basins.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Water accumulates sufficiently to open the ice blockage in the tunnel valley which accumulated after the last discharge.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# The tunnel valley discharges the meltwater excess – turbulent flow melts out or erodes the excess ice as well as eroding the valley floor.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# As the water level drops, the pressure decreases until the tunnel valleys again close with ice and water flow ceases.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;

===Post-erosion infill processes===
Tunnel valleys have similar characteristics, irrespective of whether they are formed on land or in a submerged environment. This is because they are formed by high pressure water under a thick ice sheet – in a submerged environment they still have sufficient pressure to erode tunnel valleys into configurations comparable to those generated on land.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Le Heron | first = Daniel Paul | author2 = Jonathan Craig and James L. Etienne | title = Ancient glaciations and hydrocarbon accumulations in North Africa and the Middle East | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 47–76 | publisher = © 2009 Elsevier B.V. | location = | date = April 2009 | doi =10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.02.001   | id = |bibcode = 2009ESRv...93...47L | last3 = Etienne | first3 = James L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys may remain open, partially filled or filled, as a function of the glacial recession. The filled configuration is significant because filled tunnel valleys become excellent reservoirs for either water (aquifer) or for oil. This results since relatively coarse-grained sandstones are located on the valley floors and valley margins and valley floor because the coarser-grained sediments settle out more easily and accumulate preferentially in the flowing water common to the tunnel valley fill stages.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The subglacial tunnel valley networks originally formed near the ice margin. Tunnel valleys are likely to fill with sediment as the result of meltwater release during glacial recession. Tunnel valleys fill in two main ways. In the first instance, debris carried by flow settles out and accumulates in the tunnel valley. Subsequently, once the ice has retreated sufficiently, marine deposits may be laid down, depending on the water depth at the ice front.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The tunnel valley sedimentary record is controlled by meltwater release flowrates and sediment burdens during glacial recession. The sediment found in the tunnel valley provides insight into whether it was laid down in a tidal environment, a transitional environment, or an essentially dry environment with good drainage. In the glaciomarine environment, glacially-related deposits are interbedded with to those similar to those on non-glaciated tidal areas; the tidal environment will show undertow dominated fans. The transitional environment is characterized by both mixed marine and fresh water life in a delta environment. In an essentially dry environment, the glacial flow carries sediment which accumulates much as it would in any stream bed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Large-scale structure===
[[Ice sheet dynamics|Ice flow within glaciers]] results from an increase in the surface slope of the glacier, which result from geographic features combined with an imbalance between the amounts of ice accumulated through precipitation and lost through [[ablation]]. The increased gradient increases the [[shear stress]] on a glacier until it begins to flow. The flow velocity and deformation are also affected by the slope of the ice, the ice thickness and temperature.

Punkari identified that [[ice sheets|continental ice sheets]] typically flow in fan-shaped lobes, which converge from separate sources and move at differing speeds. Lobes are separated by [[interlobular|interlobate]] zones, which have thinner ice coverage. Water collects in this interlobate area. The hydraulic head (pressure) is lower in areas of thinner ice; hence subglacial water tends to converge on the interlobate joint. The separate lobes move at different speeds, generating friction at the ice boundary; the heat released melts ice to release additional water. The surface of the interlobate area is crevassed, allowing surface meltwater, which runs down the ice surface to the lower area, to penetrate into the ice. As a result, the ice-flow patterns and the debris accumulation are different in interlobate zones. Specifically, tunnel valleys and [[esker]]s indicate water flow toward the interlobate zones, which are elevated as the result of debris carried and deposited there.&lt;ref name=Punkari1997&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Punkari   | first = Mikko   | authorlink =   | title = Glacial and Glaciofluvial Deposits in the Interlobate Areas of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet   | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews   | volume = 16   | issue =   7| pages = 741–753  | publisher = Elsevier Science Ltd.    | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi =   10.1016/S0277-3791(97)00020-6| id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..741P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They range from {{convert|10|-|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in depth, and {{convert|500|-|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The tunnel valleys are incised into the bedrock and can be traced for {{convert|2|-|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. In one example, in [[Mauritania]], in the western [[Sahara]], Late Ordovician [[siliciclastic]] glacial features and deposits on the North [[Gondwana]] continental shelf include incised channels identified as tunnel valleys. The filled tunnel valley are several kilometers long and several hundred meters wide.  Reconstructions conclude that these structures were located in glacier ice-margin regions; the cross-sections of the valleys are comparable to those confirmed to have formed glacially, the valleys end in outwash fans similar to tunnel valleys, and the infill is post-glacial typical of that observed for tunnel valleys.&lt;ref name= Ghienne1998&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Ghienne  | first = Jean François | author2 = John Shaw and Kenneth I.

The first level starts numbering at &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Amazonas Region]] and continues in alphabetical order up to &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Ucayali Region]]. Additional regions will be added to the end of the list, starting with the first available number.

The second level starts with &lt;code&gt;0101&lt;/code&gt; for the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas Province]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;2504&lt;/code&gt; for the last province [[Purús Province|Purús]] in the [[Ucayali Region]]. The provinces are numbered per region with the first province always being the one in which the regions capital is located. The remaining provinces are coded in alphabetical order. Additional provinces will be added per region to the end of the list, starting with the first available province number.

The third level; starts with &lt;code&gt;010101&lt;/code&gt; for the first district in the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas District]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;250401&lt;/code&gt; for the last district in the last province of the Ucayali region: [[Purús District]]. The districts are numbered per province with the first district always being the one in which the province’ capital is located. The remaining districts are coded in alphabetical order. Additional districts will be added per province to the end of the list, starting with the first available district number.

The '''Valdivia Expedition''', or ''Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition'' (German Deep Sea Expedition), was a scientific expedition organised and funded by the [[German Empire]] under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and was named after the ship which was bought and outfitted for the expedition, the [[SS Valdivia]]. It was led by the marine biologist [[Carl Chun]] and the expedition ran from 1898-1899 with the purpose of exploring the depths of the oceans below 500 fathoms, which had not been explored by the earlier [[Challenger Expedition]].

The Challenger Expedition was the expedition that established modern Oceanography, prompting many other expeditions which were either nationally and privately funded which would dredge the deep-sea in search of new and exotic species. This late 19th Century fascination with organisms found at great depths was unsurprising, because in the mid-19th century most scientists followed Abyssal Theory which stated that it was not possible for life to exist below 300 fathoms depth. [[Carl Chun]], a famed [[teuthology|teuthologist]], held had a deep conviction that there must be life, in abundance, which existed in the unknown abyssal regions of the oceans, a belief he shared with an increasingly large number of marine scientists.  This conviction along with his desire to further explore the areas of the oceans which were not covered by the Challenger Expedition that led him to propose that the German Empire organise its own expedition which was to be nationally funded with the approval of the Kaiser.

==Conception and preparation==
Chun proposed to the ''[[Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte]]'' (Society of German Naturalists and Doctors ), which was the German equivalent of the [[Royal Society]], that a German deep sea expedition be funded and equipped to explore the deep oceans. His proposal was well received and a resolution to approve the plan and recommend it to the German government was unanimously adopted on 24 September 1897. It was originally conceived as purely zoological expedition but [[Friedrich Ratzel]] suggested that chemical and physical observations be included in the expedition's remit and this was accepted. The German government approved the proposal and granted the expedition 300,000 marks in initial funding with promises of further grants to cover the expenses of the expedition and the publication costs of its findings.&lt;ref name = GJ&gt;{{cite article | title = The German Deep-Sea Expedition | year = 1898 | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 494-496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship, the ''[[SS Valdivia]]'', was chartered from the ''[[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft]]'' (HAPAG), which fitted the ship out with equipment such as dredging gear, specimen jars, deep sea traps and oceanographic equipment,  also outfitting the laboratories, while also providing the crew and provisions, all for a sum equivalent to £17,000, a sum which covered the company's expenses but did not allow for any profit.&lt;ref name = SGM&gt;{{cite article | journal = Scottish Geographical Magazine | volume = 16 | issue = 7| pages = 416-418 | title = The German deep sea expedition on the ship “Valdivia” | year = 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chun was the overall leader of the expedition.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt; A captain of whaling ships, Adalbert Krech, was appointed the ship's captain while the navigator was a Herr Sachse who was an employee of HAPAG's. The scientific staff was made up of the botanist Professor [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|W. Schimper]] of [[Bonn]], the zoologists [[Carl Apstein]], [[Ernst Vanhöffen]] and Fritz Braem, the oceanographer Gerhardt Schott, the chemist Paul Schmidt and Dr M. Bathman who was a bacteriologist and the ship's doctor, who died on the voyage. [[August Brauer]] and [[Otto zur Strassen]] who were zoologists by profession and Fritz Winter who was an artist and photographer, but these had no official status recorded.&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt;

==The Voyage==
[[File:Route Valdivia.png|thumb|Map of the route taken by the Valdivia Expedition]]
The ''Valdivia'' set sail from [[Hamburg]] on 1 August 1898&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; and made its first call into the harbour of [[Granton, Edinburgh]], where the scientists visited the offices of ''The Challenger'' Expedition Commission and were entertained by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]].&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; The expedition then sailed north, entering the Atlantic between the [[Faroe Islands]] and the [[Shetland Islands]] and then turning south towards the [[Canary Islands]] and the west coast of Africa, reaching [[Cape Town]] on the 26th August.&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; They then explored a major part of the Indian Ocean and the Antarctic Ocean, covering a total of 32,000 nautical miles.&lt;ref name = BHL&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2012/06/book-of-week-valdivia-expedition.html | title = Book of the Week: The Vadivia Expedition Deep sea dredging in the twilight zone with Teuthologist Carl Chun | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher = [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] | author = Jacqueline Ford | year = 2012 | work = Notes and News from BHL Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Valdivia'' was among the Antarctic ice for almost four weeks in November and December 1898 in the sea between [[Bouvet Island]], which was rediscovered by the expedition, and [[Enderby Land]]. During this time the crew observed around 180 icebergs many of which they sketched and photographed, however as the ''Valdivia'' was an ordinary steel hulled vessel the ship had to remain clear of the [[pack ice]].&lt;ref name = NOAA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/rarebooks/valdivia/welcome.html | title = Aus den Tiefen des Weltmeeres: Schilderungen von der Deutschen Tieffee-Expedition - From the Depths of the World Sea: Descriptions of the German Deep Sea Expedition) | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher = NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mills&gt;{{cite book | author = William J. Mills | title = Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 | pages = 147–148 | chapter = Chun, Carl | year = 2003 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 1576074226}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the biological, geological and geographic findings the expedition was also able to make significant meteorological observations.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt;

The ''Valdivia'' returned to Hamburg on 30 April 1899.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt;

==Publication of results==
The main aims of the expedition were to collect as many biological specimens as they could while focussing on how organisms adapted to the extreme conditions of the environment of the deep oceans. One result of this was that a number anatomical studies of light organs were carried out. One of the best known publications is ''Volume 15: Die Tiefsee-Fische'' by Brauer which has an editorial review by Chun consisting of a systematic and anatomical study of the deep sea fish specimens they collected on their voyage aboard the ''Valvidia'' which were illustrated by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Winter]]. Winter's illustrations make it clear that these deep sea fish are heavily reliant on senses other than their vision. Many are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] and in numbers these animals have the effect of making the deep, dark sea look like a night sky filled with stars.&lt;ref name = BHL/&gt;

The expeditions findings took 4 decades to be published, and they were published in 24 volumes as ''Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition auf dem Dampfer "Valdivia" 1898-1899'' (Scientific results of the German deep-sea expedition on the steamer "Valdivia" 1898-1899). Another much admired volume is Chun's own ''Die Cephalopoden'' in which Chun describes the [[vampire squid]] ''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'' the scientific name meaning "the vampire squid from hell".&lt;ref name = BHL/&gt; The type specimen was collected on the expedition.&lt;ref name = Wood&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/vsfh.php | title = Introducing ''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'', the vampire squid from Hell | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher =  Dr. James B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7216">The '''wedge prism''' is a [[prism (optics)|prism]] with a shallow [[angle]] between its input and output surfaces. This angle is usually 3 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or less. [[Refraction]] at the surfaces causes the prism to deflect light by a fixed angle. When viewing a scene through such a prism, objects will appear to be offset by an amount that varies with their distance from the prism.

==Deflection angle==
{{details|Prism (optics)}}
For a wedge prism in air, [[ray (optics)|rays]] of light passing through the prism are deflected by the angle &amp;delta;, which is approximately given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \approx (n - 1) \alpha\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the [[index of refraction]] of the prism material, and &amp;alpha; is the angle between the prism's surfaces.

==Applications==
The term "optical wedge" refers to any shallow angle between two plane surfaces of a window. This wedge may range from a few millionths of a degree of perfect parallelism to as much as three degrees of angle. Even though high-precision optics, such as [[optical flats]], may be lapped and polished to extremely high levels of parallelism, nearly all optics with parallel faces have some slight wedge. This margin of error is usually listed in [[Minute of arc|minutes]] or [[Second of arc|seconds of arc]]. Windows manufactured with an intentional wedge are often referred to as wedge prisms, and typically come with wedge angles of one, two, or three degrees. Many applications exist for wedge prisms, including laser-beam steering, rangefinding and variable focusing.

===Beam steering===
A pair of wedge prisms, called a [[Risley prism]] pair, can be used for [[beam steering]]. In this case, rotating one wedge in relation to the other will change the direction of the beam. When the wedges angle in the same direction, the angle of the refracted beam becomes greater. When the wedges are rotated  to angle in opposite directions, they cancel each other out, and the beam is allowed to pass straight through.

Moving a wedge either closer or farther away from the laser can also be used to steer the beam. When the wedge is moved closer to the target (farther away from the laser), the refracted beam will move across the target. When two wedges in opposite directions slide relative to each other they can be used to provide variable focusing for cameras, allowing objects at vastly different distances to be photographed, in focus, at the same focal plane. This method is common in aerial or  space launch-vehicle photography, when the distance to the object is changing very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;''Mounting Optics in Optical Instruments'' By Paul R. Yoder -- SaPIE 2008 Page 246--249&lt;/ref&gt; Wedges were sometimes used in [[rangefinding]], by combining the image formed by one telescope with the image formed by another.&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Optics and Optical Instruments'' By Fred A. Carson -- dover Publications 1969 Page AJ-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedge prism is primarily used in a similar manner as an [[angle gauge]] in variable-radius plot sampling. In this type of sampling, the wedge prism is used to estimate basal area of a group of trees by counting trees which are "in" or "out" of a plot centered on a single point. Because the wedge prism refracts light to offset the object of interest (e.g. a tree), it can be used to determine whether or not the tree should be counted from a given point, based on the [[diameter at breast height]] of the tree and its distance from that point.

In this type of sampling, the prism is held a comfortable distance away from the eye with the bottom edge parallel to the ground, and trees are sighted through the prism approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;ft. above the ground. A tree is an "in" tree if the offset section of the tree overlaps the bole as viewed without the prism (Figure 1). A tree where the offset section of the trunk is perfectly aligned with the original bole is a [[borderline tree]] (Figure 2) and DBH must be measured to determine if it should be counted (or, more commonly in practice, every other borderline tree is counted). A tree where the offset section of the tree does not overlap or touch the original bole is an "out" tree (Figure 3) and is not counted.

Basal area is estimated by multiplying the count of "in" trees at a given point by the 'factor' of the prism. Prism factor is based on the angle of the prism, and prisms are available in different factors, expressed in both square feet/acre (5, 10, 20 BAF are most common) and square meters/hectare (1-5 BAF are common). Prism size is chosen to yield a statistically valid estimate of basal area - 6-10 "in" trees per plot are required, which requires a prism of the proper factor depending on the size of the trees being cruised. Larger trees will be "in" from further away, and a larger factor prism (20 or 30&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ac, 5–8 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ha) can be used. Smaller trees will be "out" in a larger factor prism unless they are very close, and consequently a smaller factor prism must be used.

Importantly, the bottom edge of the prism must be roughly parallel to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in [[forestry]] today because the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center,&lt;ref&gt;Avery, Eugene Thomas; Burkhart, E. Harold. 2002. ''Forest Measurements'' 5th Edition. McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking [[forest inventory]] are [[clinometer]]s, [[Biltmore stick]]s, [[relascope]]s, and [[Diameter Tape]]s.

A wedge prism can also be used with a target placed at plot center, to establish fixed radius plots. In this function, the size of the target is carefully calibrated to the desired plot size, and the plot is defined as all the area in which the target is "in" as viewed through the prism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/24888 Comparison of combinations of sighting devices and target objects for establishing circular plots in the field&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Australian border''' was originally designated as [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]] (129° east). However, the border marked on the ground is some distance from this line.&lt;ref name=notstraight&gt;{{cite conference | title=An Historical Perspective – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A.

The closest settlement is [[Border Village]], 1,734&amp;nbsp;km to the south on the South Australian side of the border, on [[Eyre Highway]].

==Border delineation==
The Western Australian (WA) border marked on the ground, is not as straight as it looks on a map. The [[Northern Territory borders|Northern Territory border]] with Western Australia and the [[South Australian borders|South Australian border]] with Western Australia are displaced east–west by approximately 127 metres, due to errors within the limits of surveying technology available in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=notstraight /&gt;

Where Western Australia meets the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) and [[South Australia]] (SA) borders is a 127-metre segment running east–west along the [[26th parallel south]] [[latitude]] (26° south).&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

In June 1968, two monuments were erected to mark each end of this 127-metre segment, At the easternmost of these concrete [[Boundary marker|border markers]] all three borders meet, at [[Surveyor Generals Corner]].&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Australia history.gif|right|thumb|250px|Map showing the creation of the colonies/states and mainland territories.]]

===1788–1825===
In 1788 [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] claimed the continent of Australia only as far west as the [[135th meridian east]] (135° east) in accordance with his commission.&lt;ref name="NAA1787"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | title = Governor Phillip's Instructions 25 April 1787 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195616/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | archivedate = 15 June 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#26 January 1788|26 January 1788 – MAP]])

It has been suggested that the 1788 claim by the British of 135° east was in reference to [[Spanish Empire|Spain's]] claims under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].  Spain was seen as no longer having an interest in the area.  On the other hand, the other signatories to the treaty, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] still had a presence in [[Macau]] and [[East Timor]].  Adoption of 135° east as a boundary would minimise provocation of the Portuguese.  By 1825, however, Britain was powerful enough and found it convenient to adopt the original line of the Portuguese under the treaty, 129° east.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web |last = Brown |first = A.

===1825–29===
The line of 129° east first became a border in Australia as the western border of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) in 1825 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#16 July 1825|16 July 1825 – MAP]]).

On 16 July [[1825 in Australia|1825]], the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated at 129° east to take in the new settlement at [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]].&lt;ref name="TaylorP118"&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor

From 1825 to 1829 129° east was the NSW border, except that the settlement of [[King George's Sound]], now [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], was part of New South Wales from its establishment on 26 December 1826, until 7 March 1831 when it was made part of the Swan River Colony.&lt;ref name=srnsw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517;jsessionid=A40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |title=King George's Sound Settlement |work=State Records |publisher=[[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120618/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517%3Bjsessionid%3DA40C0DC3DCADFDD2F844802E811AA62B |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1829–32===
Following the settlement of the [[Swan River Colony]] (SRC) in [[1829 in Australia|1829]] ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#2 May 1829|2 May 1829 – MAP]]), the eastern boundary was declared to be 129° east, that is coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time.&lt;ref name="NAA1831transcript"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/wa5i_doc_1831.pdf | title = Transcript of Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | format = pdf| work = Documenting a Democracy  | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swan River Colony, started in 1829, was commissioned as the colony of Western Australia in March [[1831 in Australia|1831]].&lt;ref name="NAA1831"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | title = Commission appointing Stirling Governor and Commander-in-Chief 4 March 1831 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207042047/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=94 | archivedate = 7 February 2008 | df = dmy-all }} found cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1829 to 1832 129° east was the SRC/NSW border.

===1832–46===
The name of the Swan River Colony changed to Western Australia in 1832 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|6 February 1832 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 February 1832|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 February 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1832 to 1846 129° east was the WA/NSW border.

===1846–47===
In 1846 the colony of North Australia (NA) was proclaimed by Letters Patent, which was all of New South Wales north of 26° south. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#17 February 1846|17 February 1846 – Map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#17 February 1846|Territorial evolution of Australia – 17 February 1846]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1846 to 1847 129° east was the WA/NA border north of 26° south and the WA/NSW border south of the 26th parallel.

===1847–60===
In 1847 the colony of North Australia was revoked and reincorporated into New South Wales. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|15 April 1847 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#15 April 1847|Territorial evolution of Australia – 15 April 1847]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1847 to 1860 129° east was once again the WA/NSW border.

===1860–63===
In 1860 South Australia, which had been proclaimed a colony in 1836 ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#28 December 1836|28 December 1836 – MAP]]), west to the [[132nd meridian east|132° east]], changed their western border from 132° east to 129° east ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|1860 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1860|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1863 129° east was the WA/NSW border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1863–1911===
In 1863 that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia by Letters Patent and became known as the Northern Territory of South Australia (NToSA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|6 July 1863 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 July 1863]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1863 to 1911 129° east was the WA/NToSA border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel

===1911–27===
In 1911 the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) was split off from South Australia to be administered by the Commonwealth. ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|1 January 1911 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 January 1911|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 January 1911]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1911 to 1927 129° east was the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1927–31===
In 1927 the Northern Territory was split into two territories, [[North Australia (territory)|North Australia]] (NA) and [[Central Australia (territory)|Central Australia]] (CA). ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|1 March 1927 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#1 March 1927|Territorial evolution of Australia – 1 March 1927]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1931 129° east was once again the WA/NA border and WA/CA border, both north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

===1931–present===
In 1931 North Australia and Central Australia were reunited as the Northern Territory.
([[Territorial evolution of Australia#12 June 1931|12 June 1931 – MAP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Territorial evolution of Australia#12 June 1931|Territorial evolution of Australia – 12 June 1931]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 to the present 129° east has been the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.

Fixing the position of the border of Western Australia on the ground has a rich history. In March 1920 the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]], [[H. B. Curlewis]] gave a talk at the WA Museum about the history of the determination of [[longitude]], in relation to using what was at that time a new technology, by using [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] to determine the position of the border between South Australia and Western Australia, as close to the 129th east meridian as possible.&lt;ref name="curlewis-talk"&gt;

Preliminary work on the border determinations began in November [[1920 in Australia|1920]] when the [[South Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis met at [[Deakin, Western Australia]] on the [[Trans-Australian Railway|East-West Trans-Australian Railway]].&lt;ref name="scientific-interest"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The other members of the party were Messrs. [[Clive Melville Hambidge]] and J. Crabb, of the Survey Department; Warrant Officer V. D. Bowen, in charge of wireless apparatus lent by the Defence Department; and Mr. C. A. Maddern, of the [[Adelaide Observatory]], all from Adelaide.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concrete piers for the astronomical observing instruments were erected in readiness for the final determinations that were to be held in 1921. Observations were made for the purpose of testing under field conditions the instruments and methods to be used in 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

This expedition, to determine 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved the cooperation of the [[Astronomer Royal]] and the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], with [[Time signal#Electrical time signals|wireless time signals]] sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the [[:fr:Observatoire de Lyon|Lyons astronomical observatory (Observatoire de Lyon)]] at [[Saint-Genis-Laval]], near [[Lyon, France|Lyons, France]], between 17 and 24 November 1920. Wireless time signals were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide sidereal clock to be used as a control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

After these initial tests a comprehensive program was then arranged for the second stage of the border determinations, which were to take place during the following year and dates were then set for that to happen, from 20 April to 10 May 1921.&lt;ref name="scientific-interest" /&gt;

=====Deakin Pillar=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
One of the concrete piers mentioned, which were cubic concrete blocks slightly smaller than a cubic metre, would later be named as the Deakin Pillar (1921), being from where the larger border marker, the Deakin [[Obelisk]] (1926), would be set out from.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

=====Deakin Obelisk=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
The Deakin Pillar is approximately 2.82&amp;nbsp;km west of the Deakin Obelisk. The Deakin Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of [[1926 in Australia|1926]] to 129° east.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Deakin Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisk, which determines, on the ground, the South Australian border with Western Australia by a line drawn south to the coastline of the [[Great Australian Bight]] and north through this point to 26° south.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

====WA/NT border marking history====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
Shortly after the [[1921 in Australia|1921]] determinations of the border of South Australia and Western Australia, the Government Astronomer for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis and party travelled by the [[State Shipping Service of Western Australia|State Ship]] Bambra to the port of [[Wyndham, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;

&lt;!-- Name the other party members? --&gt;
From Wyndham they were guided by [[Michael Durack|Michael Patrick (&amp;quot;M.P.&amp;quot;) Durack]] to a point he perceived as the northern boundary between his [[Argyle Downs]] Station and Jack Kilfoyle's Rosewood Station, which was also Western Australia's border with the Northern Territory or 129° east.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt; Most of Rosewood station is in the Northern Territory but some distance further south Rosewood also extends into the East Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

From the chosen position, two concrete pillars were erected similar to those described above and portable radio masts set up, before the determinations were carried out by the scientists using the same methods of wireless time signals as were used at Deakin.&lt;ref name="kimberley" /&gt;

=====Austral Pillar=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
One of the concrete pillars erected, which was the one used as the point of the determinations, was marked by the expedition party to show how far east of Greenwich they were in hours, minutes and seconds, and became known as the Austral Pillar.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Austral Pillar, the point selected for the scientific determinations of 1921 would later be found to be about 2&amp;nbsp;km east from the border of 129° east on that part of Rosewood Station, therefore inside the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

=====Kimberley Obelisk=====
&lt;!-- This title is used to link from other articles – please change all other references to this if changing the title --&gt;
The Kimberley Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of 1927 to 129° east. Over several weeks during [[1927 in Australia|1927]], a Western Australian [[Surveying|survey]] crew from the WA [[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia|Department of Lands and Surveys]] travelled to Wyndham, then to the Austral Pillar site to set out from that point to the border, where they then erected the much more substantial Kimberley Obelisk.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;

The Kimberley Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top of the concrete obelisk, which officially determines the WA/NT border on the ground, near 129° east, by a line drawn north to the northern coastline near the [[Joseph Bonaparte Gulf]] and south through this point at the Kimberley Obelisk to the 26th parallel.&lt;ref name=notstraight/&gt;
