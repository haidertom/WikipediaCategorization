==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

'''aaajiao''' （aka.Xu Wenkai） ({{zh|c= 徐文恺}}), is the online handle of Xu Wenkai,  a Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist, avid blogger and free thinker.

Born in 1984, aaajiao grew up in Xi’an, the ancient capital of Qin and Han Dynasty known for the Terracotta Army. The year of 1984, coinciding with [[George Orwell]]’s dystopian masterpiece, seems to explain the perfect alignment between the vivid SciTech-driven imagination and the sometimes-poetic sophistication, frequently seen as the main theme of aaajiao’s work. Many of aaajiao’s works tap into the most current trends of thoughts around the Internet sphere, with a focus on the emerging controversies and phenomenon related to data processing, blogsphere/wemedia and filtered information. In his most recent projects, the artist has adopted a more extended scope of practices, borrowing elements from architecture, electronic music, performance arts, product design, even medicine, to portray the young generation harnessing the power of cyber technology and the ever-present social media.

Being one of the most frequently exhibited Chinese new media artists, aaajiao has been featured in both international and domestic scenes. Highlights include: “Global Control And Censorship - [[ZKM]] | Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe(2015)”, The 2nd “CAFAM Future” Exhibition: Observer-Creator · The Reality Representation of Chinese Young Art Beijing, CAFA Art Museum (2015); Cosmos - Limited and Limitless, Existence and Co-existence Shanghai, 21st Century Minsheng Art Museum (2014),Thingworld - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2014),The West Bund Architecture and Contemporary Art Biennale, Shanghai (2013); “One World” Exposition – Chinese Art in the Age of the New Media, Videotage, TransLife: Media Art China 2011 - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2011),Hong Kong (2011); [[Transmediale]], Berlin (2010), etc. aaajiao is a winner of the Jury Prize from Art Sanya Awards 2014, a nominee of OCAT – Pierre Huber Art Prize, and most recently, a nominee of the “Young Artist of the Year” of 9th “Award of Art China”.

'''Ambivalence'''&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; is a state of having simultaneous conflicting reactions, beliefs, or feelings towards some object.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Collegiate Dictionary'', 3rd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = K.

Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent. The less certain an individual is in their attitude, the more impressionable it becomes, hence making future actions less predictable and/or less decisive.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=377|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence|date = March 16, 2010|accessdate = October 28, 2014|website = Psycholopedia|publisher = Psych-it.com.au|last = Moss|first = Dr. Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambivalent attitudes are also more susceptible to transient information (e.g., mood), which can result in a more malleable evaluation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = D. W. | last2 = Esses | first2 = V.

R. 1996" /&gt;

For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Types of attitudinal ambivalence ==

=== Felt ambivalence ===
The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  One, often called '''subjective ambivalence''' or felt ambivalence, represents the [[Subjective experience|psychological experience]] of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., &amp; Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103114000134|title = Wanting other attitudes: Actual-desired attitude discrepancies predict feelings of ambivalence and ambivalence consequences|author1=DeMarree K.G. |author2=Wheeler S.C. |author3=Brinol P. |author4=Petty R.E. |date = July 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2014.02.001|pmid =|volume=53|pages=5–18|hdl = 10486/666333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct [[self-report]] measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and Attitude Change: Attitudinal Ambivalence|author1=Conner M |author2=Armitage C.J. |publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = 261–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted ''of'' my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be [[Metacognition|metacognitive]]. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways.

Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced "no conflict at all") to 10 (as in the subject experienced "maximum conflict").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Potential ambivalence ===
Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called '''objective ambivalence''' or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present.

Kaplan initially operationalized ambivalence as the lesser of the two reactions (i.e., positive or negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).

&lt;u&gt;Kaplan's measure yields the formula&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = S+L - |S-L|=S&lt;/math&gt;

Here, S is representative of the smaller rating or reaction, and the L is representative of the larger rating or reaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/47/6/1191/|title = Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude|author= Breckler, Steven J.|date = 1984|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = November 12, 2014|doi =10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191 |pmid =|volume=47|issue = 6|pages=1191–1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three conditions are as follows:
# If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. 
# If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease.
# If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease.
&lt;u&gt;Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence= (S+L)/2-|S-L|&lt;/math&gt;

The creation of this formula was pivotal because it accounts for both subjective and objective ratings.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Predictors of felt ambivalence ===
Research has shown only a moderate [[correlation]] between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications (A Festschrift for Wolfgang Stroebe)|authors = Jonas, K., &amp; Ziegler, R.|publisher = Psychology|year = 2007|isbn = 9781135419745|location = |pages = 32–34|title-link = Wolfgang Stroebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness.

There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: ''simultaneous accessibility'' and ''preference for consistency''.

'''Simultaneous accessibility''' is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Preference for consistency''' uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.

== Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence   ==

=== One-dimensional perspective ===
Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional—from positive to negative—but given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a [[Love hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change|author1=Maio, Gregory |author2=Haddock, Geoffrey |publisher = Sage Publications Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-4129-2974-5|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect  how attitudes function and are experienced.

=== Two-dimensional perspective ===
The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual’s positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone.  These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models.

=== Multidimensional perspective ===
The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor.

Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however it should be noted that the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding
them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to “fire together” they  will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence.

=== Meta-cognitive model ===
Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that [[meta-cognition]] has to do with "knowing about knowing." The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The
meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement,
change, and strength. [[Attitude (psychology)|Social Cognition.]]Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.[[Attitude (psychology)|657-686]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consistency theories and ambivalence ==

=== Overview ===
Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the ''perceived ''[[paradoxical]] state itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Balance theory ===
[[Fritz Heider]] established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; [[balance theory]] seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. [[Triadic relation]]ships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement.

Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self ''(p)'', another person ''(o), ''and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus ''(x)''. According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved).

The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory ===
Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude.

“Ambivalence is a function of the ''amount of conflict'' within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the ''magnitude of the difference'' between evaluations.”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Attitudes |last= Albarracin |last2=Johnson |last3=Zanna |first= Dolores |first2=Blair |first3=Mark |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Mahwah, New Jersey|page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different.

The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative-cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in [[social psychology]] ever since. In 1957, [[Leon Festinger]] was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Concepts of Balance, Congruity, and Dissonance |last=Zajonc |first=Robert B. |author-link=Robert Zajonc |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |date=Summer 1960 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=280–296 |doi=10.1086/266949 |jstor=2746406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any ''two ''conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention.

Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/6/735.full.pdf+html|title = Feeling Conflicted and Seeking Information: When Ambivalence Enhances and Diminishes Selective Exposure to  Attitude-Consistent Information |authors=Sawicki, Wegener, Clark, Fabrigar, Smith, Durso |date=2013 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |doi=10.1177/0146167213481388 |pmid=23482502 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=735–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self-image.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to [[self-esteem]] evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance:
# Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition
# Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions
# Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition

== Motivation and information processing ==
As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so.

=== Heuristic-systematic model ===
Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano &amp; R. Prislin (Eds.), ''Attitudes and attitude change'' (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Antecedents of ambivalence ==

=== Behavioral indicators ===
Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).

&lt;u&gt;The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - |P-N|&lt;/math&gt;

Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, '''interpersonal ambivalence''', the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priester | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Petty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Park | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Whence univalent ambivalence? From the anticipation of conflicting reactions | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 11–21 | doi = 10.1086/513042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Individual differences ===
Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the [[need for cognition]], or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most.

Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Goal conflicts ===
Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves.

Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence
every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Harreveld | first1 = F. | last2 = van der Pligt | first2 = J. | last3 = de Liver | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The agony of ambivalence and ways to resolve it: Introducing the MAID model | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1177/1088868308324518 | pmid=19144904}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the "pleasure" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict.

Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009"/&gt;

=== Value conflicts ===
Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. [[Social constructs]] and perceived norms and [[values]] within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter.

Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur.

The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values.

=== Affective-cognitive ambivalence ===
Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of “''the heart vs. mind conflict.''”

When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress.&lt;ref name="Van Harreveld 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hass | first1 = R.

== Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength ==

=== Attitude stability ===
Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Krosnick, J. A., &amp; Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty &amp; J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), ''Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences'' (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ:  Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/26/11/1421.short|title = Attitudinal Ambivalence: A Test of Three Key Hypothesis|last = Armitage |last2=Conner|first =Christopher J. | first2= Mark |date = 2000|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |accessdate = November 3, 2014|doi =10.1177/0146167200263009 |pmid =|volume=26|issue = 11|pages=1421–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haddock | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Making a party leader less of a party member: The impact of ambivalence on assimilation and contrast effects in political party attitudes | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 769–780 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-9221.2003.00353.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Attitude pliability ===
Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may [[bias]] or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially "anchored in knowledge structures".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low-fat diet.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any.

In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Ambivalence in clinical psychology ==
=== Bleuler's tripartite scheme ===
The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article ''Vortrag über Ambivalenz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal | last=Bleuler |first=Eugen |authorlink=Eugen Bleuler |title=Vortrag über Ambivalenz |trans-title=Lecture on Ambivalence |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/gesch/ambiv-g.htm#Aus%20dem%20Zentralblatt%20f%C3%BCr%20Psychoanalyse%201,%201911,%20S. |journal=Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse [Central Journal for Psychoanalysis] |location=[[Bern]] |year=1910 |issue=1 |pages=266-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplanche |first1=Jean |last2=Pontalis |first2=Jean-Bertrand |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Ambivalence (pp. 26–28) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Ambivalence+Ambivalenz |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |page=[https://books.google.it/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Bleuler,+E.+%27Vortrag+iiber+Ambivalenz%27+(1910)%22 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 128n.&lt;/ref&gt; Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action—what [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] called "a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through [[Buridan's ass]], starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 81-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual ambivalence—the [[Philosophical scepticism|sceptical belief]] that "There is no reason but hath a contrary to it"&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, ''Essays Vol II'' (1938) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; —also follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to [[Sextus Empiricus]] and [[Pyrrho]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ed, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Freud]] considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the [[Splitting (psychology)|psychological splitting]] of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how "in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freudian usage ===
Freud was swift to pickup Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co-existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulse&lt;ref&gt;J. Bleger et al, ''Symbiosis and Ambiguity'' (2013) p.  261&lt;/ref&gt;—what Freud called "pairs of contrary component instincts" such as looking and being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning—something he thought to be a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leader, ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 61-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others in [[psychoanalysis]] have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 72-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include [[psychological repression]], [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 157 and p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, an [[analysand|analytic patient]]'s love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed—while his "hate" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis.  A [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the "high"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded ''imperative'', rather than as a behavioral ''choice'', complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.)

Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of "ambivalence" sees it as engendered by all [[neurosis|neurotic]] [[Emotional conflict|conflict]], a person's everyday "mixed feelings" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Ambivalence in philosophy==
Philosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Razinsky |first=Hili |title=Ambivalence.

Two popular proponents of the anti-aging movement include [[Ray Kurzweil]], who says humanity can defeat aging through the advance of [[technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chasing Immortality—The Technology of Eternal Life |author=Craig Hamilton |url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j30/kurzweil.asp |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606134650/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j30/kurzweil.asp |archivedate=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aubrey De Grey]], who says that the human body is a very complicated machine and thus, can be repaired indefinitely.&lt;ref name=SingularitySymposiumDeGray&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Aubrey de Grey?|url=http://www.singularitysymposium.com/aubrey-de-grey.html|website=Singularity Symposium|quote=Maybe it is because of his background in computer science that Dr. de Grey perceives the human body as a very complicated machine. Therefore, he argues that aging is primarily an engineering problem.

Levinson]]. However, figures in the [[gerontology]] community in 2003 tried to distance their research from the perceived pseudoscience of the movement.&lt;ref name=BinstockGerontologist2003WarOnAntiAging&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binstock|first1=Robert|title=The War on "Anti-Aging Medicine"|journal=The Gerontologist|date=2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=4–14|doi=10.1093/geront/43.1.4|url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/1/4.full|quote=Leading members of the gerontological community have recently launched a war on anti-aging medicine, seeking to discredit what they judge to be fraudulent and harmful products and therapies, and to distinguish their research from what they regard as the pseudoscience of the anti-aging movement.|pmid=12604740|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202050907/http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/1/4.full|archivedate=2015-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-aging medicine==
{{Main|Anti-aging medicine}}
Anti-aging medicine has become a budding and rapidly growing [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] as physicians who initially sought treatment for themselves have received training and [[Board certification|certification]] in its practice&lt;ref name=Mykytyn/&gt; by organizations such as the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M).

===Human growth hormone===

Central to anti-aging medicine is administration of [[human growth hormone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Klatz, ''Grow Young with HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan to Reverse Aging'' Harper Paperbacks (May 8, 1998), trade paperback, 400 pages {{ISBN|0-06-098434-1}} {{ISBN|978-0060984342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical studies have shown that low-dose growth hormone (GH) treatment for adults with GH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing [[muscle]] mass, decreasing fat mass, and increasing [[bone]] density and muscle strength. It also improves [[cardiovascular]] parameters (i.e. decrease of [[LDL cholesterol]]) and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexopoulou O, Abs R, Maiter D |title=Treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: who, why and how?

===Menopausal hormone drugs===
Administration of [[estrogen]] and other hormones such as [[progestin]] were popularized by the 1966 book ''Feminine Forever'' by Robert A. Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Wilson, ''Feminine Forever'', M. Evans and Company, Inc. (June 15, 1968), hardcover, {{ISBN|0-87131-049-X}} {{ISBN|978-0871310491}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase of the use of estrogen was shown to be associated with an increased risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=JickAJPH1980CancerEpidemicCommentary&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H Jick|author2=A M Walker|author3=K J Rothman|title=The epidemic of endometrial cancer: a commentary|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=March 1980|volume=70|issue=3|pages=264–267|doi=10.2105/AJPH.70.3.264|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.70.3.264|pmc=1619376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2002, research into the long-term effects of estrogen on post-menopausal women, the [[Women’s Health Initiative]], produced evidence that there were serious side effects.&lt;ref name=WHIPostmenopausalHormoneTrialResults&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings from the WHI Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Trials|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/|website=Women's Health Initiative|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617000903/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/|archivedate=2016-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians who prescribe the hormones now prescribe low doses of the drugs. Research into the long-term effects of hormone replacement therapy is continuing, with a 2017 [[Cochrane review|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] concluding that long-term use may decrease the risk of [[Bone fracture|bone fractures]] or [[postmenopausal osteoporosis]], but increase the risk of [[stroke]], [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=Marjoribanks2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marjoribanks|first=Jane|last2=Farquhar|first2=Cindy|last3=Roberts|first3=Helen|last4=Lethaby|first4=Anne|last5=Lee|first5=Jasmine|date=2017|title=Long-term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD004143|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004143.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28093732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hormone therapy is generally only recommended for postmenopausal women who are at a high risk of osteoporosis when non-hormonal treatments are not suitable.&lt;ref name=Marjoribanks2017 /&gt; Hormone therapy is not suitable or advised for treating cardiovascular disease, dementia, or for preventing cognitive decline in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=Marjoribanks2017 /&gt; The risks of long-term hormonal therapy for women under 50 years of age have not been determined.&lt;ref name="Marjoribanks2017" /&gt;

==Scientific approaches==
[[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontology]] is a scientific discipline which has the same area of interest but, as a branch of [[gerontology]], takes a more conservative approach.&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-aging science: The emergence, maintenance, and enhancement of a discipline" article by Jennifer R. Fishman, Robert H. Binstock, and Marcie A. Lambrix in ''Journal of Aging Studies'' Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 295-303 {{doi|10.1016/j.jaging.2008.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass movement==
A substantial fraction of older people, taking their cue from [[alternative medicine]], purchase and use [[herbal supplement]]s and other products which promise relief from the incidents and dangers of aging. Some products are not effective while others hold promise.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://bit.ly/1N88Sv5&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d011129.pdf 'Health Products for Seniors:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106233742/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d011129.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }} "Anti-Aging" Products Pose Danger for Physical and Economic Harm' report by the [[General Accounting Office|GAO]] September, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
There are at least two opposite views on the prospects of anti-aging research and development. One group states that there is a great deal of over-heated rhetoric in use with respect to [[life extension]] with over-optimistic projections on the part of its advocates. They also claim that there is little evidence that any significant breakthrough has been made, or is on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Leigh | authorlink = Leigh Turner | year = 2004 | title = Biotechnology, bioethics and anti-aging interventions | url = | journal = [[Trends in Biotechnology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 219–221 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.008 | pmid = 15109806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state that, this is largely due to a current lack of funding or interest in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivefuturist.com/archive/368.html |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318122344/http://positivefuturist.com/archive/368.html |archivedate=March 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the common supplements and hormone treatments used published in 2006 in the ''Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine'' showed that none of them are effective with respect to extending life.&lt;ref&gt;

Another group notices that recent scientific successes in rejuvenation and extending the lifespan of model animals (mice 2.5 times, yeast and nematodes 10 times)&lt;ref name=AgingResearchOpenLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging Research |url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429170735/http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |archivedate=2015-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} and discovery of variety of species (including humans of advanced ages) having [[negligible senescence]] give hope to achieve negligible senescence (cancel ageing) for younger humans, reverse ageing, or at least significantly delay it.

Though some scientists think curing aging is impossible, there are some criticisms of both the time frame life extensionists envision (the first, perhaps somewhat crude, treatments within the next several decades, or at least before the beginning of the 22nd century) and of whether curing aging is even desirable. Common criticisms of the idea of life extension are fears it will cause the world to be more [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]]; however De Grey counters that by saying that since [[menopause]] would also be delayed, women could wait longer to have children and thus, the rate of growth would actually ''decline'' as a result. Also, the slowly growing population would buy centuries of time to figure out new places to live, such as [[space colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilov, Rejuvenation Res. 2010 Apr; 13(2-3): 329–334.

'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;Gilman, T.T., Marcuse, F.L. and Moore, A.U., (1960). Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens. Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology, 43: 99-111&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in [[sharks]] exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"&gt;Henningsen, A.D., (1994).  Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry. Zoo Biology 13: 325-332. {{doi|10.1002/zoo.1430130406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.&lt;ref name="Jones 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watsky, M.A., and Gruber, S.H. (1990) Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 8: 207-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davie, P.S., Franklin, C.E., and Grigg, G.C. (1993) Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 12: 95-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, M.R., Dill, L.M., Marshall, G.J., and Buhleier, B. (2002) Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem. Marine Biology 140: 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, K.N., Wetherbee, B.M., owe, C.G., and Meyer, C.G. (1999) Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters. Marine Biology 134: 665-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. SCOPUS. Web. 22 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2 in: Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt; [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F.T. (1977) Induction and duration of tonic immobility. The Psychological Record 27: 89-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J.C. (1991) Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens. Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences 6: 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In marine mammals===
In 1997, it was reported that around the [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]], a female [[orca]] was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a [[great white shark]]. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.

Another case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with [[stingrays]] in [[New Zealand]]. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves.  This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Channel "The Whale That Ate Jaws" 11/29/2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.&lt;ref name="Prestrude"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.&lt;ref name="Hennig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rabbits===
In [[rabbit]]s, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing.&lt;ref name="McBride et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |doi= |url= http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013|display-authors=etal}} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name="McBride et al." /&gt;

===In humans===
Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While "freezing" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common "freeze" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/galliano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ Why many rape victims don’t fight or yell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning. Thus, defensive immobilization is hypothesized to have played a critical role in the evolution of human parent-child attachment&lt;ref name=Porges&gt;{{cite journal | author = Porges S W | year = 2003 | title =  Social engagement and attachment: a phylogenetic perspective | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1008 | issue = 1| pages = 31-47 | doi=10.1196/annals.1301.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sustained attention and suggestibility,&lt;ref name="Hoskovec, J., &amp; Svorad, D. 1969 pp. 180-182"&gt;{{cite journal | title= The relationship between human and animal hypnosis |year=1969 |last1=Hoskovec |first1=J |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=180-182 |last2=Svorad |first2=D |doi= 10.1080/00029157.1969.10402029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortez, C.

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.&lt;ref name="Gallup et al., 1970"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970). Effect of varying conditions of fear on immobility reactions in domestic chickens (Gallus gullus).  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 73: 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallup, 1979"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., (1979).  Tonic immobility as a measure of fear in the domestic fowl.  Animal Behaviour, 27: 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"&gt;Jones, B. and Faure, J.M. (1981). Tonic immobility ("righting time") in laying hens housed in cages and pens. Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;Forkman, B., Boissy, A. Meunier-Salaün, M.-C. Canali, E. and Jones, R.B., (2007). A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses.  Physiology &amp; Behavior, 92: 340-374&lt;/ref&gt;

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009"&gt;Zamudio, S.R., Quevedo-Corona, L., Garcés, L. and De La Cruz, F. (2009).  The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats.  Brain Research Bulletin, 80: 331-336&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"/&gt; hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels,&lt;ref name="Jones, 1987"&gt;Jones, R.B., (1987).  Fearfulness of caged laying hens: The effects of cage level and type of roofing.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 17: 171-175&lt;/ref&gt; hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor,&lt;ref name="Scott and Moran, 1993"&gt;Scott, G.B. and Moran, P., (1993).  Fear levels in laying hens carried by hand and by mechanical conveyors. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 36: 337-345&lt;/ref&gt; and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.&lt;ref name="Cashman et al., 1989"&gt;Cashman P., Nicol, C.J. and Jones, R.B. (1989).  Effects of transportation on the tonic immobility fear reactions of broilers. British Poultry Science, 30: 211-221&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with [[mice]],&lt;ref name="Bazovkina et al., 2011"&gt;Bazovkina D.V., Tibeikina M.A., Kulikov A.V. and  Popova, N.K., (2011).

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.&lt;ref name=Pasteur /&gt;

===For defense===
For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;Pasteur, G. (1982). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 A classificatory review of mimicry systems]". ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''13''': 169–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,&lt;ref name="beetle"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive? Heritable variation in fitness difference of death-feigning behaviour|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume = 271|pages = 2293–2296|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2858|pmid=15539355|last6=Mizumoto|first6=M|issue=1554|pmc=1691851|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&amp;id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways. Some biologists believe that many die as they feed on road-killed animals – a favorite food. Others believe that the opossums’ small brain (5 times smaller than that of a raccoon) suggests that they may just be too dumb to get out of the way of vehicles!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H. Leaich |year = 2006|title = Variation in propensity to exhibit thanatosis in ''Nasonia vitripennis'' (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)|journal = Journal of Insect Behaviour|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 241–249|doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9022-7|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.3100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cricket, ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nishino|first = H.|year = 2004|title = Motor output characterizing thanatosis in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal = Journal of Experimental Behaviour|volume =207|issue = 22|pages = 3899–3915|doi=10.1242/jeb.01220|pmid = 15472021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene S. Helfman |author2=Bruce B. Collette |author3=Douglas E. Facey |title =The diversity of fishes|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell|year =1997|page=324|isbn =978-0-86542-256-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKaye, K.R.

(1998) Darwin’s pond: Malawi and Tanganyika. Tropical Fish Hobbyist 47: 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid ''[[Parachromis friedrichsthalii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, M.

The '''aquatic ape hypothesis''' ('''AAH'''), also referred to as '''aquatic ape theory''' ('''AAT''') and more recently the '''waterside model''',&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attenborough|first1=David (2016)|title=The Waterside Ape|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07w4y98/episodes/player|website=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea that the ancestors of [[modern human]]s were more [[aquatic mammals|aquatic]] and as such were habitual waders, swimmers and divers. The hypothesis in its present form was proposed by the [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as [[shellfish]] on the sea shore and sea bed leading to [[adaptation]]s that explained significant characteristics such as man's functional hairlessness and [[bipedalism]].&lt;ref name="Hardy 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Alister|title=Was Man More Aquatic in the Past?|journal=New Scientist|date=17 March 1960|volume=7|issue=174|pages=642–45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qUi12M-fpMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was built upon by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], who added feminist criticism in opposition to the male image of the "mighty hunter" being presented in popular [[anthropological]] works by [[Robert Ardrey]] and others. While her 1972 book ''The Descent of Woman'' was very popular with the public, it attracted little attention from scientists and those who did comment complained that there was no way of testing hypotheses about soft body parts and human habits in the distant past.

Morgan removed the feminist content in several later books and her ideas were discussed at a 1987 conference devoted to the idea.{{sfn|Roede|1991}} Her 1990 book ''Scars of Evolution'' received some favorable reviews but the thesis was subject to scathing criticism from the anthropologist John Langdon in 1997, who characterized it as an "umbrella hypothesis" and argued that the hypothesis is not more [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] than simply [[Null hypothesis|rejecting the hypothesis]].{{sfn|Langdon|1997}}

The hypothesis remains highly controversial and is generally more popular with the lay public than with scientists.&lt;ref name=kmsma&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bender R, Tobias PV, Bender N |title=The Savannah hypotheses: origin, reception and impact on paleoanthropology |journal=Hist Philos Life Sci |volume=34 |issue=1–2 |pages=147–84 |year=2012 |pmid=23272598 |type=Historical article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of the mainstream academic community ignored or derided the initial proposal, academics in the last 15 years have conducted research at least in part inspired by AAH.&lt;ref&gt;Milam, Erika (2013).

==History==
{{Human timeline}}
The German [[pathologist]] [[Max Westenhöfer]] (1871–1957) discussed in 1942 various human characteristics ([[Body hair#Evolution of less body hair|hairlessness]], [[Subcutaneous tissue#Subcutaneous fat|subcutaneous fat]], the regression of the [[olfaction|olfactory organ]], [[Webbed fingers or toes|webbed fingers]], direction of the [[body hair]] etc.) that could have derived from an aquatic past, quoting several other authors who had made similar speculations. As he did not believe human beings were [[apes]], he believed this might have been during the [[Cretaceous]], contrary to what is possible given the geologic and evolutionary biology evidence available at the time.{{sfn|Westenhöfer|1942|p=148}} He stated: "The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Westenhöfer|first=Max|title=Der Eigenweg des Menschen. Dargestellt auf Grund von vergleichend morphologischen Untersuchungen über die Artbildung und Menschwerdung |year=1942|pages=309–312|publisher=Verlag der Medizinischen Welt, W. Mannstaedt &amp; Co. |location=Berlin|ref=harv |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/eigenweg-des-menschen-dargestellt-auf-grund-von-vergleichend-morphologischen-untersuchungen-uber-die-menschwerdung-und-artbildung/oclc/311692900 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2 May 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Westenhöfer Max (1948) ''Die Grundlagen meiner Theorie vom Eigenweg des Menschen: Entwicklung, Menschwerdung, Weltanschauung''. Carl Winter Heidelberg. {{ISBN|978-3533019695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of Westenhöfer's writings, the [[marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] had since 1930 also hypothesized that humans may have had ancestors more aquatic than previously imagined, although his work, unlike Westenhöfer's, was rooted in the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] consensus. On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FGRH%2FGRH59_01%2FS0016672300030184a.pdf&amp;code=d17034fd127cba9b1d84a553e6b92ef1 Reeve, Eric. Book review: "The Aquatic Ape: Fact or Fiction?" (PDF)]. ''Genetical Research'' (Cambridge University Press), Volume 59 Issue 01 (February 1992): p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hardy|1960}} After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] in [[Brighton]] on 5 March 1960. Several national newspapers reported sensational presentations of Hardy's ideas, which he countered by explaining them more fully in an article in ''[[New Scientist]]'' on 17 March 1960: "My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, [[shell fish|shellfish]], [[sea urchin|sea-urchins]] etc., in the shallow waters off the coast."{{sfn|Hardy|1960}}

The idea was generally ignored by the [[scientific community]] after the article was published. Some interest was received, notably from the geographer [[Carl Sauer]] whose views on the role of the seashore in human evolution&lt;ref name=Sauer1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1960 |title=Seashore–Primitive home of man? |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=41–7 |jstor=985209|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "stimulated tremendous progress in the study of coastal and aquatic adaptations" inside [[marine archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erlandson|first=J. M.|year=2001|title=The archaeology of aquatic adaptations: paradigms for a new millennium|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=9|issue=4|pages=287–350|ref=harv|doi=10.1023/a:1013062712695}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in ''[[The Naked Ape]]'', a popular book by the zoologist [[Desmond Morris]], who reduced Hardy's phrase "more aquatic ape-like ancestors" to the bare "aquatic ape", commenting that "despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support".&lt;ref name=Morris1967&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Desmond |title=The Naked Ape |year=1967 |page=29 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-09-948201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional descriptions of 'savage' existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing and hunting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Lewis H|title=Ancient Society|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientsocietyo00morggoog|accessdate=29 October 2016|year=1877|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co|location=New York|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dart|first=Raymond A. |year=1953|title=The Predatory Transition from Ape to Man|journal=International Anthropological and Linguistic Review|volume=v. 1|issue=4|url=http://www.users.miamioh.edu/erlichrd/350website/classrel/dart.html|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hunting was the focus of the [[screenwriter]] [[Robert Ardrey]]'s 1961 best-seller ''[[African Genesis]]''. Another screenwriter, Elaine Morgan, responded to this focus in her 1972 ''Descent of Woman'', which parodied the conventional picture of "the Tarzanlike figure of the prehominid who came down from the trees, saw a grassland teeming with game, picked up a weapon and became a Mighty Hunter,"{{sfn|Morgan|1972|p=11}} and pictured a more peaceful scene of humans by the seashore. She took her lead from a section in Morris's 1967 book which referred to the possibility of an ''Aquatic Ape'' period in evolution, his name for the speculation by the biologist [[Alister Hardy]] in 1960. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–''The Aquatic Ape'' (1982), ''The Scars of Evolution'' (1990), ''The Descent of the Child'' (1994) and ''The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis'' (1997)–which explored the issues in more detail.

==The Hardy/Morgan hypothesis==
Hardy's hypothesis as outlined in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' was:
:My thesis is that a branch of this primitive [[ape]]-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, [[shell fish]], [[sea urchin|sea-urchins]] etc., in the shallow waters off the coast. I suppose that they were forced into the water just as we have seen happen in so many other groups of terrestrial animals. I am imagining this happening in the warmer parts of the world, in the tropical seas where Man could stand being in the water for relatively long periods, that is, several hours at a stretch.&lt;ref name="Hardy 1960"/&gt;
Hardy argued a number of features of modern humans are characteristic of aquatic adaptations. He pointed to human's lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in certain other marine mammals, such as the [[whale]] and the [[hippopotamus]],{{sfn|Morgan|1990|pp=69-79}}&lt;ref name="Langdon 1997, p. 483"&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; and noted the layer of [[subcutaneous fat]] humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Man_s_place_among_the_mammals.html?id=mYI3AAAAIAAJ |last=Wood Jones|first=Frederic|title=Man's Place among the Mammals|accessdate=4 February 2017 |year=1929 |publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; co.|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional features cited by Hardy include the location of the [[trachea]] in the [[throat]] rather than the nasal cavity, the human propensity for front-facing [[copulation]], [[tears]] and [[eccrine sweating]], though these claimed pieces of evidence have alternative evolutionary adaptationist explanations that do not invoke an aquatic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rnGLp3QMiJYC|title=From Mating to Mentality: Evaluating Evolutionary Psychology|last=Sterelny|first=Kim|last2=Fitness|first2=Julie|date=2004-03-01|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9781135432126|location=|pages=250|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy additionally posited that [[bipedalism]] evolved first as an aid to [[wading]] before becoming the usual means of human locomotion,{{sfn|Hardy|1960}}&lt;ref&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open [[shellfish]].{{sfn|Hardy|1960|p=645}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their [[#Related academic and independent research|research programs]].

Morgan summed up her take on the hypothesis in 2011:
:Waterside hypotheses of human evolution assert that selection from wading, swimming and diving and procurement of food from aquatic habitats have significantly affected the evolution of the lineage leading to ''Homo sapiens'' as distinct from that leading to ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781608052448/chapter/51560/ |last1=Kuliukas|first1=Algis V.|first2=Elaine |last2=Morgan|year=2011|title=Aquatic Scenarios in the Thinking on Human Evolution: What are they and How do they Compare?|pages=106–119|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[File:AAT Confer 3.jpg|thumb|Aquatic Ape Conference delegates in Valkenburg, 1987]]
Academics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic [[anthropology]]) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis. Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at [[Valkenburg (city)|Valkenburg]], [[Netherlands]] in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the theory and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of [[Oxford University]]. His summary at the end was:{{quote|Overall, it will be clear that I do not think it would be correct to designate our early hominid ancestors as 'aquatic'. But at the same time there does seem to be evidence that not only did they take to water from time to time but that the water (and by this I mean inland lakes and rivers) was a habitat that provided enough extra food to count as an agency for selection.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1991&gt;{{cite book | last=Reynolds| first=Vernon | title=Cold and Watery?

===Critiques===
The AAH has received little attention from mainstream anthropologists and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]]. It is not accepted as empirically supported by the scholarly community,&lt;ref name="Dunsworth2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunsworth, H.M. |title=Human Origins 101 |page=121 |year=2007|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | isbn=978-0-313-33673-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0juhJgGco5QC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNeill&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=D |year=2000 | title=The Face: A Natural History |pages=36–37 |isbn=0-316-58812-1 |publisher=Back Bay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcOvIc-LP_IC&amp;pg=PA36 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trauth&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Trauth | first1=M.

In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an "umbrella hypothesis" and argued that the [[Falsifiability|difficulty of ever disproving]] such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a [[parsimonious explanation]], it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the [[null hypothesis]] that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the "umbrella" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper [[scientific hypothesis]]. Langdon also objected to Morgan's blanket opposition to the "[[savannah hypothesis]]" which he took to be the "collective discipline of paleoanthropology". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal. In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in [[soft tissue]] anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils. After a brief description of the issues under 26 different headings, he produced a summary critique of these with mainly negative judgments. His main conclusion was that the AAH was unlikely ever to be disproved on the basis of comparative anatomy, and that the one body of data that could potentially disprove it was the fossil record.{{sfn|Langdon|1997}}

Anthropologist [[John D. Hawks]] wrote that it is fair to categorize the AAH as [[pseudoscience]] because of the social factors that inform it, particularly the personality-led nature of the hypothesis and the unscientific approach of its adherents.&lt;ref name="hawks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/pseudoscience/aquatic_ape_theory.html|title=Why anthropologists don't accept the Aquatic Ape Theory|authorlink=John D. Hawks|date=4 August 2009|type=Blog post|author=Hawks JD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical anthropologist [[Eugenie Scott]] has described the aquatic ape hypothesis as an instance of "crank anthropology" akin to other pseudoscientific ideas in anthropology such as alien-human interbreeding and [[Bigfoot]].&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Quacks and cranks, GMOs and climate, science and philosoph&amp;mdash;CFI Conference covers it all|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/reason_for_change_quacks_and_cranks_gmos_and_climate_science_and_philosophy|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=39|issue=5|page=12|author=Frazier K|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|accessdate=Feb 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution'' (2013), the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain. He nevertheless criticized the AAH because "it's always a problem identifying features [such as body fat and hairlessness] that humans have now and inferring that they must have had some adaptive value in the past." Also "it's notoriously hard to infer habits [such as swimming] from anatomical structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUp5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=115|title=The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution|last=Gee|first=Henry|publisher=U of Chicago Press|year=2013|page=115|ref=harv|accessdate=6 January 2017|isbn=9780226044989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the AAH has become an embarrassment to some anthropologists who want to explore the effects of water on human evolution without engaging with the AAH, which they consider "emphasizes adaptations to deep water (or at least underwater) conditions". Foley and Lahr suggest that "to flirt with anything watery in paleoanthropology can be misinterpreted", but argue "there is little doubt that throughout our evolution we have made extensive use of terrestrial habitats adjacent to fresh water, since we are, like many other terrestrial mammals, a heavily water-dependent species." But they allege that "under pressure from the mainstream, AAH supporters tended to flee from the core arguments of Hardy and Morgan towards a more generalized emphasis on fishy things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta Mirazón|year=2014|title=The Role of "the Aquatic" in Human Evolution: Constraining the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=56–59 |last1=Foley|first1=Robert|doi=10.1002/evan.21405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Waterside Ape", a pair of 2016 BBC Radio documentaries, [[David Attenborough]], discussed a "move towards mainstream acceptance” for the AAH in the light of new research findings. Scientists interviewed included Kathlyn Stewart and Michael Crawford who had published papers in a special issue of the ''Journal of Human Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Human Evolution'' Volume 77, Pages 1-216 (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; on "The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior".&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt; Responding to the documentaries in a newspaper article, paleoanthropologist [[Alice Roberts]] dismissed the AAH as a distraction "from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex" and that it had become "a theory of everything" that is simultaneously "too extravagant and too simple".&lt;ref&gt;"It's time we let go of the 'aquatic ape' myth."

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], in his discussion of evolutionary philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvRqtnpVotwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Darwin%27s+Dangerous+Idea#v=onepage&amp;q=Darwin's%20Dangerous%20Idea&amp;f=false|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=Penguin|year=1995|page=244|accessdate=4 February 2017|isbn=9780684824710}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented
"During the last few years, when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleoanthropologists and other experts, I have often asked them to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic theory. I haven’t yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have also wondered the same thing." He challenged both Elaine Morgan and the scientific establishment in that "Both sides are indulging in adapt[at]ionist [[Just-so story|Just So stories]]". Along the same lines, historian [[Erika Lorraine Milam]] noted that independent of Morgan's work, certain standard explanations of human development in paleoanthropology have been roundly criticized for lacking evidence while being based on sexist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Scientists. Routes to Innovation in Biology|last=Milam|first=Erika|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|editors=Oren Harman &amp; Michael R Dietrich|chapter=Dunking the Tarzanists. Elaine Morgan and the Aquatic Ape theory|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy lecturer [[Bruce Charlton]] gave Morgan's book ''Scars of Evolution'' an enthusiastic review in the [[British Medical Journal]] in 1991, calling it "exceptionally well written" and "a good piece of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Bruce|date=5 January 1991|title=How the apes lost their fur|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=302|issue=6767|pages=58|doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6767.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, paleoanthropologist [[Phillip Tobias]] declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity's precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenberg conference were no longer valid. Tobias praised Morgan's book ''Scars of Evolution'' as a "remarkable book" though he said that he did not agree with all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tobias |first=Philip|title=Foreword: Evolution, Encephalization, Environment |page=viii}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010|pp=vii-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tobias |first=Philip V |year=1998 |title=Water and Human Evolution |journal=Dispatches Human Evolution |url=http://users.ugent.be/~mvaneech/outthere.htm |accessdate=16 January 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man's precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of [[Lamarck]], and followed by Darwin, [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], well before Raymond Dart used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Savannah Hypotheses: Origin, Reception and Impact on Paleoanthropology| first1=Renato |last1=Bender |first2=Phillip V. |last2=Tobias|first3=Nicole |last3= Bender | journal=Hist.

=== Reactions of Hardy and Morgan ===
Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines "Oxford professor says man a sea ape", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=12}} As he later said to his ex-pupil [[Desmond Morris]], "Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn't a proven fact. And of course we're not related to dolphins."&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt;

Elaine Morgan's 1972 book ''Descent of Woman'' became an international best-seller, a [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] selection in the [[United States]] and was translated into ten languages.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=15}} Part of this was related to the growing [[women's liberation movement]] as Morgan's work was inspired by a feminist critique of then-standard anthropological ideas. She assumed that the total lack of response to her book from the academic community was due to the fact that she was an outsider. "The response I had not foreseen was total silence. But in respect of the aquatic theme that is what I got from them - and with few exceptions still get. That kind of silence is a virtually unbeatable strategy".{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=17}} Morgan removed the feminist critique and rewrote the scientific text, publishing it as ''The Aquatic Ape'' ten years later, but it did not garner greater reaction from scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/may/13/aquatic-ape-elaine-morgan-history-science|title=Elaine Morgan and the Aquatic Ape|last=Milam|first=Erika Lorraine|date=2013-05-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the general reaction to Hardy and Morgan's proposals was silence by the relevant academic community, there have been over the last decades some academics who were inspired by AAH proposals, even to the point of pursuing particular lines of research on its basis. Some of the academics and professional scientists who have supported the AAH include Michael Crawford, Professor and Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition at [[Imperial College London]], his former postdoctoral researcher, Stephen Cunnane, now professor of medicine at [[Université de Sherbrooke]], Erika Schagatay, professor of Environmental Physiology at [[Mid Sweden University]], Kathlyn M. Stewart, Section Head of [[Palaeobiology]] at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], and Tom Brenna, Professor of Paediatrics and Chemistry at [[University of Texas]].

===Wading and bipedalism===
After reviewing 30 different explanations of bipedalism, evolutionary biologist [[Carsten Niemitz]] proposed a "shore dweller" hypothesis of wading, though distancing himself from the AAH.&lt;ref name=newsynth&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00114-009-0637-3 |last=Niemitz |first=Carsten |year=2010 |title=The evolution of the upright posture and gait—a review and a new synthesis |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0637-3 |accessdate=4 February 2017 |ref=harv|bibcode=2010NW.....97..241N|pmc=2819487 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Niemitz C |authorlink=Carsten Niemitz |title=A Theory on the Evolution of the Habitual Orthograde Human Bipedalism – The "Amphibische Generalistentheorie" |journal= Anthropologischer Anzeiger |volume=60 |pages=3–66 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Niemitz |first=Carsten |authorlink=Carsten Niemitz |title=Das Geheimnis des Aufrechten Gangs ~ Unsere Evolution Verlief Anders |year=2004 |publisher=Beck |isbn=3-406-51606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He records 10 monkey and ape species, including chimpanzees and gorillas, who have been observed wading on two feet.{{sfn|Niemitz|2010|pp=254,5}} Niemitz's hypothesis places the wading bipedalism of hominids as occurring in the late [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=newsynth /&gt; Other researchers, including AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking [[orthograde posture]] with using fully upright posture. Although it is harder to walk upright with bent knees on land, this difference gradually diminishes as the depth of water increases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuliukas |first1=Algis V |first2=Nick |last2=Milne |first3=Paul |last3=Fournier |year=2009 |title=The relative cost of bent-hip bent-knee walking is reduced in water |journal=Journal of Comparative Human Biology |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=479–488 |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still practical in thigh-high water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halsey|first1=Lewis G |first2=Christopher J |last2=Tyler |first3=Algis V |last3=Kuliukas |year=2014 |title=The energy costs of wading in water |journal=Biology Open |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=571 |doi=10.1242/bio.20147831 |pmid=24907372 |pmc=4154292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critique of the AAH, [[Henry Gee]] questioned any link between bipedalism and diet. Gee writes that early humans have been bipedal for 5 million years, but our ancestor's "fondness for seafood" emerged a mere 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2013/may/07/aquatic-apes-creationism-evolution|title=Aquatic apes are the stuff of creationism, not evolution|last=Gee|first=Henry|date=2013-05-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food sources, nutrients, and brain size===
[[File:Sapiens neanderthal comparison en blackbackground.png|thumb|Neanderthal skull (right) compared with modern human]]

In their 1989 book ''The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future'', Michael Crawford together with co-author David Marsh wrote about the connections they saw between nutrition and human evolution, and in particular claimed that Omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain.{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989}} "A branch of the line of primitive ancestral apes was forced by competition to leave the trees and feed on the seashore. Searching for oysters, mussels, crabs, crayfish and so on they would have spent much of their time in the water and an upright position would have come naturally."{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989|p=162}} Crawford and Marsh argued that the norm of brain size seen in small and aquatic mammals is similar to humans and they further opine that other primates and carnivores had lost relative brain capacity (though the relationship between brain size and intelligence is not isomorphic).{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989|p=159}} Reviewing their book for the ''New Scientist'', biologists Caroline Pond and Dick Colby were highly critical, saying that the work provided "no significant new information that would be of interest to biologists" and that its style was "speculative, theoretical and in many places so imprecise as to be misleading."&lt;ref name="pond"&gt;{{cite journal|date=27 January 1990|title=''The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future'' by Michael Crawford and David Marsh|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014-300-the-fats-of-evolution-review-of-the-driving-force-evolution-and-the-future-by-michael-crawford-and-david-marsh/|journal=New Scientist|type=Book review|vauthors=Pond C, Colby D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Crawford, "the evolution of a large brain on the savannahs of Africa was impossible. The only way it could have happened was with the resources of the marine food-web which initiated the growth and development of the brain in the first place".&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt; A group of evolutionary nutritionists and paleontologists led by Cunnane, Stewart, and Crawford published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their "shore-based diet scenario",{{sfn|Cunnane|Stewart|2010}}{{sfn|Stewart|Cunnane|Tattersall|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival of the fattest: the key to human brain evolution|last=Cunnane|first=SC|publisher=World Scientific|year=2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan's thesis as a foundation work of their model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cunnane|first2=Stephen C.|year=2010|title=Introduction|pages=xiii–xvii|ref=harv|last1=Stewart|first1=Kathlyn M.}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe problems in landlocked communities as being supportive of AAH, with reports of [[cretinism]] in the Alps since the 18th century and widespread [[goitre]]s in parts of Africa, which is only prevented by the addition of iodine to diets.{{sfn|Broadhurst|Wang|Crawford|Cunnane|2002|pp=659-660}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venturi|first=Sebastiano and Michel E. Bégin|year=2010|title=Thyroid Hormone, Iodine and Human Brain Development|page=112}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010|pp=105–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cunnane, "Without the availability of iodized table salt, non-coastal (inland) habitats do not provide foods rich enough to meet human iodine requirements."{{sfn|Cunnane|2010|p=47}} Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in ''[[Homo]]'' as early as the Pliocene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun|first1= David R.|first2=John W.

C.|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What has been lacking has been the paleontological evidence that early humans consumed fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago.{{sfn|Stringer|Andrews|2005}} Part of the problem has been the avoidance of [[Taphonomy#Taphonomic biases in the fossil record|taphonomic bias]] by researchers: most hominin fossils occur in marginal [[Lacustrine deposits|lacustrine]] environments and the presence of fish remains is therefore no proof of fish consumption. Fish bones often decompose so that special tests are required to detect them.{{sfn|Stewart|2010}} The archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to [[postglacial]] [[Past sea level|sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erlandson |first=Jon M. |title=Food for Thought: the Role of Coastlines and Aquatic Resources in Human Evolution}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010|pp=125–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diving behavior and performance===
Aside from working as a professor, Schagatay is also an experienced [[Scuba diving|scuba]] and [[Freediving|freediver]] whose research centers around human diving abilities. She suggests that such abilities are consistent with selective pressure for underwater foraging during human evolution, and discussed other anatomical traits speculated as diving adaptations by Hardy/Morgan.&lt;ref name="schagatay_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781608052448/chapter/51561/ |last=Schagatay |first=E. |title=Human Breath-Hold Diving Ability Suggests a Selective Pressure for Diving During Human Evolution|pages=120–147 |year=2011}} in {{harvnb|Vaneechoutte|Kuliukas|Verhaegen|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Langdon suggested that such traits could be enabled by a human [[developmental plasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon| first=J.| title=Book review of 'Was Man More Aquatic in the Past?

===Vernix caseosa===

A 2016 research programme conducted by Tom Brenna (then at [[Cornell University]]), with the help of Judy St Leger at [[SeaWorld San Diego|San Diego Seaworld]], compared the chemistry of vernix on human neonates and samples of a vernix-like substance on California Sealion pups. They established that its molecular composition is comparable to human vernix, being rich in both branch chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and squalene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenna|first1=Tom|title=Sea Lions Develop Human-like Vernix Caseosa Delivering Branched Fats and Squalene to the GI Tract|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25871-1|website=Scientific Reports|publisher=Nature|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Reproductive technology}}
'''Artificial reproduction/propagation''' is the creation of new life by other than the natural means available to an [[organism]]. Examples include [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization]], [[cloning]] and embryonic splitting, or [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]].

Cutting plants' stems and placing them in [[compost]] is also a form of artificial reproduction.
We can grow many plants from one plant by using the man-made methods. The process of growing many plants from one plant by man-made methods is called artificial propagation of plants. A number of methods of artificial propagation of plants are used in agriculture (for raising crops), and horticulture (cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers). The three common methods for the artificial propagation of plants are:
# Cuttings,
# Layering, and
# Grafting.

We will now describe all these methods, one by one. Let us start with the cuttings method for the artificial propagation of plants.

== Layering ==
In this method, a branch of the plant is pulled towards the ground and a part of it is covered with moist soil leaving the tip of the branch exposed above the ground. After some time, new roots develop from the part of the branch buried in the soil. The branch is then cut off from the parent plant. The part of the branch which has developed roots grows to become a new plant (just like the parent plant). Jasmine plant (chameli) is propagated or produced by the layering method.

We can see from that one left side branch and one right side branch of the parent jasmine plant have been buried in moist soil. The parts of branches which are buried in soil grow their own roots. When this happens, the branches of the parent plant connecting the newly formed plants are cut off so that the newly formed plants may grow on their own and develop into mature plants (like the parent plant).

Many plants like strawberry and raspberry are propagated by the natural layering method. The natural layering occurs because these plants form runners (which are soft horizontal stems running above the ground). Wherever the ends of such runners touch the ground, new plants are formed at those places. In this way, many more strawberry or raspberry plants are formed from" the parent plant in a natural way.

The layering method is used for the propagation (or reproduction) of plants like : Jasmine, Strawberry, Raspberry, Lemon, Guava, Hibiscus (China rose), Bougainvillea and many slender ornamental plants.Example: Nerium

== Grafting ==
Grafting is a method in which the cut stems of two different plants   are joined together in such a way that the two stems join and grow as a single plant. This new plant will have the 
characteristics of both the original plants.


The cutted stem of a plant  having roots and fixed in the soil is called ''stock''. Stock is the lower part of a plant having the roots.The cutted stem of another plant without  is called 'scion'. Scion is the upper part of a plant which may have leaves on it .

In carrying out grafting, two plants  are chosen which are to be used as scion and stock. First, the stem (or branch) is removed from the plant chosen to be made scion (for its desirable characteristics) by making a slanting cut. This gives us the scion with a slanting cut. The stem of second plant (or tree) to be used in grafting is also cut in a slanting way. The lower part of this plant (or tree) is stock. It has also a slanting cut.

The scion is placed over the stock. The cut surfaces of the scion and stock are fitted together and bound tightly with a piece of cloth and covered properly with polythene sheet (so as to prevent harmful infection by bacteria or fungus, and loss of water and plant sap from the cut and joined ends of stock and scion).

While joining the scion to the stock, care should be taken to make sure that the cambium layer of scion is in contact with the cambium layer of stock (because the cambium layer in the stem is responsible for growth).

The cut soon heals and the stock and scion of two plants grow together and become one plant. The scion continues to produce its original leaves, flowers and fruits but it gets water and minerals for making food from the chosen stock. So, the fruits will have the characteristics of both the plants (from which scion and stock have come).

Grafting is used to breed fruit trees and flowering bushes. Apple, peach, apricot and pear trees are often grafted. We will now describe some of the advantages of the grafting method of artificial propagation.
# Grafting enables us to combine the most desirable characteristics of the two plants (scion and stock) in its flowers and fruits.
# By grafting method, a very young scion (shoot part of a plant) .can be made to flower and produce fruits quite fast when it is grafted to the stock (stem having roots) of a mature plant.
# It enables us to obtain flowers and fruits having . Many varieties of mango have been produced by grafting method.
 Grafting can be used to produce varieties of seedless fruits. Some examples of such plants which are reproduced by artificial vegetative propagation methods are: Banana, Pineapple, Orange, Grape, Rose etc.

A '''cosmology episode''' is a sudden loss of meaning, followed eventually by a transformative pivot, which creates the conditions for revised meaning.

In the wake of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War]], the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]], the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal chemical disaster]], and the relatively sudden insertion of [[personal computers]] into the workplace, organizational scholar [[Karl E. Weick]] coined the term "cosmology episode," as follows, in 1985:

"Representations of events normally hang together sensibly within the set of assumptions that give them life and constitute a 'cosmos' rather than its opposite, a 'chaos.'  Sudden losses of meaning that can occur when an event is represented electronically in an incomplete, cryptic form are what I call a 'cosmology episode.'  Representations in the electronic world can become chaotic for at least two reasons:  The data in these representations are flawed, and the people who manage those flawed data have limited processing capacity.  These two problems interact in a potentially deadly vicious circle."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1985.  Cosmos vs. Chaos:  Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts.  Organizational Dynamics, 14 (Autumn): 50-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cosmology episodes evolved significantly between 1985 and 1993, when Weick published his now-classic reanalysis of [[Norman Maclean]]'s study of the [[Mann Gulch fire|Mann Gulch wildland firefighting disaster]] in 1949.  In the 1993 article, Weick positions cosmology episodes within a [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] [[ontology]], he links the term to a variety of similar concepts, and he provides a better-developed definition than he was able to provide in 1985.

First, Weick makes it clear that cosmology episodes occur within a constructivist ontology of the world, rather than the more familiar [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] and [[subjectivist]] ontologies:

"The basic idea of [[sensemaking]] is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs....  Sensemaking emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others.  Thus, in the words of Morgan, Frost, and Pondy (1983: 24), "individuals are not seen as living in, and acting out their lives in relations ''to'', a wider reality, so much as creating and sustaining images of a wider reality, in part to rationalize what they are doing.  They realize their reality by 'reading into' their situation patterns of significant meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Weick clarifies the key phrase "sudden loss of meaning" by linking it to related ideas described by other organizational scholars:

"Minimal organizations, such as we find in the crew at Mann Gulch, are susceptible to sudden losses of meaning, which have been variably described as fundamental surprises (Reason, 1990) or as events that are inconceivable (Lanir, 1989), hidden (Westrum, 1982), or incomprehensible (Perrow, 1984).  Each of these labels points to the low probability that the event could occur, which is why it is meaningless.  But these explanations say less about the astonishment of the perceiver, and even less about the perceiver's inability to rebuild some sense of what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Weick expands his 1985 definition -- "sudden losses of meaning"—to a more nuanced description:

"Cosmology refers to a branch of philosophy often subsumed under metaphysics that combines rational speculation and scientific evidence to understand the universe as a totality of phenomena.  Cosmology is the ultimate macro perspective, directed at issues of time, space, change, and contingency as they relate to the origin and structure of the universe.  Integrations of these issues, however, are not just the handiwork of philosophers.  Others also must make their peace with these issues, as reflected in what they take for granted.  People, including those who are smokejumpers, act as if events cohere in time and space and that change unfolds in an orderly manner.  These everyday cosmologies are subject to disruption.  And when they are severely disrupted, I call this a cosmology episode (Weick, 1985: 51-52).  A cosmology episode occurs when people suddenly and deeply feel that the universe is no longer a rational, orderly system."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catastrophic Cosmology Episodes ==
Building on Weick's 1993 definition of cosmology episodes, Weick, his colleagues, and other researchers have advanced knowledge of best practices during cosmology episodes at four levels of analysis:  (1) catastrophic cosmology episodes, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001 and the Haitian earthquake of 2010; (2) disastrous cosmology episodes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina; (3) contextualized cosmology episodes occurring within specific domains, such as the 1976 Three Mile Island nuclear system incident and the 1970 [[Apollo 13]] space system incident; and (4) everyday cosmology episodes, such as transition of leaders at the top of an organization and the introduction of new technologies throughout an organization.

The study of cosmology episodes is distinct from the study of high-reliability organizations because the concept directs explicit attention to the integral role of human spirituality during catastrophic events—as the threatened entity (what now is my role in the universe?), the source of inspiration/improvisation (what now am I able to do to respond to the event?), and the re-established entity (what now is my different role in the universe?).  Consequently, the topic of cosmology episodes lends itself to study by researchers within two small academic organizations—the American Psychological Association's Division 36 (Psychology of Religion and Spirituality) and the Academy of Management's MSR Division (Management, Spirituality, and Religion).

== Disastrous Cosmology Episodes ==
A 2016 article titled "Cosmology Episodes:  A Reconceptualization," Doug Orton and Kari O'Grady identified three taxonomies that they found helpful in studying 164 citations of the term "cosmology episode" on Google Scholar.  One taxonomy was based on level of analysis (nation, community, organization, team, and individual).  One taxonomy was based on five resilience processes (anticipating, sense-losing, improvising, sense-remaking, and renewing).  The third taxonomy -- of interest here -- is level of intensity of the cosmology episode (catastrophe, disaster, crisis, ancillary, and metaphorical).  Communications researchers tend to be more present in the study of community disasters; management researchers tend to be more present in the study of organizational crises.  Importantly, though, it is possible for a community-level cosmology episode to be catastrophic (e.g. Hurrican Katrina), disastrous (e.g the Red River floods of 1997), a crisis (e.g. the 22 July 2005 Stockwell Subway Shooting), ancillary (e.g. an e coli epidemic for a food company), and metaphorical (e.g. the introduction of new technology in an Italian courtroom).

'''''Creatures 2''''' is the second game in the [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]] [[artificial life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]], and the sequel to 1996 game ''[[Creatures (artificial life series)|Creatures]]''. It features three species: the cute, dependent [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Norns]], the cantankerous [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Grendel]]s and the industrious [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Ettins]]. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in.  The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.

Many new gameplay features included in Creatures 2 not present in the original game include a new [[physics]] model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the Creatures 1 world.

The [[executable]] file for the game was in fact an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for its scripting [[Programming language|language]], thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== Gameplay ==
Like the other games in the series, Creatures 2 is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]] cavern area. The [[hatchery]], one of the game's in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported into to use in the game.

Once Norns reach [[adolescence]] at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an [[oestrogen]] cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end – known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder's Kit.

At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area.

Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just "agent" for short. Many user-created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity  to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them.

Albia, the world in which Creatures 2 is set, is a vast disc-world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as [[bee]]s which pollinate [[flower]]s and create [[honey]], and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct.

Albia also has four seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Winter]] and [[Autumn]], and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen [[thermometer]], allowing the player to monitor Albia's temperature at all times.

== Development ==
Creatures 2's release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original Creatures had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The "Early Adoption Program", a promotion where 250 copies of Creatures 2 were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date.

Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed "One Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)", which caused Norns to forgot basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the Creatures community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the Creatures 2 team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers.

Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|last=|first=|date=2017-12-05|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 Oct 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
CryptoKitties is not a [[cryptocurrency]]. Instead it operates on [[Ethereum]]'s underlying blockchain network, as a [[Non-Fungible Tokens|non fungible token (NFT)]] unique to each CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is unique and owned by the user, validated through the blockchain, and its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties cannot be replicated and cannot be transferred without the user's permission even by the game developers. Users can interact with their CryptoKitties, having the ability to buy, sell, and sire (breed) them. A test version of CryptoKitties was unveiled at ETH Waterloo on October 19, 2017, the largest Ethereum [[hackathon]] in the world. As of December 2, 2017, Genesis, the first and highest selling cat was sold for 246.9255 [[Ethereum|ETH]] (~$117,712 USD) on that day.

The virtual cats are breedable and carry a unique number and 256 bit distinct genome with DNA and different attributes (cattributes) that can be passed to offspring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html|title=Meet CryptoKitties, the $100,000 digital beanie babies epitomizing the cryptocurrency mania|last=Cheng|first=Evelyn|date=2017-12-06|work=CNBC|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several traits can be passed down from the parents to the offspring. These include pattern, mouth (shape), fur, eye shape, base color, accent color, highlight color, eye color, and optional wild and environment characteristics.

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that ''CryptoKitties'' would be spun off into its own company and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors.

== Technology ==

A CryptoKitties' ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. CryptoKitties are distributed automatically, via smart contract, at the rate of one every 15 minutes (672 per week) for one year. Each CryptoKitty is represented in the form of a non-fungible ERC-721 token, which allows for each entity to have specific cattributes.

Based on the limited number of cats going into circulation and their limited genomes, there is a limit of 4 billion total cats that can be bred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each cat will have a distinct visual appearance ("phenotype") determined by its immutable genes ("genotype") stored in the smart contract. Because cats are tokens on a blockchain, they can be bought, sold, or transferred digitally, with strong guarantees of ownership. A CryptoKitty does not have a permanently assigned gender. While they can only engage in one breeding session at one time, each cat is able to act as either matron or sire. The owner chooses with each breeding interaction.

A group known as Axiom Zen innovation studio developed the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/cryptokitties-quickly-becomes-most-widely-used-ethereum-app|title=CryptoKitties Mania Overwhelms Ethereum Network's Processing|date=2017-12-04|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until November 2018, Axiom Zen intends to continually release a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the rest of supply determined by breeding of CryptoKitties. CryptoKitty owners may put them up for sale via an auction for a price set in Ether (ETH).

== Reception ==
There are concerns that ''CryptoKitties'' is crowding out more serious, significant business that use the Ethereum platform. As of December 5, 2017 Etherscan has reported a sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum since the game's release just a week earlier. "''CryptoKitties'' has become so popular that it's taking up a significant amount of available space for transactions on the Ethereum platform", said Garrick Hileman, from the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties cripple Ethereum blockchain|date=2017-12-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to ''CryptoKitties'', which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[Latin]] phrases '''''De mortuis nihil nisi bonum''''' and '''''De mortuis nil nisi bene [dicendum]''''' ("Of the dead, [say] nothing but good") indicate that it is socially inappropriate to speak ill of the dead. As a mortuary [[aphorism]], ''De mortuis. . . .'' derives from the Latin sentence ''[[wikt:de#Latin|De]] [[wikt:mortuus#Latin|mortuis]] [[wikt:nil#Latin|nil]] [[wikt:nisi#Latin|nisi]] [[wikt:bonus#Latin|bonum]] [[wikt:dico#Latin|dicendum]] [[wikt:sum#Latin|est]]'' ("Of the dead nothing but good is to be said"), which also is abbreviated as '''''Nil nisi bonum'''''. Freer translations into English are often used as aphorisms, these include: "Speak no ill of the dead", "Of the dead, speak no evil", and "Do not speak ill of the dead".

The first recorded use of the phrase of mortuary respect dates from the 4th century, published in the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (ca. AD 300), Book 1, Chapter 70, by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], wherein the Greek aphorism ''τὸν τεθνηκóτα μὴ κακολογεῖν'' (''tòn tethnekóta mè kakologeîn'', "Do not speak ill of the dead") is attributed to [[Chilon of Sparta]] (ca. 600 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. In the 15th century, during the [[Italian Renaissance]], the [[Humanism|humanist]] monk [[Ambrogio Traversari]] translated Diogenes’s Greek book into Latin, as ''Laertii Diogenis vitae et sententiae eorum qui in philosophia probati fuerunt'' (1433), and so popularized ''De mortuis nihil nisi bonum'', the Latin aphorism advising respect for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traversari|first=Ambrogio|title=Laertii Diogenis vitae et sententiae eorvm qvi in philosophia probati fvervnt|year=1432|publisher=Impressum Venetiis per Nicolaum Ienson gallicum|location=Venice|url=http://library.lib.asu.edu/record=b1922627~S3|authorlink=Ambrogio Traversari|editor=Benedictus Brognolus|accessdate=12 May 2013|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  ''[[The Last Chronicle of Barset]]'' (1867), by [[Anthony Trollope]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After the sudden death of the Bishop's wife, the Archdeacon describes ''De mortuis'' as a proverb "founded in humbug" that only need be followed in public and is unable to bring himself to adopt "the namby-pamby every-day decency of speaking well of one of whom he had ever thought ill."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*  ''[[The Power-House]]'' (1916), by [[John Buchan]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After destroying the villain, Andrew Lumley, the hero, Sir Edward Leithen, speaks ''De mortuis &amp; c.'', an abbreviated version of the phrase, about the dead Lumley.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To the implicit, honour-saving offer, Stevenson replies, “Certainly, I am concerned with justice in this matter, not with politics.”

The next day, Professor Ormsby defenestrates himself from his rooms at [[Cambridge University]], and Commander Stevenson returns to his life on the [[River Dart]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Murder Must Advertise]]'' (1933), by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] &lt;blockquote&gt; About the dead man, two characters speak; the first asks: “What sort of chap was Dean?” . . .

* ''[[Busman's Honeymoon|Busman’s Honeymoon]]'' (1937), by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]

&lt;blockquote&gt; About the dead man, two characters speak; the first, Mr Puffett, says: “They’re takin’ Mr. Noakes away” . . . “It’s a good thing Mr. Noakes ain’t alive to see all that ’eap of coal. That’s a fire as does credit to any chimney.”

Hearing steps on the path, and seeing a dismal little procession passing the window: a sergeant of police and another uniformed man, carrying a stretcher between them . . . Mr. Puffett glanced from the window and removed his bowler hat: “And where’s all ’is cheeseparin’ brought ’im now?” he demanded.

The second man, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], says: “Nowhere . . . ''De mortuis''” and then some . . . Yes, he seems to be getting a nice derangement of epitaphs, poor old creature.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' (1952), by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. &lt;blockquote&gt; An engineer, Dr. Paul Proteus, recalls the phrase ''de mortuis'' in relation to fellow workers who committed a social ''faux pas'' during the annual social gathering; they would not be invited for the next year’s gathering.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* “De Mortuis” (1942), by [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]]. &lt;blockquote&gt; After an unwitting cuckold is accidentally informed of his wife’s infidelities, he plans an opportunistic revenge; the titular phrase, ''de mortuis'', implies the murderous ending of the story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* "[[EPICAC (short story)|EPICAC]]", by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After the demise of his friend/project - EPICAC, the supercomputer, the protagonist states the phrase in a memoir of someone who has done great for him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Poetic====
[[Image:Adam Lindsay Gordon - Melbourne monument.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The bush poet and balladeer Adam Lindsay Gordon, Melbourne.]]
* In “Sunlight on the Sea” (The Philosophy of a Feast), by [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]], the mortuary phrase is the penultimate line of the eighth, and final, stanza of the poem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
We eat and drink, we come and go,
(The sunlight dies upon the open sea.)
I speak in riddles. Is it so?
My riddles need not mar your glee;
For I will neither bid you share
My thoughts, nor will I bid you shun,
Though I should see in yonder chair
Th’ Egyptian’s muffled skeleton.
One toast with me, your glasses fill,
Aye, fill them level with the brim,
''De mortuis, nisi bonum, nil!''
The lights are growing dim.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem, “Sunlight on the Sea” (The Philosophy of a Feast), is in the collection, ''Sea Spray and Smoke Drift'' (1876).

* In “The Open Grave”, by [[Louise Glück|Louise Elisabeth Glück]], the mortuary phrase is repeated as a framing cadence.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
My mother made my need,
my father my conscience.
''De mortuis nil nisi bonum''.

Therefore it will cost me
bitterly to lie,
to prostrate myself
at the edge of a grave.

I say to the earth
“be kind to my mother,
now and later.
Save, with your coldness,
the beauty we all envied."

I became an old woman.
I welcomed the dark
I used so to fear.
''De mortuis nil nisi bonum''.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem, “The Open Grave”, is in the collection, ''Vita Nova'' (1999).

[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|175px|In ''Thoughts for the Times on War and Death'' (1915), Sigmund Freud denounced the cultural stupidity that was the First World War (1914–18); yet, in the essay “Our Attitude Towards Death”, recognised the humanity of the participants, and the respect owed them in the mortuary phrase ''De mortuis nil nisi bene''.]]

===Philosophic===
* The psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] mentions the phrase in ''[[Thoughts for the Times on War and Death]]'' (1915), in the second part of the essay, “Our Attitude Towards Death”, wherein he said:

{{Quotation|We assume a special attitude towards the dead, something almost like admiration for one who has accomplished a very difficult feat. We suspend criticism of him, overlooking whatever wrongs he may have done, and issue the command, ''De mortuis nil nisi bene'': we act as if we were justified in singing his praises at the funeral oration, and inscribe only what is to his advantage on the tombstone. This consideration for the dead, which he really no longer needs, is more important to us than the truth, and, to most of us, certainly, it is more important than consideration for the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=Our Attitude Towards Death|url=http://www.bartleby.com/282/2.html|website=Thoughts for the Times on War and Death|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cinematic===
* In the war–adventure film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) &lt;blockquote&gt; The phrase is cautiously used at the funeral of [[T. E. Lawrence]], officiated at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]; two men, a clergyman and a soldier,  Colonel Brighton, are observing a bust of the dead “Lawrence of Arabia”, and commune in silent mourning.

The clergyman asks: “Well, ''nil nisi bonum''. But did he really deserve . . . a place in here?”

Colonel Brighton’s reply is a pregnant silence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theatrical===
* In ''[[The Seagull]]'' (1896), by [[Anton Chekhov]], a character mangles the mortuary phrase.   &lt;blockquote&gt; In Act 1, in an effort at light [[metaphor]],  the bourgeois character Ilya Afanasyevich Shamrayev, misquotes the Latin phrase ''Nil nisi bonum'' and conflates it with the [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''[[De gustibus non est disputandum]]'' (“About taste there is no disputing”), which results in the mixed mortuary opinion: ''De gustibus aut bene, aut nihil'' (“Let nothing be said of taste, but what is good”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chekhov | first = Anton | authorlink = Anton Chekhov |author2=Stephen Mulrine, Translator | title = The Seagull | publisher = Nick Hern Books Ltd | year = 1997 | location = London | pages = Introduction, p. xvii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0VmB4tPlnIAC&amp;pg=PR17 | isbn = 978-1-85459-193-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Death education''' is [[education]] about [[death]] that focuses on the [[human]] and [[emotional]] aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with [[grief]] is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as [[thanatology]]. Thanatology stems from the Greek word ''thanatos'', meaning death, and ''ology'' meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;   A specialist in this field is referred to as a [[thanatologist]]. 
Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people that are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is a taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up to others. With the right education of death, the less of a taboo it will be.

==History==
Historically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] (1969), and [[Cicely Saunders]] (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death."&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 2002, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospice==
One of the major organizations that educates people on death is [[Hospice]]. Hospice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospice Foundation of America |url=http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |accessdate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311105852/http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |archivedate=11 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death.
Hospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. "With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life".  The end of a person's life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead.

==Curriculum==
Students of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and one's emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of Dying==
in her book, In Death and Dying (1969), Elisabeth Kubler-Ross proposed the five stages of the dying process. Though her work has often been referred to as the "five stages of grief," the original work was based on her clinical observations of the psychosocial responses of terminally ill patients to their impending death. Much scholarly debate has surrounded the legitimacy of her five "stages"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Experienced psychosocial clinicians have largely rejected the accuracy of the model because it addresses only emotional states, sets up false expectations of the process, and have not been empirically verified as a descriptive model.

The first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation.  This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts.
The second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges.
The third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again you'll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like:
•	"If only we had sought medical attention sooner…"
•	"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…"
•	"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…"

All of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one.
The fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life.
The fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died.

==Summary==
Even though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. "Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

'''''Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''''' is a 2007 book written by [[Aubrey de Grey]], a biomedical gerontologist, with his research assistant Michael Rae. ''Ending Aging'' describes de Grey's proposal for eliminating aging as a cause of debilitation and death in humans, and restoring the body to an [[Indefinite lifespan|indefinitely]] youthful state, a project plan that he calls the "[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]]", or "SENS". De Grey argues that defeating aging is feasible, possibly within a few decades, and he outlines steps that can be taken to hasten the development of  [[regenerative medicine]] treatments that will save lives.

According to contemporary theories of consciousness, the brain is the basis of [[subjectivity|subjective experience]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], and [[awareness]] of the surrounding [[nature|natural world]]. When [[brain death]] occurs, all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. Many people who believe that death is a permanent cessation of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the [[reticular activating system]] or the [[thalamus]], appear to be [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] for consciousness, because [[disorders of consciousness|damage to these structures]] or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness.

Through a naturalist analysis of the [[mind]] (an approach adopted by many philosophers of mind and neuroscientists), it is regarded as being dependent on the brain, as shown from the various effects of brain damage.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience and the soul"&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==
The English word "oblivion" (late 14c.) comes from the [[Old French]] ''oblivion'' (13c.) and directly from the [[Latin]] ''oblivionem'', meaning "forgetfulness; a being forgotten", which also comes from the word ''oblivisci'' ("to forget").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oblivion|title=oblivion - Origin and meaning of oblivion by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:wikt:oblivion|Oblivion]] itself means "state of being forgotten".

==Oblivion and subjectivity==
Thomas W. Clark, founder of Center for Naturalism, wrote a paper titled "Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |title=death |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208055953/http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |website=www.naturalism.org |archivedate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He critiqued what he saw as a flawed description of eternal oblivion as a "plunge into darkness". When some imagine their deaths (including the non-religious), they project themselves into a future [[self]] which experiences an eternal silent darkness. This is wrong, because without consciousness, there is no awareness of [[space]] and no basis for [[time]]. For Clark, in oblivion there isn't even an absence of experience, as we can only speak of experience when a subjective self exists.

According to [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Giulio Tononi]], consciousness is "all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self and the entire world dissolve into nothingness."&lt;ref name="pmid19098144"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
[[Steven Pinker]] explains the following in the seminar Is Science Killing the Soul, a discussion with [[Richard Dawkins]] presenting evidence against the existence of [[soul]]s. He elaborates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/richard_dawkins-steven_pinker-is-science-killing-the-soul|title=Is science killing the soul?|date=4 July 1999|first=John|last=Brockman|website=Edge|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Many kinds of evidence show that the mind is an entity in the physical world, part of a causal chain of physical events. If you send an electric current through the brain, you cause the person to have a vivid experience. If a part of the brain dies because of a blood clot or a burst artery or a bullet wound, a part of the person is gone — the person may lose an ability to see, think, or feel in a certain way, and the entire personality may change. The same thing happens gradually when the brain accumulates a protein called beta-amyloid in the tragic disease known as [[Alzheimer's]]. The person — the soul, if you want — gradually disappears as the brain decays from this physical process. We know that every form of mental activity — every emotion, every thought, every percept — gives off electrical, magnetic, or metabolic signals that can be recorded with increasing precision by [[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and other techniques. We know that if you look at the brain under a microscope, it has a breathtaking degree of complexity — on the order of a trillion synapses — that's fully commensurate with the breathtaking complexity of human thought and experience. We know that when the brain dies, the person goes out of existence."

==Physics and death==
In his book ''The Big Picture'', physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] asserts that through physics we can demonstrate that death is equivalent to eternal oblivion. He writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean M. |title=The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself |year=2016 |publisher=Penguin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x21qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=9780698409767 |p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "There is a much more profound implication of accepting the Core Theory as underlying the world of our everyday experience. Namely: there is no life after death. We each have a finite time as living creatures, and when it's over, it's over. The reasoning behind such a sweeping claim is even more straightforward than the argument against [[telekinesis]] or [[astrology]]. If the particles and forces of the Core Theory are what constitute each living being, without any immaterial soul, then the information that makes up "you" is contained in the arrangement of atoms that makes up your body, including your brain. There is no place for that information to go, or any way for it to be preserved, outside your body. There are no particles or fields that could store it and take it away."

== In philosophy ==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}
In the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (written by [[Plato]]), after [[Socrates]] is sentenced to death, he addresses the court. He ponders the nature of death, and summarizes that there are basically two opinions about it. The first is that it is a [[Metempsychosis|migration of the soul]] or [[consciousness]] from this existence into another, and that the souls of all previously deceased people will also be there. This excites Socrates, because he will be able to conduct his [[Socratic method|dialectic inquiries]] with all of the great [[Greek hero cult|Greek heroes]] and thinkers of the past. The other opinion about death is that it is oblivion, the complete cessation of consciousness, not only unable to feel but a complete lack of awareness, like a person in a deep, dreamless sleep. Socrates says that even this oblivion does not frighten him very much, because while he would be unaware, he would correspondingly be free from any pain or suffering. Indeed, Socrates says, not even the great King of Persia could say that he ever rested so soundly and peacefully as he did in a dreamless sleep.

[[Cicero]], writing three centuries later in his treatise ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute|On Old Age]]'', in the voice of [[Cato the Elder]], similarly discussed the prospects of death, frequently referring to the works of earlier Greek writers. Cicero also concluded that death was either a continuation of consciousness or cessation of it, and that if consciousness continues in some form, there is no reason to fear death; while if it is in fact eternal oblivion, he will be free of all worldly miseries, in which case he should also not be deeply troubled by death.

Similar thoughts about death were expressed by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] in his first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' and by the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]] in his ''Letter to Menoeceus'', in which he writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html|title=Epicurus - Letter to Menoeceus|first=Vincent|last=Cook|website=www.epicurus.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~phltso/deathfrags.html|title=Epicurus and Lucretius against the dear of death|website=www2.gsu.edu|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore, a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer."

Paraphrasing philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], Keith Augustine and Yonatan I. Fishman note that "the greater the damage to the brain, the greater the corresponding damage to the mind. The natural extrapolation from this pattern is all too clear — obliterate brain functioning altogether, and mental functioning too will cease".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlRuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 books.google.com], Augustine &amp; Fishman, 2015, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Youth and Time 1901.jpg|thumb|''Youth and Time'', [[John William Godward]], 1901]]

'''Eternal youth''' is the concept of human physical [[immortality]] free of [[ageing]]. The [[youth]] referred to is usually meant to be in contrast to the depredations of aging, rather than a specific age of the human lifespan. Achieving eternal youth so far remains beyond the capabilities of scientific technology. However, much research is being conducted in the sciences of genetics which may allow manipulation of the aging process in the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Eternal youth is common in mythology, and is a popular theme in [[fiction]].

==Religion and mythology==
Eternal youth is a characteristic of the inhabitants of [[Paradise]] in [[Abrahamic religion]]s.

The Hindus believe that the Vedic and the post-Vedic rishis have attained immortality, which implies the ability to change one's body's age or even shape at will. These are some of the [[siddha]]s in [[Yoga]]. [[Markandeya]] is said to always stay at the age of 16.

The difference between eternal life and the more specific eternal youth is a recurrent theme in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The [[mytheme]] of requesting the boon of immortality from a god, but forgetting to ask for eternal youth appears in the story of [[Tithonus]]. A similar theme is found in [[Ovid]] regarding the [[Cumaean Sibyl]].

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Iðunn]] is described as providing the gods [[apple]]s that grant them eternal youthfulness in the 13th century [[Prose Edda]].

==Telomeres==
An individual's [[DNA]] plays a role in the aging process. Aging begins even before birth, as soon as cells start to die and need to be replaced. On the ends of each [[chromosome]] are repetitive sequences of DNA, [[telomeres]], that protect the chromosome from joining with other chromosomes, and have several key roles. One of these roles is to regulate cell division by allowing each cell division to remove a small amount of genetic code. The amount removed varies by the cell type being replicated. The gradual degradation of the telomeres restricts cell division to 40-60 times, also known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. Once this limit has been reached, more cells die than can be replaced in the same time span. Thus, soon after this limit is reached the organism dies. The importance of telomeres is now clearly evident: lengthen the telomeres, lengthen the life.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

However, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 761–768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x | pmid = 21518243 | pmc=3387546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in a some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cherif H, Tarry JL, Ozanne SE, Hales CN | year = 2003 | title = Ageing and telomeres: a study into organ- and gender-specific telomere shortening | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–1583 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg208 | pmid = 12595567 | pmc=149817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23–74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renault V, Thornell LE, Eriksson PO, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V | year = 2003 | title = Regenerative potential of human skeletal muscle during aging | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 132–139 | pmid = 12882343 | doi=10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyapalan JC, Ferreira M, Sedivy JM, Herbig U | year = 2007 | title = Accumulation of senescent cells in mitotic tissue of aging primates | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 36–44 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2006.11.008 | pmid = 17116315 | pmc=3654105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.

Studies have shown that 90 percent of [[cancer]] cells contain large amounts of an [[enzyme]] called [[telomerase]].&lt;ref name="Damm"/&gt; Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes the worn away telomeres by adding bases to the ends and thus renewing the telomere. A cancer cell has in essence turned on the telomerase gene, and this allows them to have an unlimited amount of divisions without the telomeres wearing away. Other kinds of cells that can surpass the Hayflick limit are [[stem cells]], [[hair follicles]], and [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="Hornsby"/&gt; This is because they contain raised amounts of telomerase.

==Therapy==
The idea that the human body can be repaired in old age to a more youthful state has gathered significant commercial interest over the past few years, including by companies such as [[Human Longevity Inc]], [[Google Calico]], and [[Elysium Health]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition to these larger companies, many startups are currently developing therapeutics to tackle the 'ageing problem' using therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esthechoc: Scientists invent 'anti-ageing' chocolate|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/esthechoc-scientists-invent-antiageing-chocolate-10060075.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Alkahest inks a $50M deal for anti-aging R&amp;D|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/startup-alkahest-inks-50m-deal-anti-aging-rd/2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a new class of drugs [[senolytics]] was announced (currently in pre-clinical development) designed specifically to combat the underlying biological causes of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Senolytic" Drugs Can Dramatically Increase Healthy Lifespan|url=http://io9.com/new-senolytic-drugs-can-dramatically-increase-healthy-1690827868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The "loss of youth" or ageing process is responsible for increasing the risk of individuals to many diseases including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's]], and others. As a result, in recent years, many high net worth individuals have donated large amounts of their money towards initiatives towards scientific research into the ageing process itself or therapies to slow or reverse the ageing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT Scientist Claims That This Pill Is the Fountain of Youth|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|date=August 23, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people include [[Peter Thiel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel embarks on anti-aging crusade|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/08/billionaire-peter-thiel-may-want-to-live-forever/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=terview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD|url=http://www.lef.org/magazine/2013/7/Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD/Page-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Ellison]], [[Sergey Brin]], [[Dmitry Itskov]], [[Paul Gallen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Tech Billionaires Are Determined to Buy Their Way Out of Death |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-immortality-2013-8?IR=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Zuckerberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-zuckerberg-brin-life.html|title=Zuckerberg, Brin join forces to extend life|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow humans to extend or maintain their youth indefinitely.

'''''Evolution''''' is a collection of short stories that work together to form an episodic [[science fiction]] novel by author [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]].  It follows 565 million years of human evolution, from [[shrewlike]] mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity (and its descendants, both biological and non-biological) 500 million years in the future.

==Plot summary==
The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving [[Purgatorius]] into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) [[New World]] on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on [[Antarctica]].

The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become [[Sapience|sapient]], and go on to develop technology, including an evolving [[universal assembler|universal constructor]] machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of [[global ecophagy]]  consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. [[Human extinction]] (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet.  (The [[extinction-level event]] that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the [[Rabaul caldera]], coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in ''Evolution'' are ponderous Romans, sapient [[dinosaur]]s, the last of the wild [[Neanderthal]]s, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, [[symbiotic]] primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. The final chapter witnesses the final fate of the last primate and the descendants of the replicator machines sent to [[Mars]] that are implied to have reached sentience and colonized the galaxy.
In the epilogue, Joan Useb (a paleontologist introduced in the prologue and in the intermission sections) discusses the philosophy of evolution with her daughter Lucy as they weather the aftermath of Rabaul on the [[Galapagos]], where [[Charles Darwin]] made his observations leading to his landmark theory.

==Reception==
[[Peter Cannon]] reviewing for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "here is a rigorously constructed hard SF novel where the question is not whether humanity will reach the stars but how it will survive its own worst tendencies."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=January 20, 2003|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 3|pages=61|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called this novel "glum, dyspeptic, and depressing."&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 15, 2002|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume= 70|issue= 22,|pages=1662|issn=0042-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Cassada said in her review for ''[[Library Journal]]'' that "spanning more than 165 million years and encompassing the entire planet, Baxter's ambitious saga provides both an exercise in painless paleontology and superb storytelling."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie |date=February 15, 2003|title=Evolution (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 3|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evolution'' has been compared to [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Last and First Men]]'' and Baxter has acknowledged Stapledon's influence.&lt;ref name="AberrantDreams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd-image.com/interviews/myles_cabot_07.htm|title=An Interview with Stephen Baxter|work=Aberrant Dreams|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population.

By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|aging population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12952">'''Indefinite lifespan''' (also known as indefinite life extension or bio-indefinite) is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement and [[transhumanism]] to refer to the hypothetical longevity of humans (and other life-forms) under conditions in which [[ageing]] is effectively and completely prevented and treated.  Their lifespans would be "[[Wikt:indefinite|indefinite]]" (that is, they would not be "[[Wikt:immortal|immortal]]"), because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival. Such individuals would still be susceptible to [[death]] by disease, [[starvation]], accidents, or deliberate killing, but not death from aging.  Semantically, "indefinite lifespan" is more accurate than "[[immortality]]" which, especially in religious contexts, implies an inability to die.

== Longevity escape velocity ==
[[File:Longevity Escape Velocity.png|thumb|right|380px|“The first 1000-year-old is probably only ~10 years younger than the first 150-year-old”]]
{{main|Longevity escape velocity}}

[[Longevity escape velocity]] is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement.  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being increased faster than time is being expended.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than that year took away by passing by.

==Not immortality==
The terms "[[immortality]]" and "[[eternal youth]]" are often used as synonyms for "indefinite lifespan", but they carry connotations from their other contexts which science has deemed to be impossible. That is, ''immortal'' means "incapable of dying". ''Eternal'' implies guaranteed existence for [[eternity]], and in this context is also implausible because of [[entropy]]. Even if cures were found for all the degenerative diseases, and effective treatments were developed for all the processes of aging, so that bodies could be maintained as easily as cars can be repaired, people would still be killed in [[accident]]s, slain in [[war]]s, [[suicide|choose]] to die, etc.

The term indefinite lifespan represents a more achievable state of affairs, because it merely implies freedom from death by aging or infirmity.

The use of the term is also sometimes favored for reasons of linguistic aesthetics, in the same way that the term [[birth control]] is preferred to "''birth prevention''" or "''birth elimination''" which both imply, as does 'immortality', that the choice is one-time only and has permanent consequences.  Whereas the point of 'indefinite lifespan', like the point of 'birth control', is to gain the opportunity to lead one's life in a more conscious and deliberate manner.

==Probability==
This question is twofold. On the one hand it can be interpreted to mean, "Will a cure (or program of effective treatments) for aging ever be developed?" while on the other hand it could mean "Will the effective treatment of aging become available soon enough for those alive today to take advantage of it?" The answer to the first question is conditional on medical advancement: if medical science continues to advance in the fields of [[biogerontology]] and [[bioengineering]], then some people hope the answer is "yes, that it will happen eventually, except if some event or series of events were to prevent the further advance of biological science" (''see'' [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] ''and the'' [[Doomsday Clock]]). Many scientists researching this area at the moment do not agree. They see a problem in not just individual diseases but in failure of repair mechanisms alluded to above in the discussion of thermodynamic considerations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While science is constantly advancing and technology is becoming ever more sophisticated, the human body and mind are only evolving very slowly, and the aging process has not, in that time, become any more damaging (''which, in short, is why we live three times as long on average in the twenty-first century as we did ten thousand years before'').&lt;ref&gt;Cairns J (1997). “Matters of Life and Death” Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. (see pages 8-13) {{ISBN|9780691002507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the second question depends on two factors: the first being ''how fast'' medical science advances, and the second being ''how well'' each person takes care of themself (such as utilizing the best available [[life extension]] technology or not, and generally eating and behaving in a healthful and non-degrading way), both of which may affect whether or not a given person is still alive when the cure (or set of treatments) becomes available. This strategy is captured in the subtitle "Live Long Enough to Live Forever" of the life extension book ''Fantastic Voyage'', by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Terry Grossman]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The second factor to the second question hinges on the first factor - no amount of healthy living will enable somebody alive today to reach the point of indefinite lifespan if medical science is curtailed significantly, or if aging turns out to be massively more complex than currently believed. However, if biomedical gerontology continues to improve, if somatic [[Genetic engineering#Gene therapy|genetic engineering]] becomes safe and effective (and is not banned by opponents) within the relatively near future, it may be conceivable for some of those now alive to attain indefinite lifespans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Proposed techniques==

[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]] is a proposed research program for repairing all types of age-related damage.

On the theory that the primary cause of aging is DNA damage [see [[DNA damage theory of aging]] and [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]], there are, in principle, two ways of reducing DNA damage in cells, and thus allowing indefinite extension of lifespan. These are:
# Preventing the occurrence of DNA damage, and
# Repairing the DNA damage after it has occurred.

There is a large body of literature on antioxidant phytochemicals that reduce the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage. However, when intervention trials were carried out using these antioxidants as dietary supplements and cancer as the endpoint, the results generally proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Andrew R. |title=Antioxidant intervention as a route to cancer prevention |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=41 |issue=13 |pages=1923–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16111883 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Christina D. |title=Antioxidants and prevention of gastrointestinal cancers |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=195–200 |year=2013 |pmid=23274317 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835c9d1b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there seems to be evidence that certain dietary components stimulate repair of DNA damage, and protect against cancer as an endpoint. One of these is [[chlorogenic acid]], a major component of, and absorbable from, coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Del Rio |first1=Daniele |last2=Stalmach |first2=Angelique |last3=Calani |first3=Luca |last4=Crozier |first4=Alan |title=Bioavailability of Coffee Chlorogenic Acids and Green Tea Flavan-3-ols |journal=Nutrients |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=820–33 |year=2010 |pmid=22254058 |pmc=3257704 |doi=10.3390/nu2080820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is protective against colorectal cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Guowei |last2=Ma |first2=Defu |last3=Zhang |first3=Yumei |last4=Zheng |first4=Wei |last5=Wang |first5=Peiyu |title=Coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies |journal=Public Health Nutrition |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=346–57 |year=2013 |pmid=22694939 |doi=10.1017/S1368980012002601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and chlorogenic acid and its metabolites increase the protein expression levels of two DNA repair enzymes: Pms2 and PARP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Harris |last1=Bernstein |first2=Cheray |last2=Crowley-Skillicorn |first3=Carol |last3=Bernstein |first4=Katerina |last4=Dvorak |first5=Harinder |last5=Garewal |chapter=Dietary Compounds that Enhance DNA Repair and their Relevance to Cancer and Aging |pages=99–113 |chapterurl={{Google books|KxzvDlS90tUC|page=99|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Breehn R. |editor1-last=Landseer |year=2007 |title=New Research on DNA Repair |isbn=978-1-60021-385-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another compound that protects against the early stages of cancer is [[naringenin]], a citrus [[flavonoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonardi |first1=T. |last2=Vanamala |first2=J. |last3=Taddeo |first3=S.

A major project of the institute which fulfilled its mission to disseminate knowledge was publication of the book ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19598 How to Live, Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science]'', now in the [[public domain]].

The institute was a proponent of [[eugenics]] including sterilization of grossly "unfit" individuals:
{{cquote|&lt;em&gt;It depends largely upon the action of those now upon the earth, who are now making their choices of marriage, as to whether the races of the future shall be physical, mental or moral weaklings, or whether they shall be physically brave and hardy, mentally broad and profound, and morally sterling.

To summarize: There are three main lines along which eugenic improvement of the race may be attained:

(1) Education of all people on the inheritability of traits; (2) segregation of defectives so that they may not mingle their family traits with those on sound lines; (3) sterilization of certain gross and hopeless defectives, to preclude the propagation of their type.&lt;/em&gt;|40px|40px|Irving Fisher and Eugene Lyman Fisk|''How to Live, Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science''}}

The '''life sciences''' or '''biological sciences''' comprise the [[branches of science]] that involve the scientific study of [[life]] and [[organism]]s – such as [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s including [[human being]]s. 

Life science is one of the two major branches of [[natural science]], the other being [[physical Science|physical science]], which is concerned with non-living matter. 

By definition, [[biology]] is the [[natural science]] that studies life and living organisms, with the other life sciences being its sub-disciplines. 

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, [[zoology]] is the study of [[animals]], while [[botany]] is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as [[anatomy]] and [[genetics]]. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]]) other on larger scales (e.g. [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[ethology]], [[ecology]]). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the [[mind]]{{spaced ndash}}[[neuroscience]].

Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life, and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries.

==Basic life science branches==
{{Main|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}

[[Biology]] &amp;ndash; burst and eclectic field, composed of many branches and sub-disciplines. However, despite the complexity and the broad scope of the science, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into a single, coherent field. Here are some of biology's major branches:
* [[Anatomy]] – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms, or specifically in humans
* [[Astrobiology]] – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* [[Biochemistry]] – study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually a focus on the cellular level

*[[Bioinformatics]] &amp;ndash; developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge

* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of the biology and evolution of language
*[[Biological Anthropology|Biological anthropology]] – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids. Also known as physical anthropology
*[[Biomechanics]] – the study of the mechanics of living beings
*[[Biophysics]] – study of biological processes by applying the theories and methods that have been traditionally used in the physical sciences
*[[Botany]] – study of plants
*[[Cell biology]] – study of the cell as a complete unit, and the molecular and chemical interactions that occur within a living cell. Also known as cytology
*[[Developmental biology]] – study of the processes through which an organism forms, from zygote to full structure
*[[Ecology]] – study of the interactions of living organisms with one another and with the non-living elements of their environment
*[[Ethology]] – the study of behaviour
*[[Evolutionary biology]] – study of the origin and descent of species over time
*[[Evolutionary developmental biology]] – study of the evolution of development including its molecular control
*[[Genetics]] – study of genes and heredity
*[[Histology]] – the study of tissues
*[[Immunology]] – the study of the immune system
*[[Microbiology]] – study of microscopic organisms (microorganisms) and their interactions with other living organisms
*[[Molecular biology]] – study of biology and biological functions at the molecular level, some cross over with biochemistry, genetics and microbiology
*[[Neuroscience]] – study of the nervous system
* [[Pharmacology]] – the study of drug action
* [[Physiology]] – study of the functioning of living organisms and the organs and parts of living organisms
*[[Population biology]] – study of groups of conspecific organisms
* [[Quantum biology]] – the study of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] phenomena in organisms
*[[Structural biology]] – a branch of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[biophysics]] concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules
*[[Synthetic biology]] – the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits and cells, or the redesign of existing biological systems (LY)
*[[Systems biology]] – study of the integration and dependencies of various components within a biological system, with particular focus upon the role of [[metabolic pathways]] and [[Cell signaling|cell-signaling]] strategies in physiology
*[[Mathematical and theoretical biology|Theoretical biology]] – the use of abstractions and mathematical models to study biological phenomena
*[[Toxicology]] – study of the effects of chemicals on living organisms
*[[Zoology]] – study of animals, including classification, physiology, development, and behavior

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Researchers in [[positive psychology]] study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). "Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being." ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0060920432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making a fuller contribution by utilizing one's personal strengths,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195167015}}. {{cite web |title=See brief summary |url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2002). ''Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.'' New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyle PA, Buchman AS, Barnes LL, Bennett DA. Effect of a purpose in life on risk of incident Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older persons. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2010;67:304–310.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kim E, Sun J, Park N, Kubzansky L, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced risk of myocardial infarction among older US adults with coronary heart disease: A two-year follow-up. Journal of Behavioral Medicine.

Purpose in life and reduced incidence of stroke in older adults: The Health and Retirement Study.

Purpose in life is associated with mortality among community-dwelling older persons. Psychosomatic Medicine. 2009;71:574–579.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the British [[National Health Service]] began recommending a five step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:  (1) Connect with community and family; (2) Physical exercise; (3) Lifelong learning; (4) Giving to others; (5) [[Mindfulness]] of the world around you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/improve-mental-wellbeing.aspx|title=Five steps to mental wellbeing|work=www.nhs.uk|date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything. We're just the products of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The God Delusion|last = Dawkins|first = Richard|publisher = Houghton Mifflin|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0618680009|location = |pages = 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|The [[metric expansion of space]]. The [[inflationary epoch]] is the expansion of the [[metric tensor]] at left.]]

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M. Churchland |authorlink=Paul Churchland |title=A Neurocomputational Perspective: The Nature of Mind and the Structure of Science |publisher=MIT Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0262531061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daniel Clement Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Consciousness Explained |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |date=1991 |isbn=978-0316180665|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]]. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, [[parapsychologist]]s have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.&lt;ref name="Akers"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Akers, C. |title=Methodological Criticisms of Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 4 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1986 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104093732/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Child, I.L. |title=Criticism in Experimental Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 5 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1987 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223410/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiseman |first=Richard |author2=Smith, Matthew |display-authors=etal |title=Exploring possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld experiments – Psychophysical Research Laboratories |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |date=1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709230555/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lobach |first=E. |author2=Bierman, D. |title=The Invisible Gaze: Three Attempts to Replicate Sheldrake's Staring Effects |work=Proceedings of the 47th PA Convention |url=http://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |date=2004 |pages=77–90 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810173433/https://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}

Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

===19th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|19th-century philosophy}}

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life]. Webpages.uidaho.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism====
{{Main article|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====

[[File:HumanismSymbol.PNG|left|thumb|The "[[Happy Human]]" symbol representing [[Secular Humanism]].]]

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961).

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further information|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bahá'í Faith====

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the [[Manifestation of God|prophets]] were sent by God to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |date=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |pages=325–328 |isbn=978-1851681846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed Bahá'í perspective, see {{cite web |title={{-'}}The Purpose of Life' Bahá'í Topics An Information Resource of the Bahá'í International Community |url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829233333/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |archive-date=29 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism'', Menachem Kellner, Littman Library; particularly the parable of the King's Palace in divine worship, in the [[Guide for the Perplexed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |date=2003 |isbn=978-0415236614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0826408020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world to come,&lt;ref name="Shuchat"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |date=2006 |isbn=978-1932687316}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randolph L. Braham |title=Contemporary Views on the Holocaust |publisher=Springer |date=1983 |isbn=978-0898381412}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simeon the Just|Simeon the Righteous]] says, "the world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness." The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality].

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s ''All is Vanity,'' an example of ''[[vanitas]],'' depicts a young [[woman]] amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the [[mirror]] of her [[lowboy|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it. Six by nine… forty-two! I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living===
* To love more.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To love those who mean the most. Every life you touch will touch you back.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To treasure every enjoyable sensation one has.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To seek [[beauty]] in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To have fun or enjoy life.&lt;ref name="Cappannelli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan &amp; Pace" /&gt;
* To seek pleasure&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book |author=T.W. Mitchell |title=Problems in Psychopathology |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; company, inc. |date=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be compassionate.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;
* To be moved by the tears and pain of others, and try to help them out of love and compassion.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

* To eat, drink, and be merry.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastes8:15"&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ecclesiastes|8|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To have power, to be better===
* To [[will to power|strive for power]]&lt;ref name="Reginster" /&gt; and superiority.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;
* To rule the world.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book |author=John G. West |title=Celebrating Middle-Earth: The Lord of the Rings as a Defense of Western Civilization |publisher=Inkling Books |date=2002 |isbn=978-1587420122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* Life has no meaning, but as humans we try to associate a meaning or purpose so we can justify our existence.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Methuselah-like proteins''' are a family of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s found in insects that play a role in aging and reproduction. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonizing]] these receptors can extend the life span of the animal and make it more resistant to free radicals and starvation, but also reduce reproduction and increase cold sensitivity. The age dependent decline in olfaction and motor function is unaffected.&lt;ref name="pmid17764591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alic N, Partridge L | title = Antagonizing Methuselah to extend life span | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 222 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17764591 | pmc = 2374980 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-8-222 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homochirality==
Many of the essential molecules for life on Earth can exist in two mirror-image forms, referred to as "left-handed" and "right-handed", but living organisms do not use both. [[Protein]]s are exclusively composed of left-handed [[amino acids]]; [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] contain only right-handed [[sugar]]s. This phenomenon is known as [[homochirality]].&lt;ref name=Plaxco&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plaxco |first1= Kevin W. |last2=Michael |first2=Michael |title= Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn= 978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=140-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether homochirality emerged before or after life, whether the building blocks of life must have this particular chirality, or indeed whether life needs to be homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sedbrook |first1= Danielle |title=Must the Molecules of Life Always be Left-Handed or Right-Handed? |url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/space/must-all-molecules-life-be-left-handed-or-right-handed-180959956/ |accessdate=8 May 2018 |work= Smithsonian.com |date=28 July 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein chains built from amino acids of mixed chirality tend not to fold or function as catalysts, but mirror-image proteins have been constructed that work the same but on substrates of opposite handedness.&lt;ref name=Plaxco/&gt;

==The concept==
It is thought that such mirror organisms can be highly incompatible with existing microbes (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.). Hypothetically, it is possible to recreate an entire ecosystem from the bottom up, in chiral form. In this way, the creation of an Earth ecosystem without microbial diseases might be possible. In some distant future, mirror life could be employed to create robust, effective and disease-free ecosystems for use on other planets.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.wired.com/2010/11/ff_mirrorlife/ |last=Bohannon |first=John |title=Mirror-image cells could transform science - or kill us all |issue=12 |journal=Wired |volume=18 |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[synthetic biology]], like [[synthetic virology|synthesizing viruses]] since 2002, [[Mycoplasma laboratorium |partially synthetic bacteria]] in 2010, or [[synthetic ribosome]]s in 2013, may lead to the possibility of fully synthesizing a living cell from small molecules, where we could use mirror-image versions ([[enantiomer]]s) of life's building-block molecules, in place of the standard ones. Some proteins have been synthesized in mirror-image versions, including [[polymerase]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=nat1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1= Zimou |last2=Xu |first2=Weiliang |last3=Liu |first3=Lei |last4=Zhu |first4=Ting F. |title= A synthetic molecular system capable of mirror-image genetic replication and transcription |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume= 8 |issue=7 |year=2016 |pages=698–704 |issn=1755-4330 |doi= 10.1038/nchem.2517 |pmid= 27325097 |bibcode= 2016NatCh...8..698W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructing regular lifeforms in mirror-image form, using the mirror-image (chiral) reflection of their cellular components, could be achieved by substituting left-handed amino acids with right-handed ones, in order to create mirror reflections of all regular proteins. Analogously, we could get reflected sugars, DNA, etc., on which reflected enzymes would work perfectly. Finally we would get a normally functioning mirror reflection of a natural organism - a chiral counterpart organism - with which natural viruses and bacteria couldn't interact. Electromagnetic force (chemistry) is unchanged under such molecular reflection transformation ([[parity (physics)|P-symmetry]]). There is a small alteration of weak interactions under reflection, which can produce very small corrections, but these corrections are many orders of magnitude lower than thermal noise - almost certainly too tiny to alter any biochemistry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, there are also theories that weak interactions can have a greater effect on longer nucleic acids or protein chains, resulting in much less efficient conversion of mirror ribozymes or enzymes than normal ribozymes or enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pitkänen |first1=M. |title=Could the replication of mirror DNA teach something about chiral … |url=http://tgdtheory.fi/public_html/articles/mirrordna.pdf |website=Topological Geometrodynamics |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiral animals would need to feed on reflected food, produced by reflected plants. The great advantage, though, is that such chiral organisms should enjoy a disease-free life, completely immune to all viruses and microbes (which virologists are now beginning to understand underlie a huge number of diseases).

Viruses would be completely incompatible with the reflected cellular structures; and bacteria, protozoa, and fungi could not function because they would not be able to find normal sugars inside reflected organisms. The reverse sugars circulating in the chiral organism's body would be indigestible as far as normal bacteria are concerned, so any bacterium entering a chiral organism would simply starve to death. The chiral environment is hostile for normal viruses, protozoa, bacteria, etc.

Mirror life presents potential dangers. For example, a chiral-mirror version of [[cyanobacteria]], which only needs achiral nutrients and light for [[photosynthesis]], could take over Earth's ecosystem due to lack of natural enemies, disturbing the bottom of the food chain by producing mirror versions of the required sugars. Some bacteria can digest [[L-Glucose|L-glucose]]; exceptions like this would give some rare lifeforms an unanticipated advantage.

==Direct applications==
Direct application of mirror-chiral organisms can be mass production of [[enantiomer]]s (mirror-image) of molecules produced by normal life.

*[[Enantiopure drug]]s - some pharmaceuticals have known different activity depending on enantiomeric form,
*[[Aptamer]]s ([[L-Ribonucleic acid aptamer|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleic acid aptamers]]): "That makes mirror-image biochemistry a potentially lucrative business. One company that hopes so is [[Noxxon Pharma]] in Berlin. It uses laborious chemical synthesis to make mirror-image forms of short strands of DNA or RNA called aptamers, which bind to therapeutic targets such as proteins in the body to block their activity. The firm has several mirror-aptamer candidates in human trials for diseases including cancer; the idea is that their efficacy might be improved because they aren't degraded by the body's enzymes. A process to replicate mirror-image DNA could offer a much easier route to making the aptamers, says Sven Klussmann, Noxxon Pharma's chief scientific officer."&lt;ref name=polym&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Peplow |first1=Mark |title=Mirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA |journal=Nature |date=16 May 2016 |volume=533 |issue=7603 |pages=303–304 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2016.19918 |pmid=27193657 |bibcode= 2016Natur.533..303P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The creation of one chiral human is the basis of 1950 Arthur C. Clarke's story "[[Technical Error]]", from The Collected Stories. In this story, a physical accident transforms a person into his mirror image, speculatively explained by travel through a fourth physical dimension.

An alien machine that reverses chirality, and a blood-symbiote that functions properly only when in one chirality, were central to Roger Zelazny's 1976 novel [[Doorways in the Sand]].

In the 2017 [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]] novel "Change Agent", an antagonist, Otto, nicknamed the "Mirror Man", is revealed to be a genetically-engineered enantiomeric human. He views other humans with disdain and causes them to feel an inexplicable repulsion by his very presence.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding what (if anything) counts as "morally obligatory" is a principal concern of [[ethics]].

Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as [[moral agents]]. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form [[intention]]s about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of [[free will]] has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. [[Incompatibilist]]s regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas [[compatibilist]]s think the two can coexist.
 
Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to [[legal liability |legal responsibility]]. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Philosophical stance==
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|220px|Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over [[determinism]] and free will]]
Depending on how a philosopher conceives of [[free will]], they will have different views on moral responsibility.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite book |title=Responsibility in Law and Morality |author=Peter Cave |page =4 |quote=A common argument in the philosophical literature is that the essence of responsibility is to be found in what it means to be a human agent and to have free will...There is disagreement amongst philosophers about what freedom means, about whether human beings are free in the relevant sense, and about the relevance of freedom to responsibility... Nevertheless,...our responsibility practices have developed, and thrive, independently of ‘the truth’ about human freedom.|isbn=1841133213 |year=2002 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibilism===
{{main article|Incompatibilism}}

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{main article|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[Metaphysical libertarian]]s think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; they think that if causal determinism were true of human action; people would not have free will. Accordingly, libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfolk, Robert L.|first=Doris, John M., and Brianna, John M.|contribution=Identification, Situational Constraint, and Social Cognition: Studies in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahmias, Eddy, |first=Morris, Stephen G., Nadelhoffer, Thomas N., and Turner, Jason|contribution=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: "...we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse".&lt;ref name="Sartre2"&gt;Sartre, J.P. (1943)''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has it that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions "reflect on their character". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vuoso, G. (1987) "Background Responsibility and Excuse," ''Yale Law Journal'', 96, pp. 1680–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, R. "Culpability" and Mental Disorder", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The [[insanity defense]]—or its corollary, [[diminished responsibility]] (a sort of appeal to the [[fallacy of the single cause]])—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. &amp; Shapiro, D. L. 2003 "Evaluation of criminal responsibility". In ''Forensic psychology.'' vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).

=====The argument from luck=====

The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside that person's control. It may not be reasonable, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/|title=Moral Luck|date=January 26, 2004|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Nagel]] suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of ''drunk driving'' might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1976, "Moral Luck", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument can be traced back to [[David Hume]]. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main article|Hard determinism}}
[[Hard determinist]]s (not to be confused with [[Fatalist]]s) often use [[liberty]] in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say "So much the worse for free will!".&lt;ref name="Ben1"&gt;Benditt, Theodore (1998) ''Philosophy Then and Now'' with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55786-742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, [[Leopold and Loeb]], by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence, 1924, "The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During his summation, he declared:

{{quote|What has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay.&lt;ref name="Darrow"/&gt;}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul, "Epistle to the Romans", 9:21, ''King James Bible'' Tennessee:The Gideons International&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God.

Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuroethics]], argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]) intuitions.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). "For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'', 359, 1775–1785.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research (e.g. [[neuroscience of free will]]) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid [[psychosis]], but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the [[frontal lobe]] reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.&lt;ref name = "Brower"&gt;Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). "Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', 71: 720–726.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,&lt;ref name = "SteinScott"&gt;Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). "Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty".''American Psychologist'' 58, 1009–1018.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.&lt;ref name = "TAPANK"&gt;Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). "The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment". ''Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews'', 27: 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them.

[[File:Prision del Condado de Mantras.JPG|thumb|right|180px|David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.html David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of [[justice]], in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of [[Ethical realism|ethically realistic]] and [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will.

Neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the "sentencing phase" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman/&gt;

====Hard incompatibilism====
[[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] defends a skeptical position about free will he calls [[hard incompatibilism]]. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing.&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title="Defending Hard Incompatibilism". In "Free Will and Moral Responsibility." |year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-3810-6|pages=228–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2001), ''Living without Free Will'', Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), ''Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{main article|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Handcuffs-20060604.jpg|thumb|right|Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term ''free will'' should only be used to mean something more like liberty.]]

Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad Gita]]'' offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: "... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave..." When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself.&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhagavad Gita|year=1962|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda also said, "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inspirational Thought for Each Day|year=1977|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the ''Bhagavad Gita{{'}}''s point about agents and natural forces, writing "men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes]."&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"/&gt; Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: "Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?"&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"/&gt; Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baruch Spinoza|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
[[Daniel Dennett]] asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be "a purely metaphysical hankering".&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;Dennett, D., (1984) ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, research in [[experimental philosophy]] has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eddy |last=Nahmias|author2=Stephen Morris |author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer |author4=Jason Turner  |title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive? |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=28–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaun|last=Nichols |authorlink=Shaun Nichols |author2=[[Joshua Knobe]]  |title=Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions |journal=[[Noûs]] |volume=41 |issue=4|pages=663–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00666.x |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neuroscience of free will investigates various experiments that might shed light on free will.

==Collective==
{{Main article|Collective responsibility}}
When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/collecti.htm ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''] (Accessed 8 Sept 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[South Africa]] had an [[apartheid]] regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non-European South Africans.

==Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths==
One of the attributes defined for [[psychopathy]] is "failure to accept responsibility for own actions".&lt;ref name=factorstructure&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R. D., &amp; Hakstian, A. R.|title=Two-factor conceptualization of psychopathy: Construct validity and assessment implications.|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–17|year=1989|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.1.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial systems ==

The emergence of [[Outline of automation|automation, robotics and related technologies]] prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?'&lt;ref name="Allen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Varner|first2=Gary|last3=Zinser|first3=Jason|title=Prolegomena to any future artificial moral agent|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=2000|volume=12|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1080/09528130050111428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Smit|first2=Iva|last3=Wallach|first3=Wendell|title=Artificial Morality: Top-down, Bottom-up and Hybrid Approaches|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparrow|first1=Robert|title=Killer Robots|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grodzinsky|first1=Frances S.|last2=Miller|first2=Keith W.|last3=Wolf|first3=Marty J.|title=The ethics of designing artificial agents|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=21 Jun 2008|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=115–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuflik|first1=Arthur|title=Computers in control: Rational transfer of authority or irresponsible abdication of autonomy?|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1023/A:1010087500508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions ''arguably'' adjoin with but are distinct from [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems.  Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate.

=== Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible ===

Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr posited that [[intentionality]] is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Kahn, Jr.|first2=Peter H.|title=Human Agency and Responsible Computing: Implications for Computer System Design|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=January 1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(92)90075-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers.&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999" /&gt;

Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as [[finite state machines]].  They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008" /&gt;

Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans.  He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014.  An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour.  Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Artificial moral agents are infeasible with foreseeable technologies|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=13 May 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1007/s10676-014-9345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"/&gt;)

=== Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible ===

Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'.&lt;ref name="Allen2000"/&gt; They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the [[Turing Test]].&lt;ref name="Allen2005" /&gt;

Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription.  He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators.  First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means.  Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means.  Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthias|first1=Andreas|title=The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=175–183|doi=10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C. K.|date=August 2013|title=Antimüllerian hormone inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone-induced adenylyl cyclase activation, aromatase expression, and estradiol production in human granulosa-lutein cells|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=2|pages=585–592.e1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.04.019|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23663993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Personal experience''' of a [[human being]] is the moment-to-moment [[experience]] and [[sensory awareness]] of internal and external [[event (philosophy)|events]] or a sum of experiences forming an empirical unity such as a period of life.

==History==
An early belief of some philosophers of [[Ancient Greece]] was that the [[mind]] was like a [[Analog recording|recording]] device and simply kept somehow-objective records of what the [[senses]] experienced. This was believed in the Western world into the 20th century until [[cognitive psychology]] experiments decisively proved that it was not true, and that many events were simply filled in by the mind, based on what "should be". This, among other things, explained why [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of events often were so widely varied.

In [[Ancient Rome]] it was believed that personal experience was part of some divine or species-wide [[collective experience]]. This gave rise to notions of [[racial memory]], [[national mission]], and such notions as [[racism]] and [[patriotism]]. It was likely easier to create [[political movement]]s and military morale with such notions, than a strictly personal idea of experience. [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] were notable investigators of these ideas of collective experience in the 20th century.

During [[the Enlightenment]], there was rigorous investigation of these ideas. [[Immanuel Kant]] noted that it was only possible to explain "experience and its objects" as a consequence of each other: either experience makes those objects possible, or those objects make experience possible. This is seen today as [[Epistemological dualism|dualism]], and denying the possibility of a third thing making both experience and whatever reality its objects have, both possible. That thing could be a more universal [[cognition]], as proposed in some versions of [[Christianity]] or [[Gaia philosophy]].

The '''philosophy of happiness''' is the [[philosophical]] concern with the [[existence]], [[nature]], and attainment of [[happiness]]. Philosophers believe, happiness can be understood as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance; indeed, in most European languages the term happiness is synonymous with luck.&lt;ref&gt;Cassin et al. ''Dictionary of Untranslatables''. Princeton University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#MeaHap|title=Happiness|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==

===Plato===
{{rquote|right|''We have proved that justice in itself is the best thing for the soul itself, and that the soul ought to do justice...''|[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'' 10.612b&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Plato]] (c. 428{{snd}} c. 347 BCE), using [[Socrates]] (c. 470{{snd}} 399 BCE) as the main character in his [[Plato#The dialogues|philosophical dialogues]], outlined the requirements for happiness in ''The Republic''.

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the [[cardinal virtues]], particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the [[Ring of Gyges]], Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12487162/Plato_Happiness_and_Justice Joshua Olsen, ''Plato, Happiness and Justice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sees a type of happiness stemming from [[social justice]] through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness{{snd}} such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure{{snd}} are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27743804 Richard D. Mohr, "A Platonic Happiness". ''History of Philosophy Quarterly,'' Vol. 4, No. 2 (Apr., 1987), pp. 131-145.University of Illinois.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] (384 – 322 BCE) held that ''[[eudaimonia]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]]) is the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is usually translated as [[happiness]], but "human flourishing" may be a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]) in accordance with [[virtue]].

Within the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible.&lt;ref&gt;Book I Chapter 1 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1094a 1094a].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation.

Aristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this moral skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut, Richard, "Aristotle's Ethics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-ethics/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cynicism===
{{Main|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[File:Greek philosopher busts.jpg|thumb|The carved busts of [[Socrates]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Epicurus]].]]

[[Antisthenes]] (c. 445 – c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], advocated an ascetic life lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. Xenophon testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang "from out of one's soul,"&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Symposium, iv. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: "I would rather go mad than feel pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', vi. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a [[Socrates]].

He, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], and [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].&lt;ref name="cynic1"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] – ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, happiness can be gained through [[asceticism|rigorous training]] (askesis, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἄσκησις|ἄσκησις]]) and by living in a way which was natural for [[humans]], rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions.

[[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 – c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The [[stoicism|Stoics]] themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of [[sophos (philosophy)|sage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/497576|title=The Stoic Sage|work=ancientworlds.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoicism===
{{Main|Stoicism}}
{{rquote|right|''If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happy. And there is no man able to prevent this.''|[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''. iii.12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Stoicism]] was a school of philosophy established by [[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was [[syncretism|syncretic]] in thought, his primary influence were the Cynics, with [[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365 – c. 285 BCE) as his mentor.

Stoics believe that "virtue is sufficient for [[happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. In the words of Epictetus, this sage would be "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying [[Stoic logic]], [[Stoic physics]], and [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|Stoic ethics]].

===Cyrenaics===
{{Main|Cyrenaics}}
{{rquote|right|''As a consequence the [[sage (philosophy)|sage]], even if he has his troubles, will nonetheless be happy, even if few pleasures accrue to him.''|[[Diogenes Laertius]] on [[Anniceris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ii. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans. Robin Hard. Oxford University Press, 2012. Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Cyrenaics]] were a school of philosophy established by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]] (c. 435 – c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus]], in his ''Historical Miscellany'',&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, Historical Miscellany 14.6&lt;/ref&gt; writes about Aristippus:

{{quote|"He recommended that one should concrete on the present day, and indeed on the very part of it in which one is acting and thinking. For only the present, he said, truly belongs to us, and not what has passed by or what we are anticipating: for the one is gone and done with, and it is uncertain whether the other will come to be"&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans. Robin Hard. Oxford University Press, 2012. Page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="copleston122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epicureanism===
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
{{rquote|right|''Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship.''|Epicurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus - Principal Doctrines|author=Vincent Cook|work=epicurus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Epicureanism]] was founded by [[Epicurus]] (c. 341 – c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of [[ataraxia|tranquility]] (''ataraxia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἀταραξία|ἀταραξία]]) and freedom from fear, as well as [[aponia|absence of bodily pain]] (''aponia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary: ἀπονία|ἀπονία]]). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an [[asceticism|ascetic lifestyle]], noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics.

One aid to achieving happiness is the ''[[tetrapharmakos]]'' or the four-fold cure:

[[File:Tetrapharmakos PHerc 1005 col 5.png|250px|thumb|A [[papyrus]] copy depicting the Epicurean [[tetrapharmakos]] in [[Philodemus of Gadara]]'s ''Adversus Sophistas'' - [[Herculaneum papyri|(P.Herc.1005), col. 5]]]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Do not fear [[god]],&lt;br&gt;
Do not worry about [[death]];&lt;br&gt;
What is [[good and evil|good]] is easy to get, and&lt;br&gt;
What is terrible is easy to [[endurance|endure]]."&lt;br&gt;
(''[[Philodemus]], [[Herculaneum Papyrus]], 1005, 4.9–14'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Hutchinson|first =D. S. (Introduction)|title =The Epicurus Reader: Selected Writings and Testimonia|publisher =Cambridge: Hackett|year =1994|page =vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===School of the Sextii===
{{Main|School of the Sextii}}

The School of the Sextii was founded by [[Quintus Sextius the Elder]] ([[fl.]] 50 BCE).

[[St. Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD)  was an early [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] and [[philosopher]]&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Mendelson|first=Michael|title=Saint Augustine|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose writings influenced the development of [[Western Christianity]] and [[Western philosophy]].

For St. Augustine, all human actions revolve around [[love]], and the primary problem humans face is the misplacing of love.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/achieving-hapGenesis creation narrativepiness-advice-augustine&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[God]] can one find happiness, as He is source of happiness. Since [[Genesis creation narrative|humanity was brought forth from God]], but has [[Fall of man|since fallen]], one's [[soul]] dimly remembers the happiness from when one was with God.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1582804 R. J. O'Connell, "The Enneads and St. Augustine's Image of Happiness." ''Vigiliae Christianae'' Vol. 17, No. 3 (Sep., 1963)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if one orients themselves toward the love of God, all other loves will become properly ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/achieving-happiness-advice-augustine|title=Achieving Happiness: Advice from Augustine|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, St. Augustine follows the [[Neoplatonic]] tradition in asserting that happiness lays in the contemplation of the purely intelligible realm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

St. Augustine deals with the concept of happiness directly in his treatises ''De beata vita'' and ''Contra Academicos''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Boethius===
{{rquote|right|''Mortal creatures have one overall concern. This they work at by toiling over a whole range of pursuits, advancing on different paths, but striving to attain the one goal of happiness.''|[[Boethius]], ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]].&lt;ref name="catholic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/true-happiness-and-the-consolation-of-philosophy|title=True Happiness and The Consolation of Philosophy|work=catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Boethius]] (c. 480–524 AD) was a [[philosopher]], most famous for writing ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''. The work has been described as having had the single most important influence on the [[Christianity]] [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|of the Middle Ages and]] early [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and as the last great work of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Consolation of Philosophy'', Oxford World's Classics, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante Divine"&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] identified Boethius as the "last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics" among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and also below).&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes many themes, but among them he discusses how happiness can be attainable despite changing [[Luck|fortune]], while considering the nature of happiness and God.

He posits that happiness is acquired by attaining the perfect good, and that perfect good is God.&lt;ref name="catholic.com"/&gt; He then concludes that as God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[File:Avicenna Drawing.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A drawing of Avicenna, 1960.]]

According to Al-Ghazali, there are four main constituents of happiness: self-knowledge, knowledge of God, knowledge of this world as it really is, and the knowledge of the next world as it really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnah.org/tasawwuf/alchemy.htm|title=The Alchemy of Happiness|author=Imam Muhammad Al-Ghazali|year=1910|accessdate=8 January 2016}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern==

=== Michel de Montaigne ===
[[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533-1592) was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]]. Influenced by [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Christianity]], alongside the conviction of the separation of public and private spheres of life, Montaigne writes that happiness is a subjective state of mind and that satisfaction differs from person to person.&lt;ref name="utm.edu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/montaign/|title=Montaigne, Michel de - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues by acknowledging that one must be allowed a private sphere of life to realize those particular attempts of happiness without the interference of society.&lt;ref name="utm.edu1"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748-1832) was a British [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], and [[social reformer]]. He is regarded as the founder of modern [[utilitarianism]].

His particular brand of utilitarianism indicated that the most moral action is that which causes the highest amount of utility, where defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/|title=Bentham, Jeremy - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong - such as ascetic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"/&gt; This manner of thinking permits the possibility of [[Felicific calculus|a calculator to measure happiness and moral value]].

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788-1860) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]]. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, whereas only [[compassion]] can be a moral act.

Schopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when time moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea. Cologne 1997, Volume One, §52th.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary==

===Władysław Tatarkiewicz===
[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886-1980) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], historian of [[philosophy]], historian of [[art]], [[estethician|esthetician]], and [[ethics|ethicist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;686.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tatarkiewicz, happiness is a fundamental ethical category.

===Herbert Marcuse===
[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]].

In his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/|title=Herbert Marcuse|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be [[democracy|democratic]], but is [[authoritarian]] in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marcuse | first1 = Herbert | title = One-dimensional Man: studies in ideology of advanced industrial society | chapter = Introduction to the Second Edition | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | location = London | pages = 3 | isbn = 978-0-415-07429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging.

===Viktor Frankl===

{{rquote|right|''It is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to 'be happy.' But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.

===Robert Nozick===
{{Main|Experience machine}}
[[Robert Nozick]] (1938-2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ |title=Nozick, Robert |work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |first=Edward |last=Feser |date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a thought experiment where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life.

===Scientism===
[[File:World happiness 2006.png|thumb|300px|The [[Satisfaction with Life Index]]]]

[[Scientism]] is the approach that the [[empirical sciences]] are the most valuable branches of learning and culture.

===Happiness economics===
[[Happiness economics]] is the quantitative and  theoretical study of [[happiness]], positive and negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[life satisfaction]] and related concepts, typically combining [[economics]] with other fields such as [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The tracking of [[Gross National Happiness]] or the [[Satisfaction with Life Index|satisfaction of life]] grow increasingly popular as the economics of happiness challenges traditional economic aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Layard]], 2006. "Happiness and Public Policy: A Challenge to the Profession," ''Economic Journal'', 116(510), Conference Papers, pp. [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/david.harvey/MKT3008/Poverty/Layard2006.pdf C24-C33.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Layard]] has been very influential in this area. He has shown that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Happiness-Lessons-New-Science-Second-ebook/dp/B004TRQAS6/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521575888&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=richard+layard&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonja Lyubomirsky===
[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] asserted in her 2007 book, ''The How of Happiness'', that happiness is 50 percent genetically determined (based on twin studies),&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Lyubomirsky, David Schkade and Kennon M. Sheldon, [http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall06/macdonalda/psy4960/Readings/LyubomirskySustain_RGP05.pdf "Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change,"] Review of General Psychology, Vol. 9, No. 2, 111–131, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 10 percent circumstancial, and 40 percent subject to [[self-control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21197|title=Are You Happy? by Sue Halpern|work=nybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201486,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_D_happy19.3d48c86.html|title=News : Press Enterprise|work=pe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyubomirsky suggests a twelve-point program to maximize the final 40 percent.

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

The idea of '''self-replicating spacecraft''' has been applied – in theory – to several distinct "tasks". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of [[space exploration]] is known as a '''von Neumann [[Space probe|probe]]'''. Other variants include the [[#Berserkers|Berserker]] and an automated [[terraforming]] seeder ship.

== Theory ==
In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[gas giant]]s, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, "Lungfish" (see [[Self-replicating machines in fiction]]), [[David Brin]] touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a [[Darwinism|Darwinistic]] fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of "species" they might even form a type of [[ecology]], or – should they also have a form of [[artificial intelligence]] – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of "generations".

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm| bibcode=1980JBIS...33..251F}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting [[automatic factory|automated industrial complex]] to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm Comparison of Reproducing and Nonreproducing Starprobe Strategies for Galactic Exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic [[faster-than-light]] propulsion, and speeds limited to an "average cruising speed" of 0.1'''[[Speed of light|c]]'''.) could spread throughout a [[galaxy]] the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as half a million years.

==Implications for Fermi's paradox==
In 1981, [[Frank Tipler]]&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;"Extraterrestrial Beings Do Not Exist", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 21, number 267 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an argument that [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the [[Fermi paradox]] – that is, the question of why we have not ''already'' encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response&lt;ref name="Sagan and Newman"&gt;Sagan, Carl and Newman, William: "The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 24, number 113 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Carl Sagan]] and William Newman. Now known as ''Sagan's Response'', it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=Extraterrestrial Intelligence in the Solar System: Resolving the Fermi Paradox| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=36|date=November 1983| pages=496–500| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ResolvingFermi1983.htm| bibcode=1983JBIS...36..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[nuclear warfare]], [[grey goo|nanoterrorism]], [[resource depletion|resource exhaustion]], [[environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]], or [[pandemic]]s.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. [[Radio]] transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic [[parsec]]) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the [[Hayflick limit]] in cell reproduction.  One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation).  Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel.  The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate.  The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials.  Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is named after [[Hungarian American]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[John von Neumann]], who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called "Universal Assemblers" and which are often referred to as "[[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]]".  While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a [[Bracewell probe]]), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist [[Paul Davies]] of [[Arizona State University]] has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own [[Moon]], having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']].

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the "[[Astrochicken]]", proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]]. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its "home base", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own [[planetary system]], and not explore interstellar space.

Oxford-based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea that future powerful [[superintelligence]]s will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson Swarm]] around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox]. Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berserkers ===
{{noref|section|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- [[Berserker probe]] section-redirects here --&gt;

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the ''Berserker''. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing [[exoplanets]] whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' series of novels by [[Fred Saberhagen]] which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – ''do'' constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] civilization (see ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', by [[Greg Bear]], in the section [[#In fiction|In fiction]] below) or could theoretically "mutate" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for [[terraforming]] processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable [[exoplanet]], or even one that might be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from [[embryo space colonization|stored embryos]] or from stored information using [[molecular nanotechnology]] to build [[zygotes]] with varying genetic information from local raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist."  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 21 (1980): page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to [[Generation ship]]s as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
	 
* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': The [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]s in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[book]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", Clarke's original short story upon which 2001 was based, were not.  The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke's novel.
	 
* ''[[Cold as Ice (novel)|Cold As Ice]]'': In the novel by [[Charles Sheffield]], there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[helium-4]], and various metals from the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]].
	 
* ''[[Destiny's Road]]'': [[Larry Niven]] frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book ''Destiny's Road'', Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans' technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] which serves as the humans' primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.

* ''[[No Man's Sky]]'': In the video game ''No Man's Sky'' mysterious probes called Sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy, analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction. It is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxy.
	 
* ''[[The Devil's Blind Spot]]'': See also [[Alexander Kluge]], ''The Devil's Blind Spot'' (New Directions; 2004.)
	 
* ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]'': In the novel by [[Robert Charles Wilson]], Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth's and the aliens' probes.
	 
* ''[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]'': In the book by [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] (published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity's existence to whoever might encounter them.
	 
* ''[[Von Neumann's War]]'': In ''Von Neumann's War'' by [[John Ringo]] and [[Travis S. Taylor]] (published by [[Baen Books]] in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineers]] some of the probes.
	 
* ''[[Grey Goo (video game)|Grey Goo]]'': In the video game ''Grey Goo'', the "Goo" faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction's units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the [[Grey Goo]] doomsday scenario.

* ''We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'' by [[Dennis E. Taylor]]: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America's religious replacement, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.

=== Berserkers ===
	 
* In the science fiction short story collection ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]], a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same [[fictional universe]] are the origin of the term "Berserker probe".
	 
* In the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (and the subsequent [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 series]]) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
	 
* The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker's massive mechanical Spheres).
	 
* Science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] later borrowed this notion in his short story "[[Limits (novel)|A Teardrop Falls]]".
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Star Control II]]'', the [[Slylandro]] Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks [[starship]]s of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to "resource extraction" mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce "at a geometric rate", the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player's ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
	 
* In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Excession]]'', hegemonising swarms are described as a form of [[Outside Context Problem]]. An example of an "Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object" is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself.  After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the [[Zetetic Elench]] and become "Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects". Such swarms (referred to as "smatter") reappear in the later novels ''[[Surface Detail]]'' (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
	 
* The [[Inhibitors (Revelation Space)|Inhibitors]] from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures.  They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets.  They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to 'remember' the necessary counter-measures.
	 
* Also from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' books, the "Greenfly" terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
	 
* The [[Reapers (Mass Effect)|Reapers]] in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' that they assimilate any advanced species.
	 
* [[Mantrid]] Drones from the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Lexx]]'' were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Infection (Babylon 5)|Infection]]" showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a 'Pure Icaran' based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]" features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization's level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
	 
* [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' deals directly with the concept of "Berserker" von Neumann probes and their consequences.  The idea is further explored in the novel's sequel, ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
	 
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'' series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'', and then in an attack in ''[[Across the Sea of Suns]]''.  The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in ''Across the Sea of Suns''.  The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
	 
* On ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced "races" known. 
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
	 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including [[List of starships in Stargate#Destiny|Destiny]]) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don't bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
	 
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[List of Justice League episodes#ep10|Dark Heart]]", an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
	 
* In the ''[[Homeworld: Cataclysm]]'' video game, a bio-mechanical virus called ''Beast'' has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
	 
* In the SF [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[EVE Online]]'', experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player's ships accidentally created 'rogue drones' which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'', the player may randomly encounter "Von Neumann". A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player's ships.  The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material.  If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones.  If all the player's ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving.  The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points.  The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion ''A Murder of Crows'', Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
	 
* In the ''[[X (computer game series)|X Computer Game Series]]'', the [[X (game series)#Featured races|Xenon]] are a malevolent race of [[AI|artificially intelligent]] machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update.  They are continual antagonists in the [[X (computer game series)#The X Universe|X-Universe]].
	 
* In the comic ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' a character mentions "Von Neumann rectal infestations" which are apparently caused by "Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks".
	 
* In the anime ''[[Vandread]]'', harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
	 
* In ''[[Earth 2160]]'', the Morphidian Aliens rely on {{Not a typo|Mantain}} strain aliens for colonization. Most {{Not a typo|Mantain}}-derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one {{Not a typo|Mantain}} Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they "choose an evolutionary path" and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
	 
* In the European comic series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' No 20 &amp; 21 goes over this subject. A kind of bezerk von Neumann is set to collision course with the pandarve system.
	 
* In PC role-playing game ''[[Space Rangers (video game)|Space Rangers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Space Rangers 2: Dominators]]'', a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
	 
* In the ''[[Star Wolves]]'' video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
	 
* The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
	 
* The Tet in the 2013 film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet's water in order to extract hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]].
	 
* In ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'', an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
	 
* In ''[[Herr aller Dinge]]'' by [[Andreas Eschbach]], an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is purposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.
	 
=== Replicating Seeder Ships ===
	 
* ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn's moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
	 
* ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
	 
* In the ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy|Metroid Prime]]'' subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
	 
* In [[David Brin]]'s short story collection, ''[[The River of Time]]'' (1986), the short story "Lungfish" prominently features von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;The complete text of the story has been placed on the author's website at [http://www.davidbrin.com/lungfish1.html davidbrin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
	 
* In ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as [[fire and forget]] lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their "children".
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep95|Remnants]]", the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)#ep75|Scorched Earth]]", a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the human adventurers live on a ship called ''Destiny''. Its mission was to connect a network of [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]], placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
	 
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' by [[Don Lawrence]] (starting with ''Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine'') is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shangri-La''' is a fictional place described in the 1933 [[novel]] ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] – a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of [[the Orient]].

In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.&lt;ref name="National Park brochure"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra
|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park &amp; Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).

==Etymology==
The phrase "Shangri-La" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|ཞང་}}'',"Shang" – a district of [[Ü-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Das – Tibetan English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;" + ''{{lang|bo|རི}}'', pronounced "ri", "Mountain" = "Shang Mountain" + ''{{lang|bo|ལ}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, "Shang Mountain Pass".

While the name Shangri-La is of relatively recent origin, the concept previously existed.
* Some scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jewish sources describe a city named [[Luz]], "in which the angel of death has no permission to enter for a thousand years: its citizens have the ability to live forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/between-luz-and-beit-el-power-transformational-moments
|title=Between Luz And Beit El: The Power of Transformational Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same description is given for a location named ''Kushta'' - based on the [[Aramaic]] word for truth. In this city, the only reason for death was if a person told an untruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Academic scholars have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Peter (1989).

In China, the poet [[Tao Yuanming]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420&amp;nbsp;CE) described a kind of Shangri-La in his work ''[[The Peach Blossom Spring|The Tale of the Peach Blossom Spring]]'' ({{zh|t=桃花源記|p=Táohuā Yuán Jì}}). The story goes that there was a fisherman from [[Wuling]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}}, who came across a beautiful peach grove, and he discovered happy and content people who lived completely cut off from the troubles in the outside world since the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–207&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="Peach Colony"&gt;{{cite web

[[Shambhala]] is a core concept in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that describes a realm of harmony between man and nature that is also connected with the Kalachakra or "wheel of time". The Shambhala ideal is described in detail in the [[Shambhala Sutra]], a historical text written by the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth Panchen Lama (1737–1780)]] which describes some of the Shambhala locations as being in [[Ngari]], the western prefecture of [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition&gt;[[Laurence Brahm|Brahm, Laurence]]. (2004). ''Shambhala Sutrah'' (film expedition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore from the [[Altai Mountains]] describe [[Gora Belukha|Mount Belukha]] as a gateway to [[Shambhala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/mysteries-kingdom-shambhala-001529|title=Mysteries of the Kingdom of Shambhala|first=|last=aprilholloway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kun Lun Mountains]] (崑崙山) offer another possible place for valleys like the Shangri-La, since Hilton specifically described the “Kuen-Lun” mountains as its likely location in the book, however, Hilton is not known to have visited or studied the area.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Parts of the [[Kun Lun Mountains|Kun Lun]] lie within [[Ngari]], mentioned in the [[Shambhala]] Sutra.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"/&gt;

===Possible sources for Hilton===
In a ''New York Times'' interview in 1936, Hilton states that he used "Tibetan material" from the [[British Museum]], particularly the travelogue of two French priests, [[Evariste Regis Huc]] and [[Joseph Gabet]], to provide the Tibetan cultural and Buddhist spiritual inspiration for Shangri-La.&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;Michael McRae. (2002). ''The Siege of Shangri-La: The Quest for Tibet's Sacred Hidden Paradise''. New York: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;B.R. Crisler. (1936). Film gossip of the week. ''The New York Times'', 26&amp;nbsp;July 1936, section&amp;nbsp;9, page&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Huc and Gabet travelled a roundtrip between Beijing and Lhasa in 1844–1846 on a route more than {{convert|250|km}} north of Yunnan. Their famous travelogue, first published in French in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc. (1850). ''Souvenirs d'un&amp;nbsp;voyage dans la&amp;nbsp;Tartarie, le&amp;nbsp;Thibet et la&amp;nbsp;Chine pendant les&amp;nbsp;annees 1844, 1845, et 1846''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; went through many editions in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Mille. (1953). A selective survey of literature on Tibet. ''American Political Science Review'', 47&amp;nbsp;(4): 1135–1151.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular "condensed translation" was published in England in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc &amp; Joseph Gabet. (1928). ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China, 1844–1846''. Edited and translated by William Hazlitt. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time that Hilton would have been gathering inspiration for – or perhaps writing – ''Lost Horizon''.

===Current claimants===
Today various places, such as parts of southern [[Kham]] in northwestern [[Yunnan]] province, including the tourist destinations of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and Zhongdian, claim the title. In modern China, [[Zhongdian]] county was renamed Xiānggélǐlā (香格里拉, Shangri-La in Chinese) in 2001, to attract tourists.

Hilton visited the [[Hunza Valley]] in northern [[Pakistan]], close to the Chinese border, a few years before ''Lost Horizon'' was published; hence it is a popularly believed inspiration for Hilton's physical description of Shangri-La.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shangri-la Valley |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-29 |publisher=Adventure Tours Pakistan |url=http://www.atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083212/http://atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel; also, in an ironic reversal on the story, due to increased exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation, inhabitants of the high-altitude parts of the valley appear to age quickly.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, because the Hunza Valley does not have [[Tibetan culture]] and lacks Buddhist religion, it could not have been the inspiration for the cultural context for Hilton's [[Lost Horizon|story]].

Places like [[Sichuan]] and [[Tibet]] also claim the real Shangri-La was in its{{where|date=January 2014}} territory. In 2001, [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] put forward a proposal that the three regions optimise all Shangri-La tourism resources and promote them as one. After failed attempts to establish a China Shangri-la Ecological Tourism Zone in 2002 and 2003, government representatives of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region signed a declaration of co-operation in 2004. Also in 2001, [[Zhongdian]] County in northwestern [[Yunnan]] officially renamed itself [[Shangri-La County]].

===Recent searches and documentaries===
American explorers [[Ted Vaill]] and [[Peter Klika]] visited the [[Muli Tibetan Autonomous County|Muli]] area of southern [[Sichuan Province]] in 1999, and claimed that the Muli [[monastery]] in this remote region was the model for James Hilton's Shangri-La, which they thought Hilton learned about from articles on this area in several ''National Geographic'' magazine articles in the late 1920s and early 1930s written by Austrian-American explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/1402958/Could-this-be-the-way-to-Shangri-La.html "Could This Be the Way to Shangri-La?"] by Timothy Carroll (29&amp;nbsp;July 2002). ''Electronic Telegraph''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaill completed a film based on their research, "Finding Shangri-La", which debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column where he reveals his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La and, if it is any place, it is more than 250&amp;nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.&lt;ref name="McRae"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Between 2002–2004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;

On 2&amp;nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, "Life in Shangri-La", in which Yan said that "Shangri-La" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops, local farmers as they harvest crops, and sampled their cuisine.

Television presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.
The Travel Channel recently aired an episode of Expedition Unknown that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas in search of Shangri-La. His findings are not necessarily proof that Shangri-La is or was real. However, the sky caves that are found do represent some interesting facts.

==In popular culture==
{{cruft|date=February 2017}}
There are a number of cultural usages of the Shangri-La idea that have developed since 1933 in the wake of the novel and the film made from it.

===In astronomy===
In 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] gave the equatorial, dark, low-lying area of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] the name [[Shangri-La (Titan)|Shangri-La]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Planetary Names: Albedo Feature: Shangri-La on Titan |work = Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |url = http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/6990 |accessdate = 2014-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gardens and resorts===
* In 1937 Lutcher Stark, a Texas philanthropist, started building his own [[Shangri La Botanical Gardens and Nature Center|Shangri-La]] in [[Orange, Texas]]. His Shangri-La was an [[azalea]] garden situated alongside a [[cypress]]-[[tupelo]] swamp. By 1950, thousands of people were travelling to Orange to visit Shangri-La, and many magazines published photographs of it. In 1958, a major snowstorm struck east Texas,&lt;ref name="Little Cyprus"&gt;{{cite web

===In film===
* California's [[Ojai, California|Ojai Valley]] was the location for the 1937 [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]''. The outdoor scenes of the villagers of Shangri-La and a cavorting [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Jane Wyatt]] were in fact filmed in nearby Sherwood Forest (Westlake Village) and [[Palm Springs]]. The exterior of the grand lamasery was built and later dismantled on the Columbia Ranch in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maroon.uchicago.edu/voices/articles/2002/04/23/doc_spotlight.php |website=uchicago.edu |title=Marooned |date=April 23, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419201101/http://maroon.uchicago.edu/voices/articles/2002/04/23/doc_spotlight.php |archivedate=2005-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to film historian Kendall Miller in the photodocumentary bonus feature on the ''Lost Horizon'' DVD, an aerial shot of Ojai Valley taken from an outlook on [[California State Route 150|Highway 150]] was used to represent the Shangri-La valley.

===In music===
{{references|section|date=November 2018}}
{{originalresearch|section|date=November 2018}}
[[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" contains the following lyrics: "Like Shangri-La beneath the summer moon / I will return again / As the dust that floats finds you / We're movin' through Kashmir."

"Shangri-La" is a song written by Ray Davies of The Kinks. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]''. The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.

Shangri-La also appears in the Oasis song "Idler's Dream", B-side to ''[[The Hindu Times]]''. The lyrics appear as: 
"And as I close my eyes,
And the sky turns red
I realise just what you are.
You're an idler's dream,
and you're singing Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la."

"Going to Shangri-La" is a song from Atlanta Rhythm Section

“This is Shangri-La” is a song on the album [[Apple (album)|''Apple'']] by [[Mother Love Bone]]. 

"Shangri-La" is a track on Billy Idol's 1993 album ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]''.

[[The Wraith: Shangri-La|''The Wraith: Shangri-La'']] is an album by the rap duo the [[Insane Clown Posse]].

"Helsinki–Shangri-La" is a 2010 single of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rapper]] [[Paleface (Finnish musician)|Paleface]].

"Shangri-La" is the final track on the album ''[[A New World Record]]'' by [[ELO]].

Electro-Acoustic Harpist and multi-instrumentalist, Gary Edward Drum, released his composition: "ENTERING SHANGRI-LA" on his 2013 album: ''The Utopia Within''.&lt;ref&gt;The Utopia Within by Gary Drum, July 8, 2013, Harpa Magica Unlimited&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 15 May 2017, Korean boyband [[VIXX]] released their song "Shangri-La" together with their 4th mini album, which has the same name.

The AC/DC song "Sin City" on the 1978 ''Powerage'' album, Shangri-la is mentioned with the lyrics "Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangrila"

Shangri-La is mentioned in the song “[[Dr. Feelgood (song)|Dr. Feelgood]]” by [[Mötley Crüe]], from the album of the same name. Shangri-La is included in the lyric “He’ll tell you he’s the king of these Barrio streets, movin’ up to Shangri-La”.

[[Stevie Nicks]]’ solo album ''[[Trouble in Shangri-La]]'' was released on May 1, 2001. Cover art features an oriental setting showing Nicks with her back to the camera looking out over an ocean.

English rock band [[Arctic Monkeys]] mentioned Shangri-La in the song "[[Suck It and See]]", from their fourth studio album, released on 6 June 2011 by Domino Recording Company. The lyrics appear as: 
"Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh"

==Usage==
Shangri-La is often used in a similar context to "[[Garden of Eden]]," to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive that is much sought. For a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's "Shangri-La." It also might be used to represent perfection that is sought by man in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of somewhat similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Inset shows the surrounding, black poplars growing on sandy [[loam]] on the bank of a [[bog pond|kolk]], with the detail area marked.]]

In [[biology]], a '''spore''' is a unit of [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] or [[asexual reproduction]] that may be adapted for [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of many [[plant]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/searchresults.html?cx=009557456284541951685%3A50nf_5tpvuq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=spore&amp;sa=Search Tree Of Life Web Project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial spore]]s are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. [[Myxozoa]]n spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.&lt;ref&gt;"Myxozoa." Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].

The spores of [[seed plant]]s, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.

==Definition==
The term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word σπορά ''spora'', meaning "[[seed]], sowing", related to σπόρος ''sporos'', "sowing," and σπείρειν ''speirein'', "to sow."

In common parlance, the difference between a "spore" and a "[[gamete]]" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.

The main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.

==Classification of spore-producing organisms==
===Plants===
[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. 

Heterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Isoëtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a "female" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a "male". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.

===Fungi===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are [[diploid]] cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.

==Classification of spores==
Spores can be classified in several ways:

===By spore-producing structure===
[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]
[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]
[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]
====Fungi====
In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular [[taxon]] of the [[fungi]].
* '''[[Sporangiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[sporangium]] in many fungi such as [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Zygospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[zygosporangium]], characteristic of [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Ascospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[ascus]], characteristic of [[ascomycete]]s.
* '''[[Basidiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[basidium]], characteristic of [[basidiomycete]]s.
* '''[[Aeciospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[aecium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Urediniospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[uredinium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Teliospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[telium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Oospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[oogonium]], characteristic of [[oomycete]]s.
====Red algae====
* '''[[Carpospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[carposporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].
* '''[[Tetraspore]]s''': spores produced by a [[tetrasporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].

===By function===
* '''[[Chlamydospore]]s''': thick-walled resting spores of [[fungi]] produced to survive unfavorable conditions.
* '''[[Fungal infection in plants|Parasitic fungal spores]]''' may be classified into internal spores, which germinate within the host, and external spores, also called environmental spores, released by the host to infest other hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |title=Microsporidia (Protozoa): A Handbook of Biology and Research Techniques |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626082941/http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |archivedate=26 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}. modares.ac.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===By origin during life cycle===
* '''Meiospores''': spores produced by [[meiosis]]; they are thus [[haploid]], and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of [[gametophyte]]s of [[seed plant]]s found in [[flower]]s ([[angiosperm]]s) or [[Conifer cone|cones]] ([[gymnosperm]]s), and the [[zoospore]]s produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''.
** '''[[Microspore]]s''': meiospores that give rise to a male [[gametophyte]], ([[pollen]] in seed plants).
** '''[[Megaspore]]s''' (or '''macrospores'''): meiospores that give rise to a female [[gametophyte]], (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the [[ovule]]).
* '''[[conidium|Mitospores]]''' (or '''conidia''', '''conidiospores'''): spores produced by [[mitosis]]; they are characteristic of [[Ascomycetes]]. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called "mitosporic fungi" or "anamorphic fungi", and are previously classified under the [[taxon]] [[Deuteromycota]] (See [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph]]).

===By mobility===
Spores can be differentiated by whether they can [[motility|move]] or not.
* '''[[Zoospore]]s''': mobile spores that move by means of one or more [[flagellum|flagella]], and can be found in some [[algae]] and [[fungi]].
* '''[[Aplanospore]]s''': immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella.
* '''[[Autospore]]s''': immobile spores that cannot develop flagella.
* '''[[Ballistospore]]s''': spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal [[fruiting body]] as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most [[basidiospore]]s are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus ''[[Pilobolus]]''.
* '''[[Statismospore]]s''': spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are [[puffball]]s.

==Anatomy==
Under high [[magnification]], spores can be categorized as either '''monolete spores''' or '''trilete spores'''. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.

==Dispersal==
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]

In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.&lt;ref name="Trail"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].&lt;ref name="Pringle et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].

In Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Lönnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.

In the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophylla | work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/replicating-sugarscape
|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Gilbert
|first1=Nigel
|last2=Bankes
|first2=Steven
|year=2002
|title=Platforms and Methods for Agent-Based Modelling

|volume=99
|issue=3
|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
