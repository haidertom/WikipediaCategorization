The original St John's Wood Art School dated from 1878.&lt;ref name="isaaman"&gt;{{cite web| title=Feature: Exhibition- Rediscovery of a chapter in London's art history — St John’s Wood Art School and The Anglo-French Art Centre — Boundary Gallery | url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/feature-exhibition-rediscovery-chapter-londons-art-history-st-john%E2%80%99s-wood-art-school-and-anglo-frenc | date=11 November 2010

Afterwards in 1946, Green established the centre at 29 Elm Tree Road in St John's Wood. Green aimed to revolutionise British [[art education]]. He invited artists from [[France]] and other countries to exhibit and teach. Artists included [[Robert Couturier (1905–2008)|Robert Couturier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jean Lurçat]], Agnès Capri and [[Germaine Richier]]. He was also supported by English artists who visited to give lectures, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Julian Trevelyan]]. Other lecturers included [[art critic]]s and [[museum director]]s. The centre closed in 1951.&lt;ref name="isaaman" /&gt;

An '''apple doll''' is a [[North America]]n [[cultural phenomenon]] where the [[doll|doll's]] head is made from dried [[apple]]s. The apple is peeled, then carved with the [[facial feature]]s of the doll. Next the apple is left to dry for several days or weeks. When completely dry, the apple is positioned on the top of a wire frame which is shaped into the rest of the doll's body. The rest of the wire frame is covered up by the doll's clothing, which is usually sewn by hand. In modern times, apple dolls are mostly used as [[Interior design|decoration]]s or to display [[Artisan|craftsmanship]], rather than as children's [[toys]]. Because of the different effects drying produces, no two dolls are alike.

{{Expert needed|Sociology|ex2=Anthropology|talk=Limited cultural and temporal context|reason=the article discusses bedtime stories only in the context of contemporary Western culture|date=January 2018}}
A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".&lt;ref name=institution&gt;Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;Jones, Patti (2011). [http://www.parents.com/fun/entertainment/books/the-brainy-benefits-of-bedtime-stories/ "The Brainy Benefits of Bedtime Stories"]. ''Parents Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[unselfishness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt; Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

'''''Bison Licking Insect Bite''''' is a [[prehistoric art|prehistoric carving]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], found at [[Abri de la Madeleine]] near [[Tursac]] in [[Dordogne]], France, the [[type-site]] of the [[Magdalenian]] culture, which produced many fine small carvings in antler or bone.

Created sometime between 20,000 and 12,000 [[Before present|BP]] (15,000 BP according to the museum), it was formerly in the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musee des Antiquites Nationales]], [[St. Germain-en-Laye]], but has been transferred to the expanded National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] that opened in 2004, not far from its findspot. It is a carved and engraved fragment of a [[spear-thrower]] made of [[reindeer]] antler. It depicts the figure of a [[bison]], of the now extinct species [[steppe wisent]] (''bison priscus'') with its head turned around and showing its tongue extended. It is thought the spear-thrower was broken into roughly its present shape before the carving was made from the fragment, hence the need to show the turned-back head of the animal in order to fit the existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant, "Collections", National Museum of Prehistory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045958/http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant%2C |date=2015-04-30 }} in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blason populaire''' is an umbrella [[genre]] in the field of [[folkloristics]] used to designate any item of any genre which makes use of [[stereotype]]s, usually, but not always, negative stereotypes, of a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lindahl, John McNamara, John Lindow, eds. Medieval Folklore: A Guide to Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;"These stereotypes are manifested in a wide array of folkloric genres, including proverbs, other traditional sayings, nicknames, jokes, songs, rhymes, and football chants. All share a common function in that they are invoked to highlight positive aspects of the in-group by explicit auto-stereotyping or, alternatively, to identify the negative characteristics of out-groups. The explicit positive stereotyping of an in-group may often implicitly suggest negative characteristics of a rival out-group."&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. 'The Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material'. ''Folklore'' 124, 2 (2013): 157-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''blasons populaires''  nations are homogeneous and have national characteristics.

Items such as [[joke#ethnic jokes|ethnic jokes]] or [[joke#blonde jokes|blonde jokes]] are very common examples of blason populaire.

== ''Blasons Populaires'' in Irish Proverbial Material ==

The Irish proverbial material is almost devoid of any national blasons populaires, with the possible exception of the multi-group international comparison. These comparisons are often manifested in epigrammatic form in European languages, with the most salient and representative stereotypical trait being attributed to the nations involved (what Billig (1995) refers to as ‘banal nationalism’). Enumerative structures, usually tri- or quadripartite formulas, are the favoured apparatus. The syntactic and semantic juxtaposition of negative traits for comparative purposes is then counter-balanced by the positive representation of one nation, usually in final position, most commonly the in-group that invokes the comparison. Below is a nineteenth-century German example (Reinsberg-Düringsfeld 1863, 5) in which there is no apparent in-group.

::''Die Italiener fluchen, Die Franzosen schreien, Die Engländer essen, Die Spanier trotzen, Und die Deutschen betrinken sich.''	
:::( The Italians curse, the French scream, the English eat, the Spanish defy, and the Germans get drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. An Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material’. Folklore 125  (2013): 1&lt;/ref&gt; )

==''Blasons populaires'' in Wallonia and Luxembourg &lt;ref&gt;http://belgique-sud-surnoms-des-habitants.skynetblogs.be/&lt;/ref&gt;==

In [[Wallonia]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Luxembourg]], the concept of "blason populaire" refers to a [[demonym]]-like [[nickname]] of the inhabitants of a village or a city.

''Blasons populaire'' come from the traditional languages ([[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Luxembourgish]]). They are never translated in French, as opposed to the [[demonym]]s which exist in [[French language|French]] and in Walloon, often in two different constructions.

Some, which have lost their pejorative meaning, are now used to name restaurants, theater groups, communal houses, etc. They are also used in [[pseudonym]]s of writers in Walloon.

==''Blasons populaires'' in Picardie and Nord-Pas-de-Calais==

The inhabitants of all villages or cities in these regions have a ''blason populaire'' (in [[Picard language]]: ''surpitchet'').&lt;ref&gt;(in French):  André Accart, ''Les sobriquets des habitants du Pas-de-Calais'', 456  pages, ( 2006 ) {{ISBN|2-915800-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the town of [[Amiens]] the blason is ''chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien'' ('the Eaters of Walnuts of Amiens').  In 1597, Spanish soldiers mounted [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|a surprise attack]]. They were disguised as peasants and put walnuts at the doors of the town. The inhabitants were famished and opened the doors, following which the Spanish soldiers entered the city; with deadly consequences for the inhabitants.

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]].

''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M. Slimani, and A. Aoues. "Toxic Effect of Lead on Kidney Function in Rat Wistar." African Journal of Biochemistry Research 4.2 (2010): 21–27. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
As of 2012, over 650 ceramic manufacturing establishments were reported in the United States.&lt;ref name="Division"/&gt; Floor tile, wall tile, sanitary-ware, bathroom accessories, kitchenware, and tableware are all potential ceramic-containing products that are available for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency.

=== Metal oxide chemistry ===
Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|Cr|2|O|3}} + 2CaO + {{frac|3|2}}{{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CaCrO|4}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

'''Child art''' is the drawings, paintings and other [[art]]istic works created by children.  It is also referred to as "children's art" or the "art of children".

=="Child art"==
In its primary sense the term was created by [[Franz Cižek]] (1865–1946) in the 1890s.

The term "child art" also has a parallel and different usage in the world of contemporary fine art, where it refers to a subgenre of artists who depict children in their works.

Third connotation of "child art" implies art intended for viewing by children, say illustrations in a book for juvenile readers. Such art could be done by a child or a professional adult illustrator.

==History==
Premises for understanding of importance of art for children were laid by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|J.-J. Rousseau]] (1712–78), [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|J.H. Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827), [[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903).

Agenda of [[art education]] for children was discussed at the International Conference of 1884, held in London at the Health Exhibition. The discussion framework was largely shaped by the widespread of schools of design for professional training of children and youth in the UK, beginning from 1852. Some of the conference participants underlined importance of creativity, imaginations and special methodology for development of children's artistic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 60-66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ebenezer Cooke (art education reformer)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1837–1913) has pointed out that "if a child follows its bent and draws animals its own way, in action, and repeats them, outlines them, and colours them too, he will produce a drawing which may be comparable to the archaic period of more than one historic school."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings of the conference, ed. by E. Cooke, were issued in the 1885–86 ''Journal of Education'', published by the Society for the Development of the Science of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

First European exhibition of drawings by children was organized by [[Robert Ablett]] (1848–1945) in London, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The first collection of 1250 children's drawing and sculpture pieces was assembled by [[:it:Corrado Ricci|Corrado Ricci]] (1858–1934), an Italian art historian.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic appreciation of children's art as untainted by adult influence was extolled by Franz Cižek, who called a child's drawing "a marvelous and precious document". Discovery of the aesthetic quality of the unskilled visual expression by children was related to the aesthetics of [[modernism]] and, in case of Cižek, to the [[Vienna Secession]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 82–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Cižek opened the Juvenile Art Class, a weekend school upholding children creativity uninhibited by adult vocational standards. The initiative was supported by his Secession friends-artists and opposed by the traditional art teachers. The Class accepted pupils of 2 to 14 years old for two hours a week, free of charge, with no selection. Cižek claimed that he was working "as an artist, not as a teacher", and actually "learned and not taught". In the work, the theory of developmental stages was propagated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 83-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists' interest in children's art was reflected in works by [[Georg Kerschensteiner]] (Die Entwickelung der Zeichnerischen Begabung, 1905, on the grounds of analysis of some 100 000 drawings), [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] (''Les Dessins D’un Enfant'', 1912, using 1500 drawings of the author's daughter from 3 to 8 years old), [[Georges Rouma]] (''Le Langage Graphique de l’Enfant'', Paris, 1913), [[Karl Bühler]] (1918 ff.), [[Florence Goodenough]], [[Helga Eng]], [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]]. According to D.D. Kelly, consequent domination of [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|Piagetian]] theory of cognitive psychology largely marginalized the psychological studies of children's art, which were revitalized only towards the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 93-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of child art==
As the child develops, their art passes through a number of stages. 4 of them were for the first time defined by E. Cooke, under influence of Herbert Spencer's evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the stages are generally differentiated as follows:

===Scribbling===
[[File:ChildArt scrib.theora.ogv|thumb|scribbling]]
[[Image:Child scribble age 1y10m.jpg|thumb|[[Scribble]] by one-year-old.]]
From about their first birthday children achieve the fine motor control to handle a [[crayon]]. At first they scribble. The youngest child scribbles with a series of left and right motions, later up, down and then circular motions are added. The child appears to get considerable pleasure from watching the line or the [[colour]]s appear. Often however children do not pay attention to the edges of the page and the lines go beyond the confines of the page.  Children are often also interested in [[body painting]] and, given the opportunity, will draw on their hands or smear paint on their faces.

Later, from about their second birthday, controlled scribbling starts. Children produce patterns of simple shapes: circles, crosses and star-bursts. They also become interested in arrangement and can produce simple collages of coloured paper, or place stones in patterns. Once children have established controlled scribbling they begin to name their scribbles.

===Pre-symbolism===
[[Image:Child Art Aged 4.5 Person 2.png|thumb|Smiling person (combined head and body) age 4½]]

From about age three, the child begins to combine circles and lines to make simple figures. At first, people are drawn without a body and with arms emerging directly from the head. The eyes are often drawn large, filling up most of the face, and hands and feet are omitted. At this stage it may be impossible to identify the subject of the art without the child's help.

Later drawings from this stage show figures drawn floating in space and sized to reflect the child's view of their importance. Most children at this age are not concerned with producing a realistic picture.

===Symbolism===
[[Image:Birch bark document 210.jpg|thumb|[[Birch bark document]] 202,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gramoty.ru/index.php?no=202&amp;act=full&amp;key=bb|title=Древнерусские берестяные грамоты. Грамота №202|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing symbolic drawing of people, age 6-7
([[Onfim]])
]]

In this stage of a child's development, they create a vocabulary of images. Thus when a child draws a picture of a cat, they will always draw the same basic image, perhaps modified (this cat has stripes that one has dots, for example). This stage of drawing begins at around age five. The basic shapes are called [[symbol]]s or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].

Each child develops his/her own set of symbols, which are based on their understanding of what is being drawn rather than on observation. Each child's symbols are therefore unique to the child. By this age, most children develop a "person" symbol which has a properly defined head, trunk and limbs which are in some sort of rough proportion.

[[Image:Faroe stamp 041 childrens year (children of different skin colour).jpg|thumb|Two schematic figures on a green base line]]
Before this stage the objects that child would draw would appear to float in space, but at about five to six years old the child introduces a baseline with which to organize their space. This baseline is often a green line (representing grass) at the bottom of the paper. The figures stand on this line. Slightly older children may also add secondary baselines for background objects and a skyline to hold the sun and clouds.

It is at this stage that cultural influences become more important. Children not only draw from life, but also copy images in their surroundings. They may draw copies of cartoons. Children also become more aware of the [[Narrative|story]]-telling possibilities in a picture. The earliest understanding of a more realistic representation of space, such as using perspective, usually comes from copying.

===Realism===
As children mature they begin to find their symbols limiting. They realize that their schema for a person is not flexible enough, and just doesn't look like the real thing. At this stage, which begins at nine or ten years old, the child will lend greater importance to whether the drawing looks like the object being drawn.
[[Image:Luckpine.jpg|thumb|Artwork by 9 year old (Rafael Mesa)]]
This can be a frustrating time for some children, as their aspirations outstrip their abilities and knowledge. Some children give up on drawing almost entirely. However others become skilled, and it is at this stage that formal artistic training can benefit the child most. The baseline is dropped and the child can learn to use rules such as [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] to organize space better. Story-telling also becomes more refined and children will start to use formal devices such as the comic strip.

==Therapeutic==
[[Art therapy]] can be an effective way for children to develop and connect with their emotions. Some children with [[autism]] have found that drawing can help them to express feelings that they have difficulty expressing otherwise. Similarly children who have faced horrors such as war can find it difficult to talk about what they have experienced directly. Art can help children come to terms with their emotions in these situations.

==Criticism==
After visiting a children's art display in San Francisco in the 1980s, educator [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] stated that, "...An understanding of [[adultism]] might begin to explain what I mean when I say that much of what is known as children's art is an adult invention."&lt;ref&gt;Holt, J. (Ed) ''Teach your own: The John Holt book of homeschooling.'' Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contour drawing''', is an artistic technique used in the field of [[art]] in which the [[artist]] sketches the contour of a subject by drawing lines that result in a drawing that is essentially an outline; the [[French language|French]] word contour meaning, “outline.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=contour&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of contour drawing is to emphasize the [[mass]] and [[volume]] of the subject rather than the [[Complexity|detail]]; the focus is on the outlined shape of the subject and not the minor details. However, because contour can convey a three-dimensional [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], length and width as well as thickness and depth are important; not all contours exist along the outlines of a subject.&lt;ref name="sutherland"&gt;Sutherland, Jane. 1997. "Gesture drawings." American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 61, no. 656: 11. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is manifested in different styles and practiced in drawing development and learning.

==Importance==
Contour drawing is an essential technique in the field of art because it is a strong foundation for any drawing or [[painting]]; it can potentially modify a subjects’ form through variation within the lines. Its objective is to capture the life, action, or expression of the subject.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; It is widely accepted among schools, art institutions, and colleges as an effective training aid and discipline&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaïdes, Kimon. 1941. "The Natural Way to Draw". Houghton Mifflin Company Boston&lt;/ref&gt; for beginner artists. In the hands of a talented master, the line that conveys contour can deliver an astonishing amount of visual delight.

==Technique==
In a continuous-line drawing, the artist looks both at the subject and the paper, moving the [[medium (communication)|medium]] over the paper, and creating a [[silhouette]] of the object. Like [[blind contour drawing]], contour drawing is an artful experience that relies more on sensation than perception; it’s important to be guided by instinct.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; To make a blind contour drawing, an artist does not look at the paper or [[canvas]] on which he/she is working.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; Another technique similar to contour drawing is outline drawing; a division between form and the space a subject occupies.&lt;ref name="sheenan"&gt;Sheenan, Steven. 1994. "Two types of line drawings." American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 58, no. 625: 10. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; All three types of drawing are considered to be [[gesture]] drawings;&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt; the practice of drawing a series of bodies in still form. An outline drawing does not include the visual amusement of human sight, while a contour drawing contains form, weight, mass, space, and distance.&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt;

==Styles==
By altering the character of the mark, an artist can emulate many aspects of the subject that relate form and space to the viewer. For example, a line can be lighter in value ([[Gradation (art)|gradation]]) to suggest greater distance between objects in the drawing. A darker portion of the contour could represent an object with little or no light source; the space is compressed or the object is lower.&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt; Continuous lines used inside the outline of a subject can add accent or cast shadow, depending on the value of the line.

==Practice==
The purpose of drawing blindly is to force the artist’s eye to move along the contour of the subject as his or her pencil moves along the paper. Initially, this type of drawing may be difficult and slow, but an artist will find that with practice, it is an effective way of defining observation skills such as identifying and underlying the structure of the subject, relating [[form (visual art)|form]]s, and conveying the sensual experience of the subject. Through thorough practice in this style, he/she will be skilled at drawing anything quickly and successively.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">A '''cultural manager''' ({{lang-es|'''gestor cultural'''}}) is a person who is motivated by the improvement of [[art]], works independently and professionally with knowledge of the subject, and develops work as a mediator between governmental and/or private cultural institutions with artists from different areas to articulate their work in the market with promotion and national and international dissemination.&lt;ref name=uoc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gestiocultural.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/06/28/que-es-un-gestor-cultural-gestion-cultural/ |title=¿Qué es un gestor cultural? |trans-title=What is a Cultural Manager? |publisher=[[Open University of Catalonia]] |language=Spanish |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural manager works by looking for specific measures of success, always intending to improve the level of culture, seeking active cohesion between society, the governmental sector, the private sector, and the artists. The work of culture management poses learning challenges in diverse areas such as the administration of economic resources, training, and artistic communication.&lt;ref name=uoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.educaweb.com/profesion/gestor-cultural-334/ |title=Gestor cultural |publisher=Educaweb |language=Spanish |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural management is a new profession. A person who is dedicated to this work is characterized by having abilities to visualize and interpret talent, knowing how to establish a dialogue with artists to link them to cultural projects to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hHxeCA_ecYC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Gestión cultural: Entre conceptos lejanos y realidades cercanas |trans-title=Cultural Management: Between Distant Concepts and Nearby Realities |chapter=Acercando realidades a través de la gestión cultural |trans-chapter=Bringing Together Realities Through Cultural Management |first1=Silvia |last1=Aballay |first2=Carla Fernanda |last2=Avendaño Manelli |publisher=Eduvim |isbn=9789871518968 |pages=13-16 |language=Spanish |year=2010 |access-date=18 April 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Dalle de verre''', from French: "glass slab", is a [[glass art]] technique that uses pieces of coloured glass set in a matrix of [[concrete]] and [[epoxy|epoxy resin]] or other supporting material. 

==Technique==
The technique was developed by [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] in Paris in the 1930s. Slabs of coloured glass, {{convert|20|cm|inch}} to {{convert|30|cm|inch}} square or rectangular and typically up to {{convert|3|cm|inch}} thick, are shaped by breaking with a hammer or cutting with a saw. The edges of the resulting pieces may be chipped or faceted to increase the [[refraction]] and [[Specular reflection|reflection]] effects.

The pieces are laid out to a design, similar to traditional [[stained-glass]] work. The pieces are laid on a bed of sand, bounded by a wooden casting frame. A matrix material, sand and cement or epoxy resin, is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The visible glass faces are then cleaned and the resulting solid panel can be relocated, embedded or hung as required.

The use of thicker glass produces deeper colour effects than traditional [[lead]] [[came]] stained-glass, especially when illuminated by bright natural or artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vitraildutemple.free.fr/realisations/dalle.html |title= La dalle de verre |language=french |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osvaldsstainedglass.com/portfolio/dalle-de-verre-technique/| title=Dalle de Verre Technique |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique achieved prominence in the stained glass literature of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |first=Lacey |last=Bubnash |work=Thesis Abstract |title=Dalle de Verre / Faceted Glass: New Approaches to a Modern Material |publisher=[[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|School of Architecture]], [[Columbia University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510140934/http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and conservation==
The resulting works may be subject to structural problems over time and, just like more traditional stained glass works, pose challenges to conservators and restorers.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"/&gt;

==Dalle de verre in the UK==
Dalle de verre was brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux who joined [[James Powell and Sons]] (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956 and trained [[Dom Charles Norris]] in the technique. Norris was a Dominican Friar who went on to become arguably the most prolific British proponent of dalle de verre. His work is incorporated in several Modernist listed Catholic churches.

'''Defamiliarization''' or '''''ostranenie''''' ({{lang-rus|остранение|p=ɐstrɐˈnʲenʲɪjə}}) is the [[art]]istic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way &lt;!--typically (is it also used for other rasons / without an explicit intention?)--&gt;in order to enhance perception of the familiar.

== History ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to (De Guzman, 2016), Defamiliarization of that which is or has become familiar or taken for granted, hence automatically perceived, is the basic function of all devices. And with defamiliarization come both the slowing down and the increased difficulty (impeding) of the process of reading and comprehending and an awareness of the artistic procedures (devices) causing them.  (Margolin 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "defamiliarization" was first coined in 1917 by [[Viktor Shklovsky]] in his essay "Art as Device" (alternate translation: "Art as Technique") (Crawford 209).  Shklovsky invented the term as a means to "distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former's perceptibility" (Crawford 209).  Essentially, he is stating that [[poetic language]] is fundamentally different than the language that we use every day because it is more difficult to understand:  "Poetic speech is ''formed speech''.  [[Prose]] is ordinary speech – economical, easy, proper, the goddess of prose [''dea prosae''] is a goddess of the accurate, facile type, of the "direct" expression of a child" (Shklovsky 20).  This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of "over-automatization," which causes an individual to "function as though by formula" (Shklovsky 16).  This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known.  The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. (Shklovsky 16) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, defamiliarization serves as a means to force individuals to recognize artistic language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In studying poetic speech in its phonetic and [[Word|lexical]] structure as well as in its characteristic distribution of words and in the characteristic thought structures compounded from the words, we find everywhere the artistic trademark – that is, we find material obviously created to remove the automatism of perception; the author's purpose is to create the vision which results from that deautomatized perception.  A work is created "artistically" so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception.  (Shklovsky 19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This technique is meant to be especially useful in distinguishing poetry from prose, for, as [[Aristotle]] said, "poetic language must appear strange and wonderful" (Shklovsky 19).

=== In Russian literature ===

To illustrate what he means by defamiliarization, Shklovsky uses examples from [[Tolstoy]], whom he cites as using the technique throughout his works: "The narrator of '[[Kholstomer]],' for example, is a horse, and it is the horse's point of view (rather than a person's) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar" (Shklovsky 16).  As a Russian Formalist, many of Shklovsky's examples use Russian authors and Russian dialects: "And currently [[Maxim Gorky]] is changing his diction from the old literary language to the new literary colloquialism of [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]].  Ordinary speech and literary language have thereby changed places (see the work of [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and many others)" (Shklovsky 19-20).

Defamiliarization also includes the use of foreign languages within a work.  At the time that Shklovsky was writing, there was a change in the use of language in both [[literature]] and everyday spoken Russian.  As Shklovsky puts it: "Russian literary language, which was originally foreign to [[Russia]], has so permeated the language of the people that it has blended with their conversation.  On the other hand, literature has now begun to show a tendency towards the use of dialects and/or barbarisms" (Shklovsky 19).

=== Différance ===

Shklovsky's defamiliarization can also be compared to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s concept of [[différance]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Shklovskij wants to show is that the operation of defamiliarization and its consequent perception in the literary system is like the winding of a watch (the introduction of energy into a physical system): both "originate" difference, change, value, motion, presence.  Considered against the general and functional background of Derridian différance, what Shklovskij calls "perception" can be considered a matrix for production of difference.  (Crawford 212) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since the term différance refers to the dual meanings of the [[French language|French]] word difference to mean both "to differ" and "to defer", defamiliarization draws attention to the use of common language in such a way as to alter one's perception of an easily understandable object or concept.  The use of defamiliarization both differs and defers, since the use of the technique alters one's perception of a concept (to defer), and forces one to think about the concept in different, often more complex, terms (to differ).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shklovskij's formulations negate or cancel out the existence/possibility of a "real" perception: variously, by (1) the familiar Formalist denial of a link between literature and life, connoting their status as non-communicating vessels, (2) always, as if compulsively, referring to a real experience in terms of empty, dead, and automatized repetition and recognition, and (3) implicitly locating real perception at an unspecifiable temporally anterior and spatially other place, at a mythic "first time" of naïve experience, the loss of which to automatization is  to be restored by aesthetic perceptual fullness. (Crawford 218)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Uncanny ===

The influence of Russian Formalism on twentieth-century art and culture is largely due to the literary technique of defamiliarization or ‘making strange’, and has also been linked to Freud’s notion of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, Nicholas.  ''The Uncanny''.  New York: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Das Unheimliche'' ("The Uncanny"),&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.  ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Volume XVII.  Ed. James Strachey.  London: Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud states that “the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar,” however, this is not a fear of the unknown, but more of a feeling about something being both strange and familiar (220).  The connection between ''ostranenie'' and the uncanny can be seen where Freud muses on the technique of literary uncanniness: “It is true that the writer creates a kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation” (230).  When “the writer pretends to move in the world of common reality,” they can situate supernatural events, such as the animation of inanimate objects, in the quotidian, day-to-day reality of the modern world, defamiliarizing the reader and provoking an uncanny feeling (250).

== Usage ==
The technique appears in English Romantic poetry, particularly in the poetry of [[Wordsworth]], and was defined in the following way by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'': "To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar ... this is the character and privilege of genius." 
 
In more recent times, it has been associated with the poet and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], whose [[Verfremdungseffekt]] ("estrangement effect") was a potent element of his approach to theater. In fact, as Willett points out, Verfremdungseffekt is "a translation of the Russian critic Viktor Shklovskij's phrase 'Priem Ostranenija', or 'device for making strange'".&lt;ref&gt;(Willett, John.  ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''.  New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht, in turn, has been highly influential for artists and filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard and Yvonne Rainer.

A '''design director''' is a position usually found within the [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], [[automotive]] or [[entertainment industry|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well. The position has similarities to that of a [[creative director]]. The design director oversees the design of [[brand]]ing and advertising for a client, ensuring that the new branding and advertising fits in with the client's requirements and the image they wish to promote for their company or product. However, unlike a creative director, the design director is not responsible for the overall quality of the final creative work, but merely for the quality of the project's design elements.

Another distinction between the two positions is that advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from [[senior designer]] positions.

The area known as DUMBO used to be known as Gairville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= David W. |last= Dunlap| title= SoHo, TriBeCa And Now Dumbo? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/realestate/soho-tribeca-and-now-dumbo.html |work= New York Times |date=October 25, 1998 | accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses two sections: one located between the [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn Bridge]]s, which connect Brooklyn to [[Manhattan]] across the [[East River]], and another that continues east from the Manhattan Bridge to the [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]] area. The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

The name is an [[acronym]] of "Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass". Several other New York City neighborhoods are known by [[portmanteau]]s, including [[Tribeca]], [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]], [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], [[NoMad]], and [[Nolita]] in Manhattan, and [[BoCoCa]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="dolkart"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dolkart |first1=Andrew S. |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/DUMBO_Designation_Report.pdf |title=DUMBO Historic District Designation Report |publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 6, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

==History==
The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dumbo |url=http://dumbonyc.com/about |work=Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn |publisher=DumboNYC.com |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olympia" name came from [[Comfort Sands|Comfort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]], who bought the land in 1787&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Olympia Settlement in Early Brooklyn|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1929|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of American Biography|last = Johnson|first = Allen|publisher = Charles Scribner’s Sons|year = 1964|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]].&lt;ref name="HISTORICAL DISTRICTS 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966|title=HISTORICAL DISTRICTS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20780654|journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

The DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] in Dumbo, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included [[Benjamin Moore &amp; Co.]] (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W.

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996).

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===

''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of "vital'' qi''". Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital'' qi'' by appropriate siting of graves and structures.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"/&gt; Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/arts/200908/t20090810_1079619.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|work=stnn.cc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 房山金陵探寻_秦关汉土征未还_洪峰_博联社] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181644/http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_01/11/293453_77.shtml|title=凤凰网读书频道|work=ifeng.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html 蒋介石挖毛泽东祖坟的玄机] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620232203/http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |title=丧心病狂中国历史上六宗罕见的辱尸事 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061329/http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |archive-date=2007-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Cody. Striking a Harmonious Chord: Foreign Missionaries and Chinese-style Buildings, 1911–1949. ''Architronic''. 5:3 (ISSN 1066-6516)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M. Holson, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/business/worldbusiness/the-feng-shui-kingdom.html "The Feng Shui Kingdom"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

The '''golden apple''' is an element that appears in various national and ethnic [[folk legends]] or [[fairy tales]]. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example [[Hercules]] or [[Făt-Frumos]]) retrieving the golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]]s hidden or stolen by a monstrous [[antagonist]]. Alternatively, they are depicted as divine food and the source of [[immortality]] in [[Norse mythology]], and as part of the mysterious [[Silver Branch|apple branch]] of [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] in [[Irish mythology]].

== Greek mythology ==
Three instances of golden apples were featured in [[Greek mythology]]:

===Atalanta===
{{Main article|Atalanta}}
[[Image:Guido Reni - Atalanta e Ippomene (Napoli).jpg|thumb|left|340px|''Atalanta and Melanion'', [[Guido Reni]], c. 1622&amp;ndash;25]]

The first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named [[Melanion]].  Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar.  Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off.  However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall.  Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace.  Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death.  As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to [[Aphrodite]] for help.  The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta.  Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple.  It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the Seven against Thebes.  Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.

===Golden Apple of Trojan War Fable===
{{Main article|Judgement of Paris|Apple of Discord}}
[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|390px|[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|''El Juicio de Paris'']] by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is holding the golden apple on his right hand while surveying the goddesses in a calculative manner.]]

[[Zeus]] held a [[banquet]] in celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read:  "ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ" ({{lang-grc|τῇ καλλίστῃ|translit=tē(i) kallistē(i)}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: τη καλλίστη ''ti kallisti''; "for/to the most beautiful" – cf. [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]). Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to [[Ares]] after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.

Zeus gave the apple to [[Hermes]] and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the [[Trojan war]], and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.

=== Heracles ===
See [[Labours_of_Hercules#Eleventh_labour:_apples_of_the_Hesperides|Apples of the Hesperides]]

==Norse mythology==
[[Image:Ring5.jpg|right|thumb|[[Freia]], from ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', with the tree of golden apples]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the golden apples are the source of the gods' immortality and perpetual youth; comparable to the role of [[ambrosia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. They are cultivated by—and most often associated with—the goddess [[Iðunn]].

===In myth===
In the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', Iðunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight [[Æsir|ásynjur]] (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in [[Asgard]] for [[Ægir]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES59&gt;Faulkes (1995:59).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 56, [[Bragi]] tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the [[jötunn]] [[Þjazi]]. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, [[Loki]] finds himself stuck to the bird, and being pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees, and he felt his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouted and begged the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would only be freed if he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts and returns to his friends [[Odin]] and [[Hœnir]]. At the time the Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into "a certain forest", telling her that he had discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples Loki discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her, and takes her to his home, [[Þrymheimr]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES60&gt;Faulkes (1995:60).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Iðunn. The Æsir hold an assembly [[thing (assembly)|thing]], where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the assembly, where he is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that he will search for Iðunn in the land of [[Jötunheimr]] if the goddess [[Freyja]] will lend him her "[[falcon]] shape". Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr, and arrives a day later at Þjazi's home. Loki finds that Þjazi is out in a boat at sea, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

Upon Þjazi's arrival home, he finds that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi assumes his eagle shape, and chases after Loki, causing a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, as well as the pursuing eagle, so they go outside from Asgard, with loads of wood shavings. The falcon flies over the fortification, and drops down by the wall. The eagle is unable to stop when he misses the falcon, the feathers of the eagle catch fire, and he falls. The Æsir, close by, kill the jötunn Þjazi within the gates of Asgard, "and this killing is greatly renowned."&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

==Irish mythology==
The role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in [[Irish mythology|Irish lore]], mostly because it is an element of the [[Silver Branch]], or ''Silver Bough'', symbol that is connected to the [[Celtic Otherworld]].

===Apple branch===
Described in [[The Voyage of Bran]] as "a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; it is said that "to enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch,"&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus continuing the apple's divine connection found in Greek and Norse myth.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This connection is particularly strong regarding the Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] and Otherworld guardian [[Manannán mac Lir]], as evidenced in the tale [[His Three Calls to Cormac]]. In this story Manannán gifts a "branch of silver with three golden apples" to King [[Cormac mac Airt]] and, when shaken, these golden apples produced a music that could put anybody to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth. Irl., pp. 326–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac – http://www.manannan.net/library/Lady%20Gregory/His%20Three%20Calls%20to%20Cormac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory1"&gt;Gregory, Lady Augusta (1903) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm21.htm online "Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac"] in ''Gods and Fighting Men''. Buckinghamshire, Colyn Smyth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Joseph. "The Fate of the Children of Lir." More Celtic Fairy Tales. Illustrated by John D. Batten. London: David Nutt, 1894. 204–209. – http://www.luminarium.org/mythology/ireland/cormacfairy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Fighting Men – The Story of the Tuatha De Danaan and of the Fianna of Ireland, arranged and put into English by  Lady Gregory with a preface by W.B. Yeats (1905) – Chapter XI. His Three Calls to Cormac – https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L22&lt;/ref&gt; This gift however, was conditional in that the price was the King's family and, though they are eventually restored to him, Manannán used to silver branch of golden apples as the means to teach Cormac a harsh lesson. In addition, in her ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods and Fighting Men, Lady Gregory |year=1904 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] describes Manannán's gift as a "shining branch having nine apples of red gold."&lt;ref name="Gregory1"/&gt;

==Music==
In [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the golden apples have their own [[leitmotif]]. It is first sung by [[Fafnir|Fafner]], when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.

In [[Stravinsky]]'s ballet [[The Firebird]] (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).

==Fairy tales==
[[Image:Firebird.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]] catches the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]] who tries to steal golden apples in ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'']]
Many European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:
*"[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]" (Russian)
*"[[The Golden Bird]]" (German)
*"[[The Golden Mermaid]]" (German)
*"[[The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples]]" (Serbian/Bulgarian)
*"[[Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples]]" (Romanian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmeu]])
*"[[The Three Brothers and the Golden Apple]]" (Bulgarian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmey]])
*"[[The White Snake]]" (German)

==Modern literature==
The [[William Butler Yeats]] poem "The Song of the Wandering Aengus", has the lines:
:''I will find out where she has gone''
:''And kiss her lips and take her hands;''
:''And walk among long dappled grass,''
:''And pluck till time and times are done''
:''The silver apples of the moon,''
:''The golden apples of the sun.''

The [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] play called ''The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children'' is a fable in the invented [[Kiltartan]] dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.

''The Golden Apples'' is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.

A golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] sixth novel ''[[The Bone Clocks]]'', published by Random House in 2014.

==Discordianism==
The contemporary religion [[Discordianism]] draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], also known as the "Apple of Discord", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the [[Trojan War]] because she was not invited to a party (the so-called "Original Snub". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word "''[[Kallisti]]''" ("to the fairest").&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/24.php |title=Page 17-18 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause [[cognitive dissonance]] in the target.

==Identity and use in other languages==

===Argan fruit===
Michael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the [[Argania|Argan tree]], endemic to the [[Sous Valley]] in present-day [[Morocco]], may be the golden apples of the [[Hesperides (poetry)|Hesperides]]. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of [[Atlantis]] and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce [[Argan oil]], with [[Plato]]'s account of Atlantean fruits "which afford liquid and solid food and unguents", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Hübner|title=Circumstantial Evidence for Plato's Island Atlantis in the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-Morocco|url=http://asalas.org/papers/Huebner_Atlantis_Circumstantial_Evidence_full.pdf|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oranges===
In many languages, the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] is referred to as a "golden apple". For example, the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''χρυσομηλιά,'' and [[Latin]] ''pomum aurantium'' both literally describe oranges as "golden apples". Other languages, like [[German language|German]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], have more complex [[etymologies]] for the word "orange" that can be traced back to the same idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Citr_sin.html#etym ''Orange (Citrus sinensis [L.&amp;#93; Osbeck) Etymology''], Gernot Katzer, [http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/index.html Gernot Katzer Spice Pages], formerly [[University of Graz]], February 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years it was thought that the "golden apples" of myth might have actually been [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], a fruit unknown to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] before the [[Middle Ages]]. Under this assumption, the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[botanical]] name chosen for all [[citrus]] species was ''Hesperidoeidē'' (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, "hesperidoids"). It was also used by [[Carl Linnaeus]], who gave the name Hesperides to an [[order (biology)|order]] containing the [[genus]] Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term [[Hesperidium]] for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.

One reason why oranges might be considered to be "magical" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Quinces===
Frequently, the term "golden apple" is used to refer to the [[quince]], a fruit originating in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.saucemagazine.com/a/890 |title=Quince, the 'Golden Apple'| author=Arnot, Sharon | work= Sauce Magazine|date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomatoes===
The [[tomato]], unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the ''pomodoro'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "golden apple" (from ''pomo d'oro'').{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Popular Culture==
Golden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as *[[Minecraft]]&lt;ref&gt;https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Apple&lt;/ref&gt; and *[[Hello Neighbor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helloneighbor.gamepedia.com/Apple|website=helloneighbor.gamepedia.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery Bruegel.jpg|thumb|270px|''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1565, {{convert|24| x |34|cm|abbr=on}}]]
[[File:Del sarto Battesimo della gente.jpg|thumb|270px|''Battesimo della gente'', one of [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s gray and brown grisaille [[fresco]]es in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, [[Florence]] (1511-26).]]

A '''grisaille''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|eɪ|l}}; {{lang-fr|gris}} {{IPA-fr|ɡʁizaj|}} 'grey') is a [[painting]] executed entirely in shades of grey or of another neutral greyish colour.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly used in large decorative schemes in imitation of sculpture. Many grisailles include a slightly wider colour range, like the [[Andrea del Sarto]] fresco illustrated. Paintings executed in brown are referred to as [[brunaille]], and paintings executed in green are called [[verdaille]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grisaille may be executed for its own sake, as [[underpainting]] for an [[oil painting]] (in preparation for glazing layers of colour over it), or as a [[Physical model|model]] for an [[engraver]] to work from. "Rubens and his school sometimes use monochrome techniques in sketching compositions for engravers."&lt;ref&gt;'''Oxford Companion to Art.''' Ed. Harold Osborne; Clarendon Press. Oxford, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Full colouring of a subject makes many more demands of an artist, and working in grisaille was often chosen as being quicker and cheaper, although the effect was sometimes deliberately chosen for aesthetic reasons. Grisaille paintings resemble the [[drawing]]s, normally in monochrome, that artists from the Renaissance on were trained to produce; like drawings they can also betray the hand of a less talented assistant more easily than a fully coloured painting.

==History==
[[File:Hans Memling 016.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Hans Memling]] wing, with [[donor portrait]] in colour below grisaille Madonna imitating sculpture.]]
[[Giotto]] used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], and [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of [[triptych]]s, including the [[Ghent Altarpiece]]. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However today these images are often invisible in museums when the tryptych is displayed open and flat against a wall. In these cases imitation of sculpture was intended; sculpture was still more expensive than a painting even by a top master.

[[Illuminated manuscript]]s had often been produced in pen and [[watercolour|wash]] with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as [[Jean Pucelle]] and [[Matthew Paris]] specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] times. Renaissance artists such as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]] often used grisaille as a classicising effect, either in imitation of the effect of a classical [[sculpture]]d relief, or of [[Ancient Roman art|Roman painting]].

In the Low Countries a continuous tradition of grisaille paintings can be traced from [[Early Netherlandish painting]] to [[Martin Heemskerck]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] (''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'') and [[Hendrik Goltzius]], and through the copious output of [[Adriaen van de Venne]], to the circle of [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jan van Goyen]].

The ceiling [[fresco]]es of the [[Sistine Chapel]] have portions of the design in grisaille, as does the lower part of the great staircase decoration by [[Antonio Verrio]] at [[Hampton Court]].

=== Modern examples ===

Grisaille, while less widespread in the 20th Century, continues as an artistic technique. [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso's]] painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' is one contemporary example.

[[Hugo Bastidas]] is a contemporary American painter known for black and white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black and white photographs.&lt;ref name = carvalho&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Carvalho|first1=Denise|title=Hugo Bastidas at Nohra Haime|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2008|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastidas’ paintings frequently reference architecture, water, vegetation and art history, and reflect his concern about [[The Human Condition|the human condition]], [[globalization]], and their effect on the Earth’s well-being.&lt;ref name = gallerybio&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.nohrahaimegallery.com/hugo-bastidas.html|publisher=Nohra Haime Gallery|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to New York from a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in his native Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt; His medium- and large-scale paintings allude to black-and-white photography, and feature contrasting zones of high and low detail.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Jessica|title=Without Hue: A Rainbow of Grays|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/12/14/without-hue-a-rainbow-of-grays/23de1b30-cba4-4f12-bb05-bd11f9fda6ac/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's bristle brush on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieves a high level of image definition.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardier|first1=Laura|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=http://www.artealdia.com/International/Contents/Reviews/Hugo_Bastidas|publisher=Arte Al Dia|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.mattmuseum.org/exhibition/hugo-bastidas/|publisher=Mattatuck Museum|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
With the 20th century's emphasis on direct (''[[alla prima]]'') painting, the grisaille technique lost favour with artists of the period. This historic method is still incorporated into the curriculum of some private [[studio|ateliers]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at The Contemporary Realist Academy, in Memphis, Tennessee, The Ryder Studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Ecole Albert Defois in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In enamel and stained glass==
[[File:Magi Herod MNMA Cl23532.jpg|thumb|140px|Grisaille stained glass (15th century)]]
The term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], where an effect similar to a [[relief]] in silver may be intended. It is common in [[stained glass]], where the need for sections in different colours was thereby greatly reduced. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille — using, for example, [[silver stain]] or vitreous paint — while other sections are done in coloured glass.

The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent. N.p., Mar. 2012. Web. 22 Oct. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses have appeared in works of art throughout history, frequently as depictions of the [[Horses in warfare|horse in battle]]. The horse appears less frequently in modern art partly because the horse is no longer significant either as a mode of transportation or as an implement of war. Most modern representations are of famous contemporary horses, artwork associated with horse racing, or artwork associated with the historic [[cowboy]] or [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] tradition of the American west. In the United Kingdom depictions of [[fox hunting]] and nostalgic rural scenes involving horses continue to be made.

Horses often appear in artworks singly, as a mount for an important person, or in teams, hitched to a variety of [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s.

==History==
{{see also|Trojan horse|Leonardo's horse}}
===Prehistory and the Ancient World===
[[File:Bronze Statuette of a Horse.jpg|thumb|''Bronze Statuette of a Horse,'' late 2nd – 1st century B.C. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The horse appeared in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[Lascaux]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lascaux.culture.fr/#/en/00.xml Lascaux caves official website.(retrieved 09/09/2011[[Lascaux]])]&lt;/ref&gt; estimated to be 16,000 years old.

Prehistoric [[hill figure]]s have been carved in the shape of the horse, specifically the [[Uffington White Horse]], an example of the tradition of horse carvings upon hill-sides, which having existed for thousands of years continues into the current age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/britainfromabove/stories/secrets/whitehorse.shtml  BBC video.Retrieved 09/09/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upper Palaeolithic]] [[Vogelherd_Cave#Vogelherd_figurines|Vogelherd figurines]] discovered in Germany, miniature sculptures made of [[mammoth]] [[ivory]] attributed to paleo-humans of the [[Aurignacian]] culture that are among the world’s oldest-known works of figurative art, include a figure of a horse.

The equine image was common in ancient Egyptian and Grecian art, more refined images displaying greater knowledge of equine anatomy appeared in [[Classical Greece]] and in later Roman work.

Horse-drawn chariots were commonly depicted in ancient works, for example on the [[Standard of Ur]] circa 2500BC. The [[Horses of Saint Mark]] are the sole surviving example from [[Classical Antiquity]] of a monumental statue of the [[Quadriga]].

The horse was less prevalent in early Christian and Byzantine art, overwhelmed by the dominance of religious themes.

===Renaissance and after===
The [[Renaissance]] period starting in the 14th century brought a resurgence of the horse in art. Painters of this period who portrayed the horse included [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea Mantegna]] and [[Titian]]. In 1482 the [[Duke of Milan]] [[Ludovico Sforza|Ludovico il Moro]], commissioned [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to create the largest equestrian statue in the world, a monument to the duke's father [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco]], however ''[[Leonardo's horse]]'' was never completed, (until it was replicated in the late 20th century).

In the [[Baroque]] era the tradition of equine portraiture was established, with artists such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Diego Velázquez]] portraying regal subjects atop their mounts. Equine sporting art also became established in this era as the tradition of horse racing emerged under Tudor patronage.&lt;ref name= "Oelke"/&gt;

===C18 and C19===
[[File:Eugene Delacroix - Horse Frightened by Lightning - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''Horse Frightened by Lightning'', 1825-29, watercolour, lead white on paper, 23.6 x 32 cm, [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest]]]]

[[Image:Rosa bonheur horse fair 1835 55.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Rosa Bonheur]], ''[[The Horse Fair]],'' 1853–1855, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

[[George Stubbs]] born in 1724 became so associated with his equestrian subjects that he was known as "the horse painter". A childhood interest in anatomy was applied to the horse he spent eighteen months dissecting equine carcasses and had an engraver produce book plates of his studies. These anatomical drawings aided later artists.

The mid 18th century saw the emergence of [[Romanticism]], French artists [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]] were proponents of this movement and both portrayed the horse in many of their works.

Equine sporting art was popular in the 19th century, notable artists of the period being [[Benjamin Marshall]], [[James Ward (artist)|James Ward]], [[Henry Thomas Alken]], [[James Pollard]], [[John Frederick Herring Sr.]] and [[Heywood Hardy]].  Horse racing gradually became more established in France and [[Impressionist]] painter [[Edgar Degas]] painted many early racing scenes. Degas was one of the first horse painters to use photographic references.&lt;ref name= "Oelke"/&gt; [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s photographic studies of animal motion had a huge influence on equine art as they allowed artists greater understanding of the horses gaits.

[[Rosa Bonheur]] became famous primarily for two chief works: ''Ploughing in the Nivernais'' (in French: ''Le labourage nivernais, le sombrage''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galerie.roi-president.com/photo-36-62-musee+d+orsay++consacre+a+l+art+de+1848+a+1914.html Galerie.roi-president.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and, ''The Horse Fair'' (in French: ''Le marché aux chevaux'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/435702 Metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (which was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1853 (finished in 1855) and is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], in [[New York City]]. Bonheur is widely considered to have been the most famous female painter of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, H. W., Janson, Anthony F. ''History of Art''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers. 6th edition.  {{ISBN|0-13-182895-9}}, page 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isidore Bonheur]], the younger brother of Rosa Bonheur, is known as one of the 19th century's most distinguished [[France|French]] [[animalier]] [[sculptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Christie's"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/isidore-jules-bonheur-the-steeplechase-4194354-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4194354&amp;sid=a339c2b1-09f5-40ec-b5a2-a4232e433766 Christie's New York, Isidore-Jules Bonheur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2007/the-sporting-sale-including-the-john-poynton-collection-l07121/lot.307.html Isidore-Jules Bonheur, ''Le Grand Jockey'' (''A Horse and Jockey''), bronze, Sotheby's London, 6 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He modeled his sculptures to catch movement or posture characteristic of the particular species. Isidore Bonheur achieved this most successfully with his sculptures of horses, usually depicted as relaxed rather than spirited, and which are among his most renowned works.&lt;ref name="Joconde"&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_98=AUTR&amp;VALUE_98=BONHEUR%20Isidore%20Jules&amp;NUMBER=1&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28BONHEUR%20Isidore%20Jules%29%20%3aAUTR%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=3&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=1&amp;MAX3=100&amp;DOM=All Joconde, Le Ministère de la culture, Portail des collections des musées de France, Bonheur Isidore Jules]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Alfred Munnings]] was an acclaimed painter working in England during the 20th century, he was elected president of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1944. He specialised in equine subjects, including horse racing, portraiture and studies of gypsies and rural life.

==Subject genres==

===Military and war===
[[File:The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]], Detail from ''The Procession of the [[Trojan Horse]] in Troy,'' (1773), inspired by Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Uccello Battle of San Romano Uffizi.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Uccello]], ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'', c. 1438–1440. Egg tempera with walnut oil and linseed oil on poplar. 181.6 x 320 cm. [[Uffizi]].]]
[[Military art]] often depicts the [[Horses in warfare|horse in battle]] and provides some of the earliest examples of the horse in art, with [[cavalry]], horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and [[horse archers]] all appearing on ancient artifacts.

In the medieval period cavalry battles and [[knight]]s on horseback were portrayed by artists including [[Paolo Uccello]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Uccello's tryptic [[The Battle of San Romano]] shows various stages of a battle. Dürer's engraving of  "Knight, Death and the Devil", 1513 shows a military subject combined with allegorical theme.

[[Sir Alfred Munnings]] was appointed as a [[war artist]] during World War I, he painted both the Canadian Cavalry Brigade and the Canadian Forestry Corps stationed in France. He considered his experiences with the Canadian units to have been among the most rewarding events of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Elizabeth Thompson]], known as Lady Butler, was famed for her military art, especially "Scotland Forever" featuring a dramatic charge by the [[Royal Scots Greys]].


===Horse racing===

[[File:Edgar Degas - Before the Race - Walters 37850.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Edgar Degas]], ''[[Before the Race (painting)|Before the Race]]'', 1882–84, oil on panel, [[The Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore]]
[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], Animated sequence of a race horse galloping, using photos published in 1887 (Animal Locomotion).]]
Thoroughbred racing was an inspiration for Romantic and Impressionist artists of the 19th century. [[Théodore Géricault]] painted [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 1821 during his stay in England. The Impressionist era coincided with the development of racing in France, [[Manet]], [[Degas]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] all acquired a lasting fascination with racing. Manet showing the excitement and action of the race and Degas concentrating more on the moments before the start. Degas was intensely interested in [[Eadweard Muybridge|Muybridge]]'s photographs of the horse in motion, he copied them in chalk and pencil and used them for reference in his later work.&lt;ref name= "Fairley"&gt;{{cite book 
|editor=

Generations of artists before Muybridge had portrayed the horse in a 'rocking horse' gallop with the horse portrayed with both front legs extended forward and both hind legs extended rearwards. Much more realistic representations were possible after the event of photography and Muybridge's work but that did not necessarily lead to the impression of movement in the artwork. [[Lowes Dalbiac Luard|Luard]] writing in 1921 compares the running action of an animal with the run and rhythm of an air in music, but the instantaneous moment recorded by a photograph as a detached chord with little meaning or context.&lt;ref name= "Luard"&gt;{{cite book

[[George Stubbs]] and [[Alfred Munnings]] have both left a vast body of work involving the racehorse.

In the 20th century, much of the artwork by [[John Skeaping]] involved the racing scene, including life-size bronzes of [[Hyperion (horse)|Hyperion]] and [[Brigadier Gerard (horse)|Brigadier Gerard]] and watercolours of race course action.

===The American West===

[[File:Charles Marion Russell - Buccaroos (1902).jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Charles Marion Russell]], ''Buccaroos,'' 1902]]
Artwork associated with the historic [[cowboy]] or [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] tradition of the American west naturally includes many equine subjects. [[:Category:Artists of the American West|Artists of the American West]] include [[Frederic Remington]] and [[C.M. Russell]] who are known for their paintings of equine subjects. Remington was one of the first American artists to illustrate the true gait of the horse in motion (along with [[Thomas Eakins]]), as validated by the famous sequential photographs of [[Eadweard Muybridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Peggy &amp; Harold Samuels, ''Frederic Remington: A Biography'', Doubleday &amp; Co., Garden City NY, {{ISBN|0-385-14738-4}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
Remington also captured equine drama in his bronze sculptures, his first, [[Bronco Buster]] ([[Williams College Museum of Art]]), was a critical and commercial success.

Inspired by El Greco's, ''Saint Martin and the Beggar'', c. 1597–1600, [[Art Institute of Chicago]] Pablo Picasso introduced horses into his work in 1905-06 notably ''[[Boy Leading a Horse]]'', [[Museum of Modern Art]]. [[Franz Marc]] and others including [[Susan Rothenberg]] and [[Deborah Butterfield]] beginning in the 1970s used horses as motifs in their paintings and sculpture throughout the 20th century. For a large and complex 20th century war painting in which a horse is the central dramatic figure, see [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] by [[Pablo Picasso]]. While [[Impressionist]] painter [[Edgar Degas]] was particularly famous for his paintings of dancers, Degas was also known for his paintings of horses and horse racing.

===Hunting===
Hunting scenes have been a common subject matter for equestrian painters. Specialists in [[fox hunting]] subjects include [[Cecil Aldin]] and [[Lionel Edwards]].

===Rural/working life===
[[Lucy Kemp-Welch]] was well known for her depiction of wild and working horses in the landscape.

It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the ''de facto'' alternative to fengshui.

''Huǒhēiàn'' translate as "fire and darkness" in English. This name refers to a passage from the ''[[Book of Burial]]'' of [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]:&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.trinity.edu/sfield/Fengshui/Zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike fengshui, ''huǒhēiàn'' values [[diagonal]] and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and [[Chinese jade|jade]] statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art).

Early practitioners of the aethetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations.  However, like the dark [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s of [[Gothic architecture]] (believed by some to be a Western [[analogy]] of sorts), ''huǒhēiàn'' grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in [[Chinese history]]. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]].

The art of ''huǒhēiàn'' countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house.  Additionally, ''huǒhēiàn'' enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical [[Chinese rock garden]].

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Art Critics''' (''Association Internationale des Critiques d’Art'', ''AICA'') was founded in 1950 to revitalize critical discourse, which suffered under [[Fascism]] during [[World War II]]. Affiliated with [[UNESCO]] AICA was admitted to the rank of [[non-governmental organization]] in 1951.

The main [[goal|objectives]] of AICA are:
* to promote the critical disciplines in the field of [[visual art]]s

{{Main|Jealousy}}

[[File:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Love Letter from a Rival'''&lt;br&gt; A youth catches her boyfriend with a love letter from another.&lt;br&gt;
[[Miyagawa Isshô]], ca. 1750; Panel from a series of ten [[homosexuality|homoerotic]] scenes, on a [[Shunga (art)|shunga]]-style painted hand scroll (kakemono-e); sumi, color and gofun on silk. Private collection.]]
'''Jealousy in art''' deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works.

Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss, real or imagined, of something or someone you believe is yours, whereas envy concerns what you don’t have and would like to possess. Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona: Iago is consumed with envy of Othello’s prestige. Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy, and because the emotion is so corrosive, jealousy is a common theme in literature and art, not to mention opera and cinema.

==Literature==
Literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications. Most famously, perhaps, Schahriar's destructive jealousy in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is what precipitates Scheherazade’s creative outpouring of stories. In [[Ariosto]]’s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness. [[Shakespeare]]'s later play, ''the Winters tale'' (1613) is predominately about the jealousy felt by Leontes' and his supposed adulterous wife. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]’s Princess Brambilla (1821) is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater, between reality and masks. In [[Charlotte Brontë]]’s ''Villette'' (1853) jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations, a potent denial of sexual stereotypes, and, like many novels written by women, an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover. [[Anthony Trollope]] uses both ''He Knew He Was Right'' (1869) and ''Kept in the Dark'' (1882) to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body. [[Tolstoy]]’s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'' (1889) offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed [[homosexuality]]. [[Proust]]’s ''In Search of Lost Time'' (1913–1927), especially the section concerning Albertine, represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment, illness and death, while [[Michal Choromanski]]’s ''Jealousy and Medicine'' (1932) creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy. [[Freud]]’s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires [[Iris Murdoch]]’s ''A Word Child'' (1975) in which the [[London]] subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same.

Other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader, as well as that between fiction and reality. [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]’s ''Jealousy'' (1965) develops the image of the window blind (in [[French language|French]] “la jalousie” means both the emotion and the window blind) to lock the reader into the jealous person’s mind, while in [[Julian Barnes]]’s ''Talking it Over'' (1991), the writer’s jealousy of the reader’s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines. [[A. S. Byatt]]’s ''Possession'' (1990) is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices.

==Graphic arts==
[[File:On the Beach -- Two Are Company, Three Are None.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Two are Company, Three Are None'', 1872, a [[wood engraving]] by [[Winslow Homer]]]]
In art, depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise: see for instance drawings by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690) or [[Sébastien Leclerc (1676-1763)|Sébastien Leclerc]] (the Younger) (1676–1763), or in a fuller treatment, the howling figure on the left in [[Bronzino]]’s ''An Allegory with Venus and Cupid'' (probably 1540-50). [[Albrecht Dürer]]’s 1498 drawing, ''Hercules’s Jealousy'' depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword. The theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]’s ''Paolo and Francesca'' (1819) which reveals the jealous husband’s gaze catching the young lovers’ first kiss. [[Edvard Munch]]’s many depictions of jealousy, however, tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze. This suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors. There are, nevertheless, lighter moments, as when [[Gaston de La Touche]] (1854–1913), in ''Jealousy or the Monkey'' shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman’s dress. While popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid, it remains a source, both in literature and in painting, of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself.

'''Lath art''' is a form of [[woodworking]] [[folk art]] for making rustic pictures out of strips out of old "[[lath]]" from "[[plaster]] and lath" walls. Today it is commonly made from lattice, lumber stickers and [[weathering|weathered]] [[lobster trap]]s. Beach scenes and rural scenes are the most popular themes. 

==Techniques==
  
Lath art has a lot in common with [[marquetry]] and [[intarsia]]. They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of wood, but marquetry  and intarsia use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the [[lath]] stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.

This is a list of [[Royal Doulton]] [[Bunnykins]] figurines.  Doulton &amp; Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by [[Charles Noke]] based on illustrations by [[Mary Barbara Bailey|Sister Mary Barbara Bailey]].  Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton &amp; Co. discontinued their manufacture.  After Royal Doulton purchased the [[Beswick Pottery]] factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines.&lt;ref name=Irvine1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Louise|title=Royal Doulton Bunnykins Figures|date=1991|publisher=UK International Ceramics|location=England|isbn=0951777254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia.  The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued.

Domestic [[U.S. Air Mail]] was established as a new class of mail service by the [[United States]] [[Post Office Department]] (POD) on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington&amp;ndash;Philadelphia&amp;ndash;New York route. Special [[postage stamps]] were issued for use with this service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400048427 The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Postage Stamps 2005], 27th Edition (Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps) by Thomas E. Jr Hudgeons (Author) Publisher: House of Collectibles; 27 edition (June 8, 2004)  {{ISBN|978-1-4000-4842-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic air mail became obsolete in 1975, and international air mail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junior-philatelists.com/USStampsHistoryAirM1.htm |title=United States Postage stamps: 1847 through 1947 ~ The first 100 years |publisher=Junior Philatelists |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995, when the USPS began transporting First Class mail by air on a routine basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usstamps.coinsandstamps.com/Airmails/airmailsc1c15.htm |title=AIRMAILS C1-C15 |publisher=Usstamps.coinsandstamps.com |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621221556/http://usstamps.coinsandstamps.com/Airmails/airmailsc1c15.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stampandcoin.com/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?client=96060179&amp;action=serve&amp;item=airmail.htm |title=U.S. Airmail Stamp Color Catalog |publisher=Stampandcoin.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; All post-1977 United States stamp images are copyright of [[USPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Usams-nostamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott catalog]]ed stamps received a "C" designation for airmail issues beginning in 1940.  Designated for international mail, and showing a small airplane, the January, 2012 $1.05 Scenic America series issue was designated C150.  However, with the January, 2013 issue of the $1.10 Global [[Forever Stamp]] no specific airmail purpose was shown in the design.  Rather, the Postal Service stated that this "stamp offers a single price for any First-Class Mail International 1-ounce letter to any country in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=S_578804&amp;categoryId=subcatS_S_Sheets Global Forever]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a regular series Scott number, 4740, was designated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40700">The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) owns a number of significant artworks in its venue at [[Burlington House]] in London. The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society.

==Humphry Davy bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 14 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Humphry Davy bust – Burlington House]]
Located along the corridor on the first floor of Burlington House, the bronze bust of Sir [[Humphry Davy]] was created by Ruby Levick and is a reproduction of an earlier sculpture by Miss Moore, donated to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messell&lt;ref name=Messel&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolph Messel|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/m2/rudolph_messel.html|website=Theodora}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolph Messel|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/37/101037761/|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1900. At the Annual General Meeting of the Chemical Society of 29 March, Sir [[Thomas Edward Thorpe]] (President of the Society), reported on the gift of this work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1900|volume=77|page=561|doi=10.1039/ct9007700555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=David|title=The Historical Collection at the Chemistry Centre|date=2010|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=London|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We are indebted to several of our Fellows for additions to the artistic possessions of the Society. [[Heinrich Debus (chemist)|Dr. Debus]] has presented us with a striking bust of Sir Humphry Davy, a cast of one modelled during his lifetime by Miss Moore. In accordance with the donor’s wishes, this bust now appears in our Meeting Room. On the recommendation of [[Thomas Armstrong (painter)|Mr. Thomas Armstrong]], C.B., formerly the Art Director of the Science and Art Department, who was much impressed with the artistic quality of Miss Moore’s work, this bust has been copied by Miss Levick, with certain adaptations taken from Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]]’s well-known portrait in the possession of the [[Royal Society]], and has been reproduced in bronze. The reproduction, together with its pedestal, has been given by our colleague, Dr. Messel.}}

Sir Humphry Davy is best remembered today for his discoveries of several alkali and alkaline earth metals, as well as contributions to the discoveries of the elemental nature of chlorine and iodine.

[[Ruby Levick]] was a Welsh sculptor and medallist who had many of her works exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name=Mapping&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Ruby Levick|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1203032618|website=Mapping the Practise and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland, 1851–1951|publisher=University of Glasgow, History of Art and HATII, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=T.

==John Dalton bust ==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 15 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|John Dalton bust – Burlington House]]
The bronze bust of [[John Dalton]], located along the corridor on the first floor, was also created by Ruby Levick and was donated to the [[Chemical Society]] in 1903 by its former President Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe,&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt; as also attested by the inscription engraved on the bust's base: "John Dalton presented by T.E. Thorpe CB. L.L.D. F.R.S. past President in commemoration of the centenary of the enunciation of the atomic theory".

A copy of his accompanying letter was printed in the ''[[Proceedings of the Chemical Society]]'' in 1903 and read out by President [[William A. Tilden]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|journal=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|date=1903|volume=19|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The bronze is the work of Miss Levick, who is already favourably known to the Society by her reproduction of the bust of Davy in their possession. Of the artistic merits of her present work others must be the judge, but I may be permitted here to express my indebtedness to her for the skill and conscientious care with which she has striven to make a faithful and adequate presentment of the grand old philosopher.}}

John Dalton was an English chemist best known for his development of [[atomic theory]].

==William Henry Perkin bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 11 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|William Henry Perkin bust – Burlington House]]
The marble bust on the first floor of Burlington House representing Sir [[William Henry Perkin]] was presented to the Chemical Society in 1907 by the committee administering the fund subscribed in support of the international celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Coal Tar Colour Industry. At the Annual General Meeting of the Society, President [[Raphael Meldola]] reported on this gift:&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|31}}

{{quote|On the occasion of the International Celebration marking the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Foundation of the Coal Tar Colour Industry, an address of congratulation to Sir William Henry Perkin, F.R.S., was presented on behalf of the Society by the President. In accordance with the resolution of the public meeting at which the commemoration was inaugurated, a marble bust of Sir William Perkin, executed by Mr. F. W. Pomeroy, A.K.A., has been presented to the Society by the Committee administering the Fund subscribed in support of the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1907|volume=91|page=618|doi=10.1039/ct9079100615}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perkin's fame is mainly related to his discovery of [[mauveine]].

The artist, [[Frederick William Pomeroy]], was a British sculptor mainly prolific in ideal work and portrait busts, but also creator of public monuments.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick William Pomeroy|url=http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=pomeroy_fw|website=Glasgow Sculpture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The portrait of the Honourable Robert Boyle, in the Library of the Institute, is attributed to [[Jonathan Richardson]], who left many portraits unsigned; this has been pronounced by several authorities as undoubtedly his work. The portrait bears the dates of Boyle’s birth and death (1626–1691) and was probably a posthumous portrait. Richardson was born in 1665; however, names and dates were often added to portraits long after they had been painted. The portrait resembles the engraving of a bust by Faber and bears a close likeness to Boyle’s sister, the Countess of Ranelagh, at whose house in London he lived and worked for many years. It has been objected that few of the nobility and gentlemen of the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]] were painted otherwise than in court dress. Portraits showing gentlemen in dressing gowns and velvet caps appeared more frequently about 1720, when Boyle had been dead nearly 30 years; but it may be suggested that Richardson preferred to represent him as a philosopher in his study. Towards the end of his life, Boyle lived very quietly in the country and did not frequent the court. The picture was purchased at a sale at [[Loudoun Castle]], Galston, Ayrshire, and acquired for the Institute, by private subscription, in 1931.}}

{{quote|The portrait of Prof. Meldola, referred to in the Report of the Council, was unveiled by Sir [[James Johnston Dobbie|James Dobbie]], President of the Institute, at a Special Meeting of the Council held on December 15th, 1917. Mrs. Meldola, Lady Dobbk, Prof. and Mrs. Poulton, and a number of friends and past students of Prof. Meldola were also present. The President said that Sir George Keilby had on the same afternoon unveiled another portrait of Prof. Meldola, by the same artist (Solomon J. Solomon), at the Royal Society. He referred to the late Professor’s interest in science generally as well as in that which he had chosen as his profession. It was fitting that such a memorial should find a place in the Council Room, especially in view of the valuable services rendered to the Institute by Prof. Meldola in connection with the new building during the last few years of his life. After alluding to the extraordinary range and varied character of Prof. Meldola’s activities in teaching, in research and in public affairs, he paid a tribute to his personal qualities as a man, remarking on his strong character and influence, his appreciation of humour, his fine literary gift and powers of conversation. Having unveiled the portrait the President warmly praised the work. All would agree that the artist had achieved a remarkable success. He also expressed the hearty thanks of the Institute to those who had subscribed to the presentation, and to Prof. Poulton for having been the means whereby the Institute had become possessed of such a valuable memorial to its past President. Prof. Poulton having replied, Mr. Gordon Salamon, Hon. Treasurer, also spoke in appreciation of the gift, and the President’s remarks were warmly endorsed by Mr. A. J. Chapman, a former student of Prof. Meldola.}}

'''Media imperialism''' is a theory based upon an over-[[Market concentration|concentration]] of [[mass media]] from larger nations as a significant variable in negatively affecting smaller nations, in which the national identity of smaller nations is lessened or lost due to media homogeneity inherent in mass media from the larger countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/22/4/415.abstract|title=Media imperialism revisited: some findings from the Asian case|author=Kalyani Chadha, Anandam Kavoori|publisher=Media Culture &amp; Society|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The media imperialism debate started in the early 1970s when developing countries began to criticise the control developed countries held over the media. The site for this conflict was [[UNESCO]] where the New World Information and Communication Order ([[NWICO]]) movement developed. Supported by the MacBride report, "[[MacBride report|Many Voices, One World]]", countries such as [[India]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Egypt]] argued that the large media companies should have limited access to developing countries. This argument was one of the reasons for the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Singapore]] leaving UNESCO.

In 1977, [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]]'s "[[Media Formation Model]]" framed media imperialism as the relationship between different national media systems, particularly through [[Balance of power (international relations)|power imbalances]], and the relationship they have to historical political systems. It emphasized the industrial arrangements of media in wealthier nations and the imposition of those arrangements as “models” for foreign markets, with the most powerful producers becoming normative in their financing, structure and in the dissemination (and to some extent, content) of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd-Barrett|first1=Oliver|title=Media imperialism: towards an international framework for the analysis of media systems|journal=Mass communication and society|date=1977|pages=116–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd asserted a typical arrangement in which news agencies, adopted the structures, roles and “task behaviors” of their parent companies who are also providing financial support.

Later during the 1980s and 1990s, as [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[media conglomerates]] grow larger and more powerful many believe that it will become increasingly difficult for small, local media outlets to survive. A new type of [[imperialism]] will thus occur, making many nations subsidiary to the media products of some of the most powerful countries or companies. Significant writers and thinkers in this area include [[Ben Bagdikian]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Edward S. Herman]], [[Armand Mattelart]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]]. However, critics have responded that in most developing countries the most popular television and radio programs are commonly locally produced. Critics such as [[Anthony Giddens]] highlight the place of regional producers of media (such as Brazil in Latin America); other critics such as [[James Curran (media historian)|James Curran]] suggest that State government subsidies have ensured strong local production. In areas such as audience studies, it has been shown that global programs like [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]] do not have a global audience who understand the program the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Liebes | first1=Tamar | first2=Elihu|last2=Katz|authorlink2=Elihu Katz|title=The export of meaning : cross-cultural readings of Dallas | publisher=Polity Press | publication-place=Cambridge | year=2004|edition=2| isbn=978-0-7456-1295-9 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A media source which ignores and/or censors important issues and events severely damages [[freedom of information]]. Many modern tabloid, twenty-four-hour news channels and other mainstream media sources have increasingly been criticized for not conforming to general standards of [[journalistic integrity]].

Media imperialism is not always an international occurrence. When a small number of companies or corporations controls all the media in a country, this too is a form of media imperialism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Nations such as Italy and Canada are often accused of possessing an imperial media structure, based on the fact that much of their media is controlled by a small number of owners.

==Canada==
{{main|Media of Canada}}
The media in Canada can be seen as imperial in the sense of [[Concentration of media ownership|concentrated ownership]]. Apart from a relatively small number of [[Community radio|community broadcasters]], media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of groups, including [[Bell Canada]], the Shaw family (via [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[Shaw Communications]]), [[Rogers Communications]], [[Quebecor Inc.|Quebecor]], and the government-owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/Radio-Canada]]. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of television, specialty television, and radio operations. Bell, Rogers, Shaw, and Quebecor also engage in the telecommunications industry with their ownership of internet providers, television providers, and mobile carriers, while Rogers is also involved in publishing.

==USA==
{{main|Media of the United States}}
The United States has proved to have quite a significant role in media imperialism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} For instance, many forms of mass media demonstrate how the United States exerts media power over other countries, especially those lacking in a strong media presence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} A major cultural influencer in other countries is television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osama|first=El-Sherif|date=August 20, 2001|title=Media imperialism in the global era|url=http://libproxy.boisestate.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/docview/203075150?accountid=9649|journal=Middle East News Online|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in relation to [[news]] and [[journalism]], America has a strong presence in the international arena. American news networks like [[CNN]] often have large international staffs, and produce specialized regional programming for many nations.

Movies have a distinctly American dominance. For example, [[Hollywood]] is a major producer of films, which tend to be high quality and are released internationally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914290275|title=Media essentials : a brief introduction|last=1949-|first=Campbell, Richard,|others=Martin, Christopher R.,, Fabos, Bettina,, Harmsen, Shawn.|isbn=9781457693762|edition=Third|location=Boston|oclc=914290275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's dominance is also seen in the term "[[Bollywood]]", describing India's [[Hindi]]-language film industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another form of mass media used for media imperialism is music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of today's, and older, American music finds itself popular in other countries. However, in the "[[British Invasion]]" of the 1960s, British music became popular in the United States. Since then, there has not been such a large shift of imperialism. Furthermore, some could argue{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}} that it wasn't that large of a shift of power, because it was still a dominance of Western influence.

Overall, American media imperialism can be seen as a positive and a negative. Negative views towards it stem from the negative connotation of the word 'imperialism'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899205069|title=Media imperialism|last=Oliver,|first=Boyd-Barrett,|isbn=9781446268704|location=London|oclc=899205069}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is associated with [[Imperialism|political imperialism]], in which a large country creates an empire out of smaller ones. However, media imperialism can be seen as a positive when it is viewed as a way to create a consensus narrative. A consensus narrative is a result of "products that provide us with shared experiences".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By having similar experiences, it opens the gateway for communication and development of relationships. Yet, this can also become a problem when the cultural exchange is not balanced or reciprocated. American culture is being transmitted to other countries, but other cultures may not be{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}} received in return.

Therefore, this creates an atmosphere of [[cultural imperialism]] where American culture is dominating others and becoming the main one. For example, "...numerous international observers contend that consumers in countries inundated by American-made movies, television, and images have even less control than American consumers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Attribution needed|reason=Who said this? this needs to be attributed to a specific person|date=December 2017}} Moreover, these forms of mass media channels are not the only ones that have an American feeling to them, the internet also has somewhat of an American appearance.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}}

Additionally, media imperialism, in the sense of concentrated ownership, has its own effects within the United States. Many news organizations are owned by a limited number of corporations. One such example is [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his companies' ownership of several notable media outlets, including [[21st Century Fox]] and the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other large media corporations consist of [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Comcast]]. In 2018, AT&amp;T and Time Warner merged, further concentrating media ownership in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/media/att-time-warner-ruling/index.html|title=Judge approves $85 billion AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal|last=Gold|first=Hadas|date=2018-06-13|work=CNN Media|access-date=2018-06-23|last2=Stelter|first2=Brian|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
{{main|Media of Italy}}
In Italy, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] operates Italy's top TV stations with the [[Mediaset]] empire, and the public broadcaster [[RAI]] has been subject to political influence.  Media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] has warned of formal political influence in stifling the media.
In April 2013 comedian [[Beppe Grillo]] accelerated the debate within Italy about the independence of media from political interests, releasing poll results showing that out of 95,000 responses 99 percent wanted a public broadcast channel free from political meddling, and 52 percent wanted more investigative journalism about domestic issues.  He wrote in a blog post,  'a part of the Italian population is living in a gigantic [[The Truman Show|Truman show]], and responsibility for this is entirely due to Italian journalists, with the usual few exceptions...RAI has to be reorganized and transformed into a public service following the model of the [[BBC]] without any connection to the parties...'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapolicy.org|date=April 4, 2013|title=Italy living in Gigantic Truman Show}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada (YORYM-2004.1.1957).JPG|thumb|Thrown, combed tea bowl by [[Shōji Hamada]]]]

{{nihongo|'''''Mingei'''''|民芸||"folk arts" or "arts of the people"}}, the [[Japan]]ese [[folk art]] movement, was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s in Japan. Its founding father was [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] (1889–1961).

==Origins==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of a curiosity for Korean crafts. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924, and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966). In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period]] that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum was established.

==Theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is "hand-crafted art of ordinary people" ({{nihongo|民衆的な工芸|minshū-teki-na kōgei}}). Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life
*representative of the regions in which they were produced.

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts, including [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

==Criticisms of Theory and Orientalism==
[[File:Thrown Bowl by Bernard Leach (YORYM-2004.1.166).JPG|thumb|Thrown bowl by [[Bernard Leach]]]]
In recent decades, scholars such as Yuko Kikuchi and Brian Moeran have claimed they have uncovered power relations and [[ultra-nationalism]] that lie at the core of the formation of ''mingei'' theory. In 1927, Yanagi put forward the "criterion of beauty in Japan" ({{lang|ja|日本における美の標準}} ''{{transl|ja|nihon ni okeru bi no hyōjun}}'') in ''The Way of Crafts'' ({{lang|ja|工芸の道}} ''{{transl|ja|kōgei no michi}}''). During the years of rising [[militarism]] in Japan, Sōetsu Yanagi extended his application of the "criterion of beauty" to the crafts of the [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the Japanese peripheries, and to those of the [[Japanese colonies|colonies]] including [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Manchuria]]. These scholars argue that ''mingei'' theory, far from being an [[Oriental]] theory, is a "hybridization" and "appropriation" of [[Europe|Occidental]] ideas such as that of [[William Morris]] (1834–1896)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Nakanishi.html Wendy Jones Nakanishi, "The Anxiety of Influence: Ambivalent Relations Between Japan's 'Mingei' and Britain's 'Arts and Crafts' Movements", Electronic Journal of Japanese Studies, 28 October 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) introduced when he lived and worked in Japan from 1909 to 1920.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Citation

Yūko Kikuchi terms this phenomenon "Oriental Orientalism".

Yanagi’s ''Korea and its Art'' was severely criticized by Korean intellectuals as a "colonialist view of history" in 1974. Yanagi defined "beauty of sadness" ({{lang|ja|悲哀の美}} ''{{transl|ja|hiai no bi}}'') as the "innate, original beauty created by the Korean race" ({{lang|ja|民族の固有の美}} ''{{transl|ja|minzoku no koyū no bi}}''). Yanagi believed that the long history of foreign invasions of Korea was reflected in Korean art, and especially in its [[pottery]], in the "sad and lonely" lines. Such a theory has been criticized by Korean scholars as the "aesthetic of [[colonialism]]".

'''Narrative structure''', a [[literary element]], is generally described as the structural framework that underlies the order and manner in which a [[narrative]] is presented to a reader, listener, or viewer. The narrative text structures are the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]].

== Definition ==
Narrative structure is about story and plot: the content of a story and the form used to tell the story. Story refers to the dramatic action as it might be described in chronological order. Plot refers to how the story is told. Story is about trying to determine the key conflicts, main characters, setting and events. Plot is about how, and at what stages, the key conflicts are set up and resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecinematheque.ca/education/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LanguageofFilm01.pdf ''Visual Storytelling and Narrative Structure'', In Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description == 
The setup (act one) is where all of the main characters and their basic situations are introduced, and contains the primary level of characterization (exploring the character's backgrounds and personalities). A [[problem]] is also introduced, which is what drives the story forward.

The second act, the conflict, is the bulk of the story, and begins when the inciting incident (or [[catalyst]]) sets things into motion. This is the part of the story where the characters go through major changes in their lives as a result of what is happening; this can be referred to as the [[character arc]], or character development.

The third act, or [[plot (narrative)#Resolution|resolution]], is when the problem in the story boils over, forcing the characters to confront it, allowing all the elements of the story to come together and inevitably leading to the ending.

== History ==
First described in ancient times by [[Greek philosophers]] (such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]), the notion of narrative structure saw renewed popularity as a critical concept in the mid-to-late-20th century, when structuralist literary theorists including [[Roland Barthes]], [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Joseph Campbell]], and [[Northrop Frye]] attempted to argue that all human narratives have certain universal, deep structural elements in common. This argument fell out of fashion when advocates of [[poststructuralism]] such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] asserted that such universally shared, deep structures were logically impossible.

In Frye's ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', he deals extensively with what he calls myths of [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Fall]], and [[Winter]]:

* Spring myths are [[comedy|comedies]], that is, stories that lead from bad situations to happy endings.  [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' is such a story.
* Summer myths are similarly [[utopia]]n [[fantasy|fantasies]] such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.
* Fall myths are [[tragedies]] that lead from ideal situations to disaster. Compare ''[[Hamlet]], [[Othello]]'', and ''[[King Lear]]'' and the movie ''[[Legends of the Fall]]''.
* Winter myths are [[dystopia]]s; for example, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', and [[Ayn Rand]]'s novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]''.

== Categories ==
Most forms of narrative fall under four main categories: linear narratives, nonlinear narrative, interactive narration, and interactive narrative. 
*[[Linear narrative]] is the most common form of narration, where events are largely portrayed in a chronological order, that is, telling the events in the order in which they occurred.
*[[Nonlinear narrative]]s, disjointed narrative or disrupted narrative is a narrative technique, where events are portrayed, out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern.
*[[Interactive narration]] refers to works where the linear narrative is driven by, rather than influenced by, the users interaction.
*[[Interactive narrative]] is a form of fiction in which users are able to make ''choices'' that influence the narrative (for example, through alternative plots or resulting in alternative endings) through their actions.

=== Linear narrative ===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] are often confused with true narratives which are not linear, but the concept is fundamentally linear. An example would be ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' by [[Orson Welles]]. Although some films appear to open (very briefly) with the ending, flashback movies almost immediately jump back to the very beginning of the story to proceed linearly from there, and usually proceed past the supposed "ending" shown at the beginning of the movie.

=== Nonlinear narrative ===
Cinema can only provide the illusion through broken narrative, a famous example of this being the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. The film is ostensibly three short stories, which, upon closer inspection, are actually three sections of one story with the [[chronology]] broken up; [[Quentin Tarantino]] constructs the narrative without resorting to classic "flashback" techniques.

An even more ambitious attempt at constructing a film based on non-linear narrative is [[Alain Resnais]]'s 1993 French film ''[[Smoking/No Smoking]]''. The plot contains parallel developments, playing on the idea of what might have happened had the characters made different choices.

=== Interactive narration ===
In works of interactive narration there is only one narrative but the method of delivery requires the user to actively work to gain the next piece of the narrative, or have to piece the parts of narrative that they have together in order to form a coherent narrative.

This is the narrative approach of some modern video games. A player will be required to reach an objective, complete a task, solve a puzzle, or finish a level before the narrative continues.

=== Interactive narrative ===
An [[interactive narrative]] is one which is composed with a branching structure where a single starting point may lead to multiple developments and outcomes. The principle of all such games is that, at each step of the narrative, the user makes choices that advance the story, leading to new series of choices. Authoring non-linear narrative or dialogue thus implies imagining an indefinite number of parallel stories.

In a [[gamebook]], readers are told to turn to a certain page according to the choice they wish to make to continue the story. Typically, the choice will be an action rather than dialogue. For example, the hero hears a noise in another room and must decide to open the door and investigate, run away, or call for help. This kind of interactive experience of a story is possible with video games and books (where the reader is free to turn the pages) but less adapted to other forms of entertainment. Improvisational theatre is similarly open-ended, but of course cannot be said to be authored.

== Graphic narrative ==
A simple Graphic Narrative has four stages: an introduction of the characters and a description of a situation, the introduction of a problem, unexpected opportunity, or other complication into the situation, a resolution in the form of a partial or complete response to the problem by one or more of the characters, and the denouement, the aftermath of the response that makes clear the success, partial success, non-success, or uncertain success of the response. This fourth stage may also show how the original situation has changed due to what has taken place in the Complication and Resolution stages of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Baraou, Anne. "Facing Faces", ''Drawn and Quarterly'' 10 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a simple narrative, the four stages appear in order. That is, the sequence of the telling or presentation follows the chronology of the told. In a more complex story, the order of the telling may vary. For instance, such a story may begin with the Denouement and then present the Situation, Complication, and Resolution in a flashback. But this is not the case with a simple narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jbass/courses/402/402_spr10_sns.htm "Composing Graphic Narratives", Rutgers University]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23608">The '''Neo-Concrete Movement''' (1959–61) was a Brazilian art movement, which developed from [[Rio de Janeiro]]’s [[Grupo Frente]], a coalition of artists working in [[Concrete Art]]. Neoconcrete artists rejected the pure rationalist approach of concrete art and embraced a more phenomenological and less scientific art. [[Ferreira Gullar]] inspired Neo-Concrete philosophy through his essay “Theory of the Non-Object” (1959) and wrote the “Neo-Concrete Manifesto” (1959) which outlines what Neo-Concrete art should be. [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]], and [[Lygia Pape]] were among the primary leaders of this movement.

== Background ==
After [[World War One]], Europe witnessed a boom of art movements based upon rationalism such as [[De Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]]. Artists believed humanity would be able to achieve progress through its ability to reason. In Latin America, ideas of rationalist and non-objective art took root in the early 1950s in reaction to the muralism controversy.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Latin American Art of the 20th Century|date=2004|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20356-9|pages=121, 137|oclc=57007345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments such as the Mexican government utilized muralists to create propaganda. Under repressive Latin American governments, artists rebelled against the idea of aiding the political regime through figurative art; therefore geometric abstraction and concretism ushered in an art that did not connote anything political or have really any meaning at all.

[[Concrete Art]] was able to flourish beneath these repressive regimes because it held no political messages or incendiary material.&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; In Brazil, ideas of rationalist art and geometric abstraction arose in the early 1950s following the establishment of a democratic republic in 1946.  The period from 1946 to 1964 is known as the [[Second Brazilian Republic]].&lt;ref name ="Flynn"&gt;Flynn, Peter. Flynn, Peter. ''Nations of the Modern World, Brazil: A Political Analysis''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as Grupo Ruptura in [[Sao Paulo]] and Grupo Frente in Rio de Janeiro rose. Specifically Ruptura followed the ideal of pure [[mathematical art]] which does not connote meaning outside of what it is.&lt;ref name ="Balderston"&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures''. Ed. Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez, and Ana M. Lopez. London: Routledge, 2002. 1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Concrete art movement arose when Grupo Frente realized that Concretism was “naïve and somewhat colonialist” and an “overly rational conception of abstract structure.”&lt;ref name ="Brett"&gt;Brett, Guy. "Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica." ''Latin American Artists of the Nineteenth Century.'' New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1993. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 as the political tides began to turn, the Neo-Concrete artists disbanded no longer content to limit themselves to this one philosophy. [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Hélio Oiticica]], leaders of the Neo-Concrete movement, put their energy into Conceptual Art. Art historians often refer to Neo-Concretism as the precursor to Conceptual Art because of the foundation of “abstruse metaphysics.”&lt;ref name=LatinAmericanArt20thCentury-2004 /&gt; On April 1, 1964, a military coup removed [[Joao Goulart]] and established a military government in Brazil until 1985.&lt;ref name="Flynn"/&gt; The increase of violence called for a new kind of art that had the potential to carry meaning and deconstruct traditional thought even further. This came in the form of [[Conceptual Art]].

== The Neo-Concrete Manifesto and the push against Concretism ==
Brazilian poet and writer [[Ferreira Gullar]] wrote the Neo-Concrete Manifesto in 1959 and described a work of art as “something which amounts to more than the sum of its constituent elements; something which analysis may break down into various elements but which can only be understood phenomenologically.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"&gt;Gullar, Ferreira. “Neo-Concrete Manifesto.” ''History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader.'' Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Concrete Art movement, Gullar was calling for an art that was not based upon rationalism or in pursuit of pure form. He sought works of art that became active once the viewer was involved. Neo-concrete art must disassemble the limitations of the object and “express complex human realities.”&lt;ref name ="Gullar"/&gt;

While Concretism built its art upon the basis of logic and objective knowledge with color, space, and form conveying universalism and objectivity, the Neo-Concrete artists saw colors, space, and form as “not [belonging] to this or that artistic language, but to the living and indeterminate experience of man.”&lt;ref name ="Amor"&gt;Amor, Monica. “From Work to Frame, In Between, and Beyond: Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, 1959–1964.” ''Grey Room'' 38 (Winter 2010): 20-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neo-Concrete Art still maintained Concretism as the foundation for their ideas, Neo-Concretists believed objectivity and mathematical principles alone could not accomplish the Concretist goal of creating a transcendental visual language.

Neo-Concretists believed that artworks were not simply static representations or forms; rather “art should be like living organisms” &lt;ref name ="Brett"/&gt; In Lygia Clark’s theoretical statement written to address the intentions of the Neo-Concrete artists, she explains that as artists they wish to “found a new, expressive ‘space’.”&lt;ref name ="Bois"&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. “Nostalgia of the Body.” ''The MIT Press 69'' (Summer 1994): 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement believed that through a direct relationship between the artwork and the viewer this “new, expressive ‘space’” could be constructed.&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt; Neo-Concrete artists sought to create a multi-sensorial space which caused the spectator to feel more acutely their own body and existence.

Clark also wrote of how Neo-Concretism sought to decipher the nature of humanity by creating a “medium of expression” which allowed people to “become aware of unity as an organic, living whole.”&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark, Lygia. “1960: Death of the Plane.” ‘’October’’ 69 (Summer 1994): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not just restoring an awareness of the spectator’s body but also of humanity’s communal existence.

The first Neo-Concrete Exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro in March 1959, and the exhibiting artists were [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo_Jardim]], and [[Theon Spanudis]].&lt;ref name ="Bois"/&gt;

== ''Neo-Concrete Manifesto'' ==
This manifesto was written by [[Ferreira Gullar]], and was signed by [[Amilcar de Castro]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], [[Franz Weissmann]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Reynaldo Jardim]] and [[Theon Spanudis]]. It was published on 22 of March 1959 in ''Journal do Brazil.''

We use the term “neo-concrete” to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative “[[geometric art|geometric]]” art ([[neo-plasticism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm School]]) and in particular the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously extreme rationalism. Compelled by their experiences, the painters, sculptors, engravers, and writers participating in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to revise the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains.

Born with [[cubism]], as a reaction against the impressionist disintegration of poetic language, it was natural that so-called geometric art should situate itself in a position diametrically opposed to the technical and allusive resources of ordinary painting. The new achievements of physics and mechanics, in opening up a wide perspective for objective thought, encouraged, among those who continued this revolution, the tendency towards an everincreasing rationalization of the processes and purposes of painting. A mechanicalist notion of construction invaded the language of painters and sculptors, generating, in turn, equally extreme responses of a reactionary nature, such as [[magic realism|magical]] or irrationalist [[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Dada art|Dada]], or [[surrealism]]. Therefore, there is no doubt that the true artists—as is the case with, for example, [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]]—constructed their works following those theories that consecrated [[scientific objectivity]] and mechanical precision, but in that hand-to-hand combat with expression they overcame the limits imposed by theory. Yet the work of those artists has been interpreted to this day from theoretical positions that that same work denied. We propose a reinterpretation of neo-plasticism, constructivism, and other similar movements, basing ourselves on their expressive successes and making the work of art take precedence over theory. If we were to attempt to understand Mondrian’s painting starting from his theories, we would be forced to choose one over the other. We either find the prophecy of the complete integration of art in daily life to be possible (and we see in Mondrian’s work the first steps in that direction), or we view that integration as ever more remote, in which case his work seems to have failed. Either the vertical and the horizontal are truly the fundamental rhythms of the universe, and Mondrian’s oeuvre is the application of that universal principle, or the principle fails, and his work turns out to be based on an illusion. But the truth is that Mondrian’s work is there, alive and fertile, above these theoretical contradictions. It is useless to view Mondrian as the destroyer of the surface, of the plane and the line, if we do not perceive the new space that that destruction constructed.

The same can be said of [[Georges Vantongerloo|Vantongerloo]] or Pevsner. It does not matter what mathematical equations are at the root of a sculpture or a painting by Vantongerloo, because only in the experience of its direct perception does the work provide the “meaning” of its rhythms and colors. Whether Pevsner started from figures of descriptive geometry or not is irrelevant, when one confronts the new space that his sculptures generate and the cosmic-organic expression that, through it, its forms reveal. Determining the ways in which artistic objects and scientific instruments, or the artist’s intuition and the physicist’s and engineer’s objective thought, converged may be interesting from a cultural standpoint, but from an aesthetic standpoint, the work of art provokes interest precisely because of what it possesses that transcends these external circumstances—because of the universe of existential meanings that merge and are revealed in the work of art.

[[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], having recognized the superiority of “pure perception in art,” placed his theoretical definitions in a position that was safe from the limitations of rationalism and mechanicalism, projecting a transcendent dimension in his paintings that guarantees him a notable relevance today. But Malevich’s daring cost him dearly, in simultaneously opposing both figurative art and mechanicalist abstraction, for to this day certain rationalist theoreticians consider him a naïf who did not understand the true sense of the new plastic arts … In fact, Malevich already expressed, within “geometric” painting, his dissatisfaction, his desire to transcend the rational and the sensorial, which today is undeniably manifest.

Neo-concretism, emerging out of the need to express the complex reality of modern man with the structural language of the new plastic arts, denies the validity of the attitudes espoused by scientificism and positivism in art and reconsiders the problem of expression, incorporating the new “verbal” dimensions created by constructive, non-figurative art. Rationalism divests art of all autonomy and substitutes the untransferable qualities of the work of art with notions of scientific objectivity. Thus, the concepts of form, space, time, and structure—which in the arts are linked to an existential meaning, emotive and affective—are confused with their theoretical application by science. In fact, in the name of preconceived ideas that today’s philosophy denounces ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|M. Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ernst Cassirer|E. Cassirer]], [[Susanne Katherina Langer|S. Langer]])—and that are collapsing in every field, starting with modern biology, which has overcome Pavlovian mechanicalism—the concretist-rationalists still view man as a machine among machines and attempt to limit art to the expression of that theoretical reality.

We do not conceive of art either as a “machine” or as an “object” but as a quasi-corpus, that is, an entity whose reality is not exhausted in the external relationships
of its elements; an entity that, though analytically divisible into its parts, only gives itself up fully to a direct, phenomenological approach. We believe that the work of art overcomes the material mechanism upon which it rests, not due to some virtue lying outside this Earth: it overcomes it by transcending those mechanical relationships (which is the object of Gestalt theory) and by creating for itself a tacit signification (Merleau-Ponty) that emerges in it for the first time. If we had to search for a simile for the work of art, we could not find it, therefore, either in a machine or in objects taken objectively, but rather, as S. Langer and [[Vladimir Weidlé|V. Wleidlé]] [sic] argue, in living organisms. Furthermore, this comparison would not be sufficient to express the specific reality of the aesthetic organism.

Since the work of art is not limited to occupying a place in objective space—but rather transcends it in basing a new signification in it—the objective notions of time, space, form, structure, color, etc. are not sufficient to understand the work of art, to fully explain its “reality.” The lack of an adequate terminology for expressing a world that does not succumb to notions led art critics indiscriminately to employ words that are unfaithful to the complexity of the created work. The influence of technology and science was manifest here as well, to the degree that today, with their roles reversed, certain artists, confused by that terminology, attempt to make art starting from these objective notions in order to apply them as a creative method. Inevitably, the artists who work in this fashion only reveal a priori notions, since they are constrained by a method that already prescribes the results of their work before they begin. By avoiding intuitive creation, by reducing himself to an objective body in an objective space, with his paintings the rationalist concrete artist hardly demands, from himself and from the viewer, a stimulating and reflexive reaction. He speaks to the eye as an instrument and not to the eye as a human means of possessing the world and of giving oneself to it; he speaks to the machine-eye and not the body-eye.

Given that the work of art transcends mechanical space, the notions of cause and effect lose all validity in it, and the notions of time, space, form, and color are integrated
in such a way—since they lacked any existence, as those notions, prior to the work—that it would be impossible to speak of them as elements that can be broken down. Neo-concrete art, affirming the absolute integration of these elements, vouches for the ability of its “geometric” vocabulary to assume the expression of complex human realities, manifest in many works by Mondrian, Malevich, Pevsner, Gabo, Sofia Taeuber-Arp, etc. If even these artists at times confused the concept of mechanical form with expressive form, it is important to clarify that, in the language of art, these so-called geometric forms lose the objective character of geometry in order to become vehicles for the imagination. Gestalt theory, in that it is still a psychology based on the concept of causation, also proves insufficient in helping us understand that phenomenon that dissolves the causally definable realities of space and form and presents them as time, as the spatialization of the work. By “spatialization of the work” is meant the fact that it is continually making itself present,
it is always regaining the impulse that generated it and of which it was, in turn, the origin. And if this description remits us likewise to the first—full—experience of the real, that is because neo-concrete art seeks nothing more than to revive that experience. Neo-concrete art creates a new expressive space.

This position is equally valid for neo-concrete poetry, which condemns in concrete poetry the same mechanicalist objectivism of painting. The rationalist concrete poets also established the imitation of the machine as an ideal for their art. For them, too, space and time are but external relationships between object-words. Now, if that is the case, the page is reduced to a graphic space and the word to an element of that space. As in painting, the visual here is reduced to the optical, and the poem does not transcend the graphic dimension. Neo-concrete poetry rejects such spurious notions and, faithful to the very nature of language, reaffirms the poem as a temporal entity. In time and space, the word unfolds its complex signifying nature. The page in neo-concrete poetry is the spatialization of verbal time: it is pause, silence, time. It is evidently not a matter of returning to the concept of time that characterizes discursive poetry; for while language flows in succession in discursive poetry, in concrete poetry language opens up in duration. Therefore, unlike rationalist concretism, which views the word as object and transforms it into a mere optical signal, neo-concrete poetry restores it to its condition as “verbum,” that is, to the human mode of presentation of the real. In neo-concrete poetry, language does not slip away, but rather remains.

In its turn, neo-concrete prose, opening up a new field for expressive experiments, recovers language as flux, overcoming its syntactical contingencies and giving new, fuller meaning to certain solutions that until now were erroneously accepted as poetry. This is how, in painting as in poetry, in prose as in sculpture and printmaking, neo-concrete art reaffirms the independence of artistic creation in the face of objective knowledge (science) and practical knowledge (ethics, politics, industry, etc.).

The participants in this First Neo-concrete Exhibition do not constitute a “group.” They are not united by dogmatic principles. The evident affinity of their explorations in various fields has brought them together and led them to meet here. The commitment that obliges them commits each one of them, first and foremost, to their individual experience; they will remain together as long as the deep affinity that brought them together endures.

'''NeoSon''' is an artistic movement developed in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], by a group of local artists, [[Tropico Suemba|Josué Pérez]] being  its main exponent. The movement was started in the early 1990s after a two-year tour by Pérez and Carlos "Charly" Garcia (one of the best [[multi-instrumentalist]]s in the country) through 13 countries in [[Latin America]], especially [[Brazil]]. The genesis was prompted by Pérez's perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although [[Mexican art]] has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the country's artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and [[Argentina]]. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]] (regarded as the Mexican [[Woodstock]]) in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normal-records.com/main.php?a=3_Love%20Peace%20Poetry&amp;r=Vol.7%20Mexican Normal Records - Avandaro Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; after which rock music in the country was object of [[political repression|repression]]s by the government, the [[News media|media]] and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maph49.galeon.com/avandaro/ingles/avandaro8.html After Avándaro: the black hole of mexican rock]&lt;/ref&gt; The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians' (and artists in general) creative and social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoson.mex.tl/132531_NeoSon-Manifesto.html NeoSon Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14910">The '''One Dimension Group''' (''Al Bu'd al Wahad'') was a modern art group founded in Iraq, by [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] in 1971 which attempted to combine medieval [[Sufism|Sufi]] traditions with contemporary, abstract art. Although  the One Dimension Group was founded in Iraq, its members originated from across Arab nations, and its influence was felt across the Arab art world. 

==Background==

One Dimension is one of a number of [[Iraqi art#Art groups|art groups]] that formed in 20th-century Iraq. During the first world war, a small group of European officers and artists settled in Iraq, exposing young artists to Western art traditions and techniques. &lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; While local artists and middle classes developed an appreciation for European art, the arts community searched for ways of synthesising indigenous art with international trends. In effect, these groups were seeking to forge an Arabic art aesthetic and to use art to help their nations reassert a sense of national identity. &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between the 1930s and the early 1970s, more than six different art groups were formed: ''The Pioneers'' formed in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Avantgarde Group'' formed in 1950; &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;;  ''[[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]]'' formed in 1951; &lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Impressionists'' formed in 1953;&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, 23–25 November&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Corners Group'' founded in 1961;&lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Innovationists'' founded in 1963;&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Vision'' founded in 1968 and ''One Dimension'' founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these groups endured for decades, while others were short-lived and abandoned within a few years of their formation. &lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9; Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each of these groups developed different ideas about how to combine heritage and modernity and developed a different vision for a national art aesthetic. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of these art groups, the Baghdad Modern Art Group and the One Dimension Group are the most frequently cited.

==Brief history and philosophy==
The One Dimension Group was established formally in 1971 by the prominent Baghdadi artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said, when he published a manifesto for the group.&lt;ref&gt;The manifesto was published in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,'' issue no. 880, p. 8; See: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said had previously been a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art (Jama'at Baghdad lil-Fann al-Hadith) together with [[Jawad Saleem]] (1919-1961) and [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1919-1994), but he along with several high profile artists, had withdrawn from that group when it lost its sense of direction, following the death of its founder, Jawad Saleem in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; 

The One Dimension manifesto gives voice to the group's commitment to both heritage and modernity and sought to distance itself from the modern Arab artists which they perceived as following European artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One Dimension's objectives are complex and sophisticated; it is philosophy, technique, style and a relationship between time and space, between the visual and the non-visual.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109M&lt;/ref&gt; The "one dimension" is an oblique reference to [[Sufism]], which has been described as "the inner dimension of [[Islam]]."&lt;ref&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single "inner dimension". This approach was influenced by both the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the traditions of [[Arabic calligraphy]] and associated [[Sufi]] movements. In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to realise because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52; Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; At a more profound level, one dimension refers to "eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]; also see Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;Al Said explained:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"From a philosophical point of view, the One-Dimension is eternity, or an extension of the past to the time before the existence of pictorial surface; to the non-surface. Our consciousness of the world is a relative presence. It is our self-existence while our absence is our eternal presence." }}

Al Said actively searched for relationships between time and space; and for a visual language that would connect Iraq's deep art traditions with modern art methods and materials. The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this relationship. The letter became part of Al Said's transition from figurative art to abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic calligraphy was charged with intellectual and esoteric Sufi meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95&lt;/ref&gt; in that it was an explicit reference to a Medieval theology where letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said, and members of the One Dimension group, searched for a new artistic identity, drawn from within their own culture and heritage and successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy and Arabic motifs, into contemporary, abstract compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, these artists were carrying out their own dialogue with national identity and modern art, at a broader level they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294; Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said and his group successfully bridged the gap between modernity and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, they "charted a new Arabo-Islamic art aesthetic, and thus initiated a possible alternative for art valuating for local and regional art other than those allowed through an exclusionary Western canon of art history."&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In focusing on the Arabic letter as the central element of his work, al-Said soon was collaborating with [[Madiha Omar]] (who by then was living in the US) and [[Jamil Hamoudi]], who both joined his group.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; The One Dimension Group was very significant to the so-called School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]) which comprised groups of artists that had emerged independently across North Africa and the Middle East in the second half of the 20th century, with the common thread being that each group searched for ways to integrate tradition and modernity in a way that would contributed to a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt;

Although each of these groups developed locally, and went by different labels at the local level, collectively, these groups and their practitioners would become known as the School of Calligraphy (or [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, the movement emerged in the 1950s and was known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'',&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

(eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, artworks took on a slightly different form - since artists rejected Western art traditions and included both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School.'' &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.R., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the One Dimension group include: [[Rafa al-Nasiri]], [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], [[Nuri al-Rawi]], [[Dia Azzawi]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]], Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), Hashim al-Baghdadi (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture'', Kassel University Press, 2017, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panoramic paintings''' are massive artworks that reveal a wide, all-encompassing [[Panorama|view]] of a particular subject, often a [[landscape]], military battle, or historical event. They became especially popular in the 19th century in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], inciting opposition from some writers of [[Romantic poetry]]. A few have survived into the 21st century and are on public display.

In [[China]], panoramic paintings are an important subset of [[handscroll]] paintings, with some famous examples being ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River''.

==History==

{{wide image|Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 2.jpg|1000px|Panorama of a half section of ''[[Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'', 12th century Song Dynasty painting}}

The word "[[panorama]]", from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pan'' ("all") ''horama'' ("view") was coined by the [[Irish people|Irish]] painter [[Robert Barker (painter)|Robert Barker]] in 1792 to describe his paintings of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland shown on a cylindrical surface, which he soon was exhibiting in [[London, England|London]], as "The Panorama".
[[File:Cross-section-of-the-rotund 0.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of the Rotunda in Leicester Square in which the panorama of London was exhibited (1801)]]
In 1793 Barker moved his panoramas to the first purpose-built brick panorama rotunda building in the world, in [[Leicester Square]], and made a fortune.

Viewers flocked to pay a stiff 3 [[shilling]]s to stand on a central platform under a skylight, which offered an even lighting, and get an experience that was "[[Panorama|panoramic]]" (an adjective that didn't appear in print until 1813). The extended meaning of a "comprehensive survey" of a subject followed sooner, in 1801. Visitors to Barker's Panorama of London, painted as if viewed from the roof of Albion Mills on the South Bank, could purchase a series of six prints that modestly recalled the experience; end-to-end the prints stretched 3.25&amp;nbsp;metres. In contrast, the actual panorama spanned 250 square metres.&lt;ref name="comment4"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of Barker's first panorama in Leicester Square, it was neither his first attempt at the craft nor his first exhibition. In 1788 Barker showcased his first panorama.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; It was only a semi-circular view of Edinburgh, Scotland, and Barker's inability to bring the image to a full 360 degrees disappointed him.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; To realize his true vision, Barker and his son, [[Henry Aston Barker]], took on the task of painting a scene of the Albion Mills.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; The first version of what was to be Barker's first successful panorama was displayed in a purpose-built wooden rotunda in the back garden of the Barker home and measured only 137 square metres.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt;

Barker's accomplishment involved sophisticated manipulations of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] not encountered in the panorama's predecessors, the wide-angle "prospect" of a city familiar since the 16th century, or [[Wenceslas Hollar]]'s ''[[Long View of London from Bankside]]'', etched on several contiguous sheets. When Barker first patented his technique in 1787, he had given it a French title: ''La Nature à Coup d' Oeil'' ("Nature at a glance"). A sensibility to the "[[picturesque]]" was developing among the educated class, and as they toured picturesque districts, like the [[Lake District]], they might have in the carriage with them a large lens set in a picture frame, a "landscape glass" that would contract a wide view into a "picture" when held at arm's length.

Barker made many efforts to increase the realism of his scenes. To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed.&lt;ref name="ellis"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Props were also strategically positioned on the platform where the audience stood and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously, however the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to do so.&lt;ref name="comment5"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Houses with single scenes proved more popular to audiences as the fame of the panorama spread.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Because the Leicester Square rotunda housed two panoramas, Barker needed a mechanism to clear the minds of the audience as they moved from one panorama to the other. To accomplish this, patrons walked down a dark corridor and up a long flight of stairs where their minds were supposed to be refreshed for viewing the new scene.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the immense size of the panorama, patrons were given orientation plans to help them navigate the scene.&lt;ref name="comment3"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; These glorified maps pinpointed key buildings, sites, or events exhibited on the canvas.&lt;ref name="comment3" /&gt;
[[File:Detail from Rudolph Ackermann's painting of 1829 Colosseum.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail from ''Bird's Eye View from the Staircase &amp; the Upper Part of the Pavilion in the Colosseum, Regent's Park (1829)'', a coloured [[aquatint]] by [[Rudolph Ackermann]]. Sometimes the viewing position was physically recreated in the panorama's rotunda. The distant image of London shown here is the painted backdrop of the panorama.]]

To create a panorama, artists travelled to the sites and sketched the scenes multiple times.&lt;ref name="comment2"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a team of artists worked on one project with each team specializing in a certain aspect of the painting such as landscapes, people or skies.&lt;ref name="comment2" /&gt; After completing their sketches, the artists typically consulted other paintings, of average size, to add further detail.&lt;ref name="comment2" /&gt; Martin Meisel described the panorama perfectly in his book Realizations: "In its impact, the Panorama was a comprehensive form, the representation not of the segment of a world, but of a world entire seen from a focal height."&lt;ref name="meisel"&gt;Meisel 1983, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Though the artists painstakingly documented every detail of a scene, by doing so they created a world complete in and of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first panoramas depicted urban settings, such as cities, while later panoramas depicted nature and famous military battles.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity for military scenes increased in part because so many were taking place. French battles commonly found their way to rotundas thanks to the feisty leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Henry Aston Barker's travels to France during the Peace of Amiens led him to court, where Bonaparte accepted him.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Henry Aston created panoramas of Bonaparte's battles including ''The Battle of Waterloo'', which saw so much success that he retired after finishing it.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Aston's relationship with Bonaparte continued following Bonaparte's exile to Elba, where Henry Aston visited the former emperor.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; [[Pierre Prévost (painter)]] (1764–1823) was the first important French panorama painter. Among his 17 panoramas, the most famous describe the cities of [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Athens]] and also the battle of [[Wagram]].

Outside of England and France, the popularity of panoramas depended on the type of scene displayed. Typically, people wanted to see images from their own countries or from England. This principle rang true in Switzerland, where views of the Alps dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in America, New York City panoramas found popularity, as well as imports from Barker's rotunda.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; As painter John Vanderlyn soon found out, French politics did not interest Americans.&lt;ref name="comment1"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, his depiction of Louis XVIII's return to the throne did not live two months in the rotunda before a new panorama took its place.&lt;ref name="comment1" /&gt;
[[File:Battery of Raevsky.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nikolay Raevsky|Raevsky]] Battery at Borodino, a fragment of [[Franz Roubaud|Roubaud]]'s panoramic painting]]
Barker's Panorama was hugely successful and spawned a series of "immersive" panoramas: the Museum of London's curators found mention of 126 panoramas that were exhibited between 1793 and 1863. In Europe, panoramas were created of historical events and battles, notably by the Russian painter [[Franz Roubaud]]. Most major European cities featured more than one purpose-built structure hosting panoramas. These large fixed-circle panoramas declined in popularity in the latter third of the nineteenth century, though in the [[United States]] they experienced a partial revival; in this period, they were more commonly referred to as [[cyclorama]]s.

The panorama competed for audiences most frequently with the [[diorama]], a slightly curved or flat canvas extending 22 by 14&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref name="comment7"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama was invented in 1822 by [[Louis Daguerre]] and Charles-Marie Bouton, the latter a former student of the renowned French painter [[Jacques-Louis David]].&lt;ref name="comment7" /&gt;

Unlike the panorama where spectators had to move to view the scene, the scenes on the diorama moved so the audience could remain seated.&lt;ref name="comment6"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Accomplished with four screens on a roundabout, the illusion captivated 350 spectators at a time for a period of 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="comment6" /&gt; The images rotated in a 73 degree arc, focusing on two of the four scenes while the remaining two were prepared, which allowed the canvases to be refreshed throughout the course of the show.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comment6" /&gt; While topographical detail was crucial to panoramas, as evidenced by the teams of artists who worked on them, the effect of the illusion took precedence with the diorama.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Painters of the diorama also added their own twist to the panorama's props, but instead of props to make the scenes more real, they incorporated sounds.&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; Another similarity to the panorama was the effect the diorama had on its audience. Some patrons experienced a stupor, while others were alienated by the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The alienation of the diorama was caused by the connection the scene drew to art, nature and death.&lt;ref name="thomas1"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; After Daguerre and Bouton's first exhibition in London, one reviewer noted a stillness like that "of the grave."&lt;ref name="thomas1" /&gt; To remedy this tomblike atmosphere Daguerre painted both sides of the canvas, known as "the double effect."&lt;ref name="thomas1" /&gt; By lighting both painted sides of the canvas, light was transmitted and reflected producing a type of transparency producing the effect of time passing.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt; This effect gave the crew operating the lights and turning the roundabout a new type of control over the audience than the panorama ever had.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;

In Britain and particularly in the [[United States|US]], the panoramic ideal was intensified by unrolling a canvas-backed scroll past the viewer in a ''[[Moving Panorama]],'' an alteration of an idea that was familiar in the hand-held landscape scrolls of [[Song dynasty]]. First unveiled in 1809 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;Wilcox 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panorama in a rotunda.&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; A precursor to [[Film|"moving" pictures]], the moving panorama incorporated music, sound effects and stand-alone cut-outs to create their mobile effect.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt; Such a traveling motion allowed for new types of scenes, such as chase sequences, that could not be produced so well in either the diorama or the panorama.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, 1983, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast specifically to the diorama, where the audience seemed to be physically rotated, the moving panorama gave patrons a new perspective, allowing them to "[function] as a moving eye".&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;

==Romantic criticism of panoramas==

The panorama's rise in popularity was a result of its accessibility in that people did not need a certain level of education to enjoy the views it offered.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, patrons from across the social scale flocked to rotundas throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt;

While easy access was an attraction of the panorama, some people believed it was nothing more than a parlor trick bent on deceiving its public audience. Designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer, the panorama was placed in the same category as propaganda of the period, which was also seen as deceitful.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The locality paradox also attributed to the arguments of panorama critics.&lt;ref name="ellis" /&gt; A phenomenon resulting from immersion in a panorama, the locality paradox happened when people were unable to distinguish where they were: in the rotunda or at the scene they were seeing.&lt;ref name="ellis" /&gt;

Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. [[Hester Piozzi]] was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt; She did not like seeing so many people – elite and otherwise – fooled by something so simple.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt;

Another problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with, namely, by redefining the sublime to incorporate the material.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2006, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes and in so doing, made the sublime accessible to every person with 3 shillings in his or her pocket.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity. By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat to romanticism, which was obsessed with the sublime.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2006, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; According to the romantics, the sublime was never supposed to include materiality and by linking the two, panoramas tainted the sublime.

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of ''[[The Prelude]]''.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity.&lt;ref name="haut"&gt;Haut 2009, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; He felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt; Wordsworth was offended by the fact that so many people found panoramas irresistible and concluded that people were not smart enough to see through the charade.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt; Because of his argument in "The Prelude," it is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which one he saw; there is no substantial proof he ever went, other than his description in the poem.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Jones 2006, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Wordsworth's hatred of the panorama was not limited to its deceit. The panorama's association with the sublime was likewise offensive to the poet as were other spectacles of the period that competed with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As a poet, Wordsworth sought to separate his craft from the [[phantasmagoria]] enveloping the population.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, phantasmagoria refers to signs and other circulated propaganda, including billboards, illustrated newspapers and panoramas themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their pretense: the panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves.&lt;ref name="haut" /&gt; Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation depicted in the panorama and appreciate it for what it was – art.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt;

Conversely, some critics argue Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but was rather hesitant about it.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; A main argument is that other episodes in ''The Prelude'' have just as much sensory depth as panoramas had.&lt;ref name="jones1"&gt;Jones 2006, p. 366-367&lt;/ref&gt; Such depth could only be accomplished through imitation of the human senses, something both the panorama and ''The Prelude'' succeed at.&lt;ref name="jones1" /&gt; Therefore, since both the panorama and ''The Prelude'' imitate the senses, they are equal and suggest Wordsworth was not entirely opposed to panoramas.

A modern take on the panorama believes the enormous paintings filled a hole in the lives of those who lived during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="comment"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Comment said in his book ''The Painted Panorama,'' that the masses needed "absolute dominance" and the illusion offered by the panorama gave them a sense of organization and control.&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt; Despite the power it wielded, the panorama detached audiences from the scene they viewed, replacing reality and encouraging them to watch the world rather than experience it.&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt;

==Surviving panoramas==
Relatively few of these unwieldy ephemera survive. The oldest known surviving panorama (completed in 1814 by [[:de:Marquard Wocher|Marquard Wocher]]) is on display at [[Schadau Castle]], depicting an average morning in the Swiss town of [[Thun]]. As of today it is owned by the [[Gottfried Keller-Stiftung|Gottfried Keller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="hds-GKS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D11909.php|title=Gottfried Keller-Stiftung|publisher=HDS|author=Claude Lapaire|language=German|date=2006-11-14|accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landbote-20111123"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landbote.ch/index.php?id=18&amp;tx_vsarticle_pi1%5Barticle%5D=171093|title=Bund greift Gottfried-Keller-Stiftung unter die Arme|publisher=[[Der Landbote]]/sda|author=|language=German|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2014-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208015305/http://www.landbote.ch/index.php?id=18&amp;tx_vsarticle_pi1%5Barticle%5D=171093|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rare surviving great-circle panorama is the [[Panorama Mesdag]], completed in 1881 and housed in a purpose-built museum in [[The Hague]], showing the dunes of nearby [[Scheveningen]]. Both of these works are considered of interest as they depict domestic scenes of their times. Depictions of warfare were more common as subject matter, [[Panorama of the Battle of Waterloo|an example]] of which is located at the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], depicting the [[Battle of Waterloo|battle]].

An exhibition "Panoramania" was held at the [[Barbican Arts Centre|Barbican]] in the 1980s, with a catalog by [[Ralph Hyde]]. The [[Racławice Panorama]], currently located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], is a monumental (15 × 120&amp;nbsp;metre) panoramic painting depicting the [[Battle of Racławice]], during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]]. A panorama of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] is on display at [[Mamayev Kurgan]]. Among [[Franz Roubaud]]'s great panoramas, those depicting the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854)|Siege of Sevastopol]] (1905) and [[Battle of Borodino]] (1911) survive, although the former was damaged during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)]] and the latter was transferred to [[Poklonnaya Gora]]. The [[Pleven Panorama]] in [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]], depicts the events of the [[Siege of Plevna]] in 1877 on a 115×15-metre canvas with a 12-meter foreground.

Five large panoramas survive in [[North America]]: the [[Cyclorama of Jerusalem]] (a.k.a. the Panorama of Jerusalem at the Moment of Christ's Death) at St. Anne, outside of [[Quebec City]]; the [[Gettysburg Cyclorama]] depicting [[Pickett's Charge]] during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]; [[John Vanderlyn]]'s Panorama of the Garden and [[Palace of Versailles]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]] and the [[Atlanta Cyclorama]], which depicts the [[Battle of Atlanta]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. A fifth panorama, also depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, was willed in 1996 to [[Wake Forest University]] in [[North Carolina]]; it is in poor condition and not on public display. It was purchased in 2007 by a group of North Carolina investors who hope to resell it to someone willing to restore it. Only pieces survive of a massive cyclorama depicting the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

In the area of the [[moving panorama]], there are somewhat more extant, though many are in poor repair and the conservation of such enormous paintings poses very expensive problems. The most notable rediscovered panorama in the [[United States]] was the Great Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress, which was found in storage at the [[York Institute]] now the Saco Museum in [[Saco, Maine]], by its former curator Tom Hardiman. It was found to incorporate designs by many of the leading painters of its day, including [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], and [[Henry Courtney Selous]] (Selous was the in-house painter for the original Barker panorama in London for many years.)

The [[St. Louis Art Museum]] owns another moving panorama, which it is conserving in public during the summers of 2011 and 2012. "The Panorama of the Monumental Grandeur of the Mississippi Valley" — the only remaining of six known Mississippi River panorama paintings—measures {{convert|90|in|m|order=flip|abbr=off}} wide by {{convert|348|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} long and was commissioned {{circa|1850}} by an eccentric amateur archaeologist named Montroville W. Dickeson. [[Judith H. Dobrzynski]] wrote about the restoration in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303836404577474852766704394 an article in the Wall Street Journal dated June 27, 2012].

In 1918, the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] acquired the [http://whalingmuseumblog.org/2010/08/04/revisiting-the-content-and-context-of-russell-and-purrington%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98grand-panorama-of-a-whaling-voyage-round-the-world%E2%80%99/ Grand Panorama of a Whaling Voyage Round the World], created by artists Benjamin Russell and Caleb Purrington in 1848. At about {{convert|1295|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8+1/2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high, it is one of the largest surviving moving panoramas (although far short of the "Three Miles [4800&amp;nbsp;m] of Canvass" advertised by its creators in their handbills). The Museum is currently planning for the [http://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/collections/panorama conservation] of the Grand Panorama. Although in storage, highlights may be seen on the Museum's [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nbwm/sets/72157623043914197/with/4861121110/ Flickr] pages

Another moving panorama was donated to the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University Library in 2005. Painted in Nottingham, England around 1860 by John James Story (d. 1900), it depicts the life and career of the great Italian patriot, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (1807–1882). The panorama stands about {{convert|4+1/2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|273|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, painted on both sides in watercolor. Numerous battles and other dramatic events in his life are depicted in 42 scenes, and the original narration written in ink survives.

The ''[[Arrival of the Hungarians]]'', a vast cyclorama by [[Árpád Feszty]] ''et al.'', completed in 1894, is displayed at the [[Ópusztaszer National Heritage Park]] in [[Hungary]]. It was made to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the 895 conquest of the [[Carpathian Basin]] by the Hungarians.

The Cyclorama of Early Melbourne, by artist John Hennings in 1892, still survives albeit having suffered water damage during a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/cyclorama-of-early-melbourne#.V7L1jGV4X8s |title=Only Melbourne Cyclorama of Early Melbourne |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Only Melbourne|publisher=Ripefruit Media Co. |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted from a panoramic sketch of Early Melbourne in 1842 by Samuel Jackson. It places the viewer on top of the partially constructed Scott's Church on Collins Street in the Melbourne CBD. Commissioned to celebrate 50 years of the city of Melbourne, it was displayed in the Melbourne Exhibition Building for nearly 30 years before being taken into storage. Relatively small for a Cyclorama, it measured {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00433b.htm |title=eMelbourne Cycloramas |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2008 |website=eMelbourne - The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online |publisher=School of Historical &amp; Philosophical Studies, The University of Melbourne |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Biological museum (Stockholm)]], founded by hunter and taxidermist Gustaf Kolthoff, opened its dioramas to the public in November 1893 and is still an active museum with about 15000 visitors yearly. The museum has panorama paintings by [[Bruno Liljefors]] (assisted by [[Gustaf Fjæstad]]), Kjell Kolthoff and several hundred preserved animals in their natural habitats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23363">'''Post-expressionism''' is a term coined by the German [[art critic]] [[Franz Roh]] to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by [[expressionism]] but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, "Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism", to contrast to [[Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub]]'s "[[New Objectivity]]", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw "post-expressionism" and "[[Magic Realism (painting)|magic realism]]" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==

Leading up to [[World War I]], much of the art world was under the influence of [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]] in the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation &amp;mdash; of other artists or of the outside world &amp;mdash; and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution &amp;ndash; bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people &amp;ndash; and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around [[angst]] &amp;mdash; inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled ''[[Menschheitsdämmerung]]'', which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” &amp;mdash; meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a [[Return to Order|return to order]] and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine ''[[Valori Plastici]]'' and came together in the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. [[Mario Sironi]], a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==

When Hartlaub defined the idea of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', he identified two groups: the ''verists'', who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the ''classicists'', who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by [[de Chirico]]'s concept of ''[[metaphysical art]]'', which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic [[Wieland Schmeid]] in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right &amp;mdash; many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it&amp;mdash; and the ''verists'' we associate as the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' on the left &amp;mdash; fighting against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett 1998, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to [[Flemish Expressionism]], as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as ''animism''.

===Magic Realism===

'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.”&lt;ref&gt;Zamora and Ferris 1995&lt;/ref&gt; With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us &amp;mdash; how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and ''metaphysical art'', a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps [[Antonio Donghi]], who kept to traditional subject matter &amp;mdash; popular life, landscapes, and still life &amp;mdash; but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of [[naive art]]. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, [[Anton Räderscheidt]] followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. [[Georg Schrimpf]] is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by [[primitivism]].

[[Filippo De Pisis]], who is often associated with ''metaphysical art'', can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian ''animists''. His association with ''metaphysical art'' comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a [[magic realism|magic realist]] is [[Felice Casorati]], whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are [[Alexander Kanoldt]] and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

===New Objectivity and Verism===

{{Main|New Objectivity}}
[[File:George grosz-the eclipse of the sun.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''The Eclipse of the Sun'' by George Grosz, 1926]]
The artists most associated with the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

[[Bertolt Brecht]], a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, ''Baal'' and ''Trommeln in der Nacht'' (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ''verist'' critique of expressionism was influenced by [[Dadaism]]. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest &amp;mdash; shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by [[Raoul Hausmann]], and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of [[John Heartfield]]. Use of collage in these works became a ''compositional'' principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]]. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other ''verist'' artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized "an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin", according to Schmied.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied 1978, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

{{Main|Animism (art)}}
[[File:Wolvens, Bont strandzicht, reduced size.jpg|thumb|430px|left|''Bont strandzicht'' by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977.]]
In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like [[James Ensor]] and [[Louis Pevernagie]] who had combined expressionism with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the [[Latemse School]], where adherents like [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Hubert Malfait]] used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism.
[[File:Jespers, floris-still life with coffeepot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne'' by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war.]]
Belgian art critic [[Paul Haesaerts]] later gave this movement the title ''animism'', which he took from anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]]'s book ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) describing '[[animism]]' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms ''réalisme poétique'' and ''intimism'', although ''animism'' is still most commonly used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumhermandecuyper.be/evolutie_animisme_en.htm|title= ''Artistic evolution: animism'' |publisher = Museum Herman De Cuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intimism'' will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291874/Intimism|title= ''Intimism'' |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized painter of these artists is [[Henri-Victor Wolvens]], who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at [[Oostende]]. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches &amp;mdash; rougher when in storm &amp;mdash; and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement &amp;mdash; so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of [[Floris Jespers]] was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are [[Anne Bonnet]], [[Albert Dasnoy]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Mayou Iserentant]], [[Jacques Maes]], [[Marcel Stobbaerts]], [[Albert Van Dyck]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[War Van Overstraeten]] and [[Jozef Vinck]].

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

[[George Grard]] is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with [[Charles LePlae]], who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

[[Herman De Cuyper]] is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to [[Henry Moore]].

==Counter-movements==

An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]''.

===Romantic Expressionism===

{{Main|Scuola Romana}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mafai, fantasia no 9 , 1942.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''Fantasia n.9 &amp;mdash; Fucilazione'' by Mario Mafai, 1942]] --&gt;
[[Corrado Cagli]] was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or ''nuovi pittori romani'' (new Roman painters).&lt;ref&gt;''Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome)'' on "Quadrante" (I, 1933 n.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an ''Astro di Roma'' (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
{{quote|''In a primordial dawn all has to be reconsidered, and Imagination relives all wonders and trembles for all mysteries.''}}

Sometimes referred to as ''romantic expressionism'', art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Barilli, ''L'arte contemporanea: da [[Cézanne]] alle ultime tendenze'', Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: "... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as [[Chagall]], made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Raphaël, who had known him in [[Paris]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione]] brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

[[Mario Mafai]] painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled ''Demolitions'', where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of ''Fantasies'' depicting horrors committed by the fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte Moderna'', [[Milan]] 1990, pp.613-616&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonietta Raphaël]], Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was [[Renatto Guttuso]], who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

[[Emanuele Cavalli]] and [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] have associations both with the ''Scuola Romana'' and with Magic Realism.

'''Pseudorealism''', also spelled '''pseudo-realism''', is a term used in a variety of discourses connoting [[art]]istic and dramatic techniques, or work of art, film and literature perceived as superficial, ''not-real'', or non-realistic.&lt;ref name="ELS-AM"&gt;Eric Loren Smoodin, Ann Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Fs0Vwa_nQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xaHOTtSkB8OViQKC6LXPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;f=false ''Hollywood quarterly: film culture in postwar America, 1945-1957.'' Page 235.] ''University of California Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the term is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="huxley"&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/  A Defence Of Paradise-Engineering.] ''BLTC Research'', 1998. ''Use of term: pseudo-realism.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term pseudo-realism has been used to describe a certain type of cultural commodities such as film productions and TV programmes which portray everyday life in excessively realistic detail in order to achieve greater impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture Industry Revisited: Theodor W. Adorno on Mass Culture |author=Prof. Deborah Cook |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UtwDwenWBwC&amp;q=pseudo-realism |pages=46, 100 |ISBN=0847681556}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the great shift towards expressionism in painting, André Bazin used the word ''pseudoreal'' in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, [[photorealist]]ic CGI animation and [[3D computer graphics]] used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the [[special effects]] augmenting feature film through photographic deception of the eye have gained an entirely different dimension.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Surman |url=https://www.academia.edu/168038/CGI_Animation_Pseudorealism_Perception_and_Possible_Worlds  |title=CGI Animation - Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=GameCareerGuide.com (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer generated imagery and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds.  
{{quote|We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms – a fundamental deception of the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a deception of the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they are the product of man-made parameters. — David Surman, "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" &lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens equates ''pseudo-realism'' with [[Socialist realism]] of the Stalinist era as exposed by Orwell.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GnOe11NJXUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=definition+of+pseudo-realism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4f_qyMo9cg&amp;sig=VUkTJ3B4EpDI3VQTv8Bu9cIqhsk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iprOToTmOYPKiALAnP28Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20pseudo-realism&amp;f=false  ''Why Orwell Matters''.

Formed by combining the words "puppet" and [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]], the term originated in the [[Northeastern United States]] and quickly picked up use in the [[Southern United States|South]], [[Midwest]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States]], as well as in [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]], to describe a social movement of [[revolutionary]] artists and their work.

A '''spoke card''', or '''spokecard''', is a [[:wikt:card|card]] placed in the [[spokes]] of a [[bicycle wheel]]. They lie parallel to the entire wheel. Most spoke cards are [[laminated]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, [[playing cards]] were placed in such a way as to make a [[noise]] as the card flaps against the spokes; however, there is no evidence that these were called "spoke cards."

==Origins==
One origin of the spoke card was laminated cards inserted in spokes with numbers used to identify competitors in competitive races held by [[bicycle messenger]]s, in official competitions and in unofficial [[alleycat races]].&lt;ref&gt;FixedGearGallery. [http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/spokecards.htm Subject: Spoke Cards.] (retrieved 8 Jan 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tarot]] cards with the racers number written on them were used initially,&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Phillip. [http://www.phillipdillon.com/?p=185 "The Tarodome Alleycat."] 17 July 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but nowadays cards are often custom printed.

Another influence was the practice of placing [[playing card]]s found on the street in bicycle spokes in a game known in 1990s San Francisco as [[Spokepoker]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Parté. "Spokepoker." ''Mess Press.'' Issue 1, 1991: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The spoke card is wedged between the spokes of the wheel at the point where they cross each other. Although the spoke card is hard to read while the bicycle is in motion, it provides a cheap way to label them in the absence of a proper race number plaque under the top tube, and is less likely to attract the attention of the authorities than a number on the rider's back.

Maps for social bicycle rides have been printed on spokecards for the riders's reference.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many messengers retain spoke cards after the event, accumulating several on the wheel. Other city riders sometimes fix spoke cards to their wheels as an affectation of messenger culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindycog.com/labels/alleycat.html "Oaks Day Alleycat."] ''IndyCog.'' 18 March 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Many times participants of large group rides, such as those organized by groups like the [[Midnight Ridazz]] or [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] receive spoke cards and affix them to their spokes.

Spoke cards have evolved to serve such diverse functions as [[memorial]]s for fallen messengers, as [[Works of art|artwork]], and as political [[placard]]s in bike messenger association elections, and even in the [[2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obamaspoke.com/ "One Man Spoke."] (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044848/http://obamaspoke.com/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Amy Walker advocates using spoke cards as advertising fliers,&lt;ref&gt;Amy Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7OHlBI4xCLMC&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''On Bicycles: 50 Ways the New Bike Culture Can Change Your Life.''] New World Library, 2011. Page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this can be controversial since many cyclists do not appreciate strangers touching their bicycles.

[http://www.BikeIndex.org Bike Index], a bike registration service, provides instructions for printing spoke cards with [[QR codes]] that contain information about the particular bicycle and its registration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bikeindex.org/spokecard "Spoke cards."] ''Bike Index'' (retrieved February 16, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1995 by [[Faber and Faber]], the novel was adapted for the stage in 2009 and explores Muslim [[fundamentalism]], youth culture, sex, drugs, and alienation in a young British-Pakistani man’s world that is being pulled in different directions by a modern lifestyle of London and traditional [[Muslim]] culture.

Kureishi, a British-Pakistani novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker, premiered the adaptation at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in July 2009 and was awarded the second [[Asia House]] Literature Award on the closing night of [[Asia House Festival of Asian Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Anita M.|title=Power and Civil Society In Pakistan|date=September 20, 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character List ==

* '''Shahid''' (''Protagonist)'': The son of Pakistani immigrants, a British-Pakistani student from Kent, UK, whose father has recently died. Shahid moves to London for college, seeking to find a sense of independence in identity.
* '''Chili''' : Shahid’s older brother
* '''Deedee''' : Shahid's lecturer professor/lover/mentor
* '''Riaz''' : Shahid's friend, and means of introduction into radical [[Islam]]

== Critical reception ==
Although only having been staged recently, the reception to ''The Black Album'' has been neutral when compared to the Kureishi's novel. Many felt that the stage adaptation left out many of the details that made the novel memorable and powerful, instead feeling that the adaptation lost many of the details that readers felt were so elegantly explained in the novel.

"But the stage version does scant justice to the book's panoramic portrait of late-1980s London with its pubs, clubs and ecstasy-filled raves. In a nutshell, one misses the heady exuberance of Kureishi's descriptive writing." -''The Guardian''{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The reception to the timing of the adaptation of the novel was positive as it came in the post-9/11 era of the world view. Kureishi had thought, back in the Nineties, of turning his novel into a film but it never happened. But a decade and a half on, in the wake of 9/11, 7/7 and the "war on terror", the relevance of the story became even greater. In an interview with production team, it was asked: "Was it easy ... transforming the tale from page to stage? "The novel had a kaleidoscopic view of London," he says, "moving quickly from episode to episode. The play maintains that episodic sense. Hanif has retained a lot of the language of the original. The novel is full of deft wit. The play is too. It moves between the real and the absurd. Hanif calls it 'hyper-real'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Album: A Work In Progress|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/the-black-album-a-work-in-progress-1754288.html|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12071">'''Tingatinga''' (also spelt '''Tinga-tinga''' or '''Tinga Tinga''') is a painting style that developed in the second half of the 20th century in the [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]] area in [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]) and later spread to most East Africa. Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, [[Kenya]] and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter [[Edward Said Tingatinga]].
[[File:Tingatinga school paintings.JPG|thumb|The Tingatinga school of painting sold their work in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam. Picture from 1973]]

Tingatinga is traditionally made on [[masonite]], using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the [[Big Five Game|big five]] and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of "[[airport painting]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-112811/exploring-tingatinga-art-movement-tanzania Exploring the Tingatinga Art Movement in Tanzania]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings themselves can be described as both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[caricature|caricatural]], and [[humor]] and [[sarcasm]] are often explicit.

Edward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Tanzania]] (Dar es Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_art.html |title=Tinga Tinga art |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed low cost materials such as [[masonite]] and [[bicycle paint]] and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[surrealism|surrealistic]] style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the "Tingatinga school".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm The tingatinga school of painting]. This is an informal term (i.e., those who paint after Tingatinga's example) and not to be confused with the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, which is a specific organization, although sometimes also referred to as a "school".  {{cite web |url=http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917035235/http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]). One of the most well known second-generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, [[Simon Mpata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm Tingatinga first students]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507131843/http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm |date=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought-after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like ''The lion'', ''Peacock on the Baobab Tree'', ''Antelope'', ''Leopard'', ''Buffalo'', or ''Monkey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |title=Are Tingatinga fakes a problem today? |publisher=Alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314042953/http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com/ |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:wall painting ngapa1.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], the village of E.S.Tingatinga's father]]
[[File:wall painting ngapa3.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in Ngapa depict animals in a [[naive art|naïve style]] that might resemble Tingatinga art]]

It is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper ''Tingatinga and His Followers'', [[Sweden|Swedish]] critic Berit Sahlström claimed that Tingatinga was of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] paintings that were sold in [[Dar es Salaam]] at his times.&lt;ref&gt;"Art in Tanzania 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this claim could be some articles by Merit Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards.

The claim by Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] wall decorations of [[Makua people|Makua]] and [[Makonde people]]. These paintings were first witnessed by [[Karl Heule]] in 1906 and described in his book ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Weule (1908), ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika'', Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Jesper Kirknaes]] and Japanese painting curator [[Kenji Shiraishi]], as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today.

Jesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shiraishi, ''Commentary to Tingatinga II''; article: ''Tinga TingaContemporary African Art and Mural''; ''Tingatinga: Afurikan poppu-ato no sekai'' / Kenji Shiraishi and Fumiko Yamamoto. Tokyo: Kodansha, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Thorup and Chitra Sundaram (2010), ''Tingatinga, Kitsch or Art'', p. 22; article: ''Off the walls to Hard Board and Canvas; What inspired Tingatinga?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Further elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls painting and traditional [[rock art|rock paintings]], an art form that in Africa has continued past [[stone age]] to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the "longest artist trend ever".&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shirashi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos'', Africa Hoy, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tingatinga Cooperative Society==
After Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, [[Simon Mpata]], and Omari Amonde &lt;ref&gt;Mwasanga, National Arts Council, Mture Publishers, Tingatinga, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the "Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway.&lt;ref&gt;Abdellahamani Hasani&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to '''Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society''' (TACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_cooperative.html |title=Tingatinga Co-operative Society |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the TACS is usually recognized as the most authoritative representative of the Tingatinga heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SomaliPress.com |url=http://www.somalipress.com/guides/culture/tanzania-tingatinga-arts-achievement.html |title=Tingatinga Arts Achievement |publisher=Somalipress.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a small fraction of Tingatinga artists are directly linked to this society.

The Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website on May 2018: [Http://Www.tingatingaArt.com www.tingatingaArt.com]

==Tingatinga and George Lilanga==

Although the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist [[George Lilanga]] was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lilanga| first = George| title = Colors of Africa| year = 2007| isbn = 978-88-89298-32-9| page = 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''George Lilanga'', Kamphausen&lt;/ref&gt; This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of [[enamel paint]] and square [[hardboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See K. Shiraishi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy'', p. 7. The book reports Lilanga's words as follow: ''It was entirely my own idea to incorporate this style. Nobody suggest I do it. In the Tingatinga style, I use enamel paint on hardboard. This board is excellent for achieving vivid color."&lt;/ref&gt; Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Masceloni, ''Catalogue Raisonne, George Lilanga'', p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] style, that shares the same [[horror vacui]] of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Thorup| first1 = Tine| last2 = Sam| first2 = Cuong| title = Tingatinga Kitch Or Quality Bicycle Enamel on Board &amp; Canvas| year = 2011| isbn = 978-87-992635-2-3| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as [[Noel Kapanda]] and later [[Mchimbi Halfani]], who collaborated with him.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.lilanga.org Lilanga.org] and [http://www.makonde-carvings.info Makonde Carvings] websites&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.&lt;ref&gt;K.

'''''Trompe-l'œil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tʁɔ̃p lœj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70]]
[[File:Colyer, Edwaert - Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Trompe-l'œil painting by [[Evert Collier]]]]
[[File:Escaping criticism-by pere borrel del caso.png|thumb|''Escaping Criticism'' by [[Pere Borrell del Caso]], 1874]]

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'œil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) and [[Melozzo da Forlì]] (1438–1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sù|di sotto in sù]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489–1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460–1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'œil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting.  Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'œil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'œil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence – An Interview with Cinematographer István Borbás|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'œil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'œil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].

'''Visionary art''' is [[art]] that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of [[awareness]] including [[supernatural|spiritual]] or [[mystical]] [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s, or is based in such experiences.&lt;ref name="AlexGrey"&gt;[http://alexgrey.com/media/writing/essays/what-is-visionary-art/ What is Visionary Art? by Alex Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alex Grey - COSM 4.jpg|thumb|[[The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors]] by [[Alex Grey]].]]

==History==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |title=Academy of Visionary Art |access-date=2014-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312142009/http://academyofvisionaryart.com/information/visionary-art |archive-date=2014-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionaryrevue.com/webtext/manifesto.contents.html ''Manifesto of Visionary Art'' by L. Caruana]&lt;/ref&gt; Its artists included [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], [[Rudolf Hausner]] and [[Arik Brauer]] among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including [[Mati Klarwein]], [[Robert Venosa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venosa.com/bio.html Robert Venosa biography]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Rubinov Jacobson]] and [[De Es Schwertberger]].

==Definition==
[[File:Laurence caruana in his Bastille studio.jpg|thumb|Visionary artist [[Laurence Caruana]] with visionary art paintings.]]
Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness.&lt;ref name=AlexGrey /&gt; Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Psychedelic art]] are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[William Blake]], [[Morris Graves]] (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), [[Emil Bisttram]], and [[Gustave Moreau]] amongst their antecedents.

==Schools and organizations==
The [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism]], which includes [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Arik Brauer]], is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

The [[Society for the Art of Imagination]], founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern [[artist collectives|cooperatives]] involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as [[Burning Man]] and [[Boom Festival]], and exhibition/ritual spaces such as [[Temple of Visions]], Tribe 13, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the [[Interdimensional art|Interdimensional Art]] Movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
