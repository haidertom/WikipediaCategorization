The '''1998 killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan''' refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], in the [[Taliban]]-[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|controlled]] [[Afghanistan]] during the Taliban and [[Northern Alliance]] [[battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)|battles of Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead, bringing the total deaths to 11.&lt;ref name="Tehran Times"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film on 1998 Iranian diplomats’ murder in Mazar-i-Sharif premieres in Tehran|journal=Tehran Times|date=August 25, 2015|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/248916/Film-on-1998-Iranian-diplomats-murder-in-Mazar-i-Sharif-premieres|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings of the diplomats is speculated to have been carried out by [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0451-5|pages=66–67|edition=2nd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Further|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)}}
Before this incident, Iran was supportive of the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], and the city of Mazari Sharif was one of the headquarters of the alliance. It is reported that between May and July 1997 [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] executed thousands of Taliban prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. "He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=BBC News |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a revenge, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif and killed hundreds of Northern Alliance members, particularly members of the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic group as they were accused of being the ones who carried out the killings of Taliban prisoners.

==Events==
On August 8, 1998, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran's state news agency ([[IRNA]]) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Aftermath==
This incident caused a public furor in Iran and many observers were worried Iran would be involved in a military response to the attack. At the time, more than 70,000 Iranian troops were deployed along the Afghan border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''2007 Morocco–Spain diplomatic conflict''' was a short lived disturbance of [[Morocco–Spain relations|international relations between Morocco and Spain]] that arose after the announcement of the impending visit of the [[King of Spain]] to the Spanish-ruled  autonomous cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which are claimed by Morocco.

The dispute formally began when the [[Government of Morocco]] recalled its ambassador to Spain, Omar Azziman. According to a diplomatic note from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco]], "The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty [[King Juan Carlos I]], on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives."&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/expresa/rechazo/viaje/Reyes/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071102elpepinac_16/Tes|title= Marruecos expresa su rechazo al viaje de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco expresses its rejection of the King's trip to Ceuta and Melilla|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elpais2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/llama/consultas/embajador/Espana/elpepuesp/20071102elpepunac_12/Tes|title= Marruecos llama a consultas a su embajador en España|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco calls its ambassador in Spain|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation."&lt;ref name="elpais2"/&gt;

The royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the Kings in both Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/301030/0/ceuties/reciben/reyes/|title= Veinticinco mil personas recibieron en Ceuta a Don Juan Carlos y a Doña Sofía|date= November 5, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Twenty thousand people to receive Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Ceuta|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=1814_43_574968__Espana-Juan-Carlos-destaca-Melilla-sincera-amistad-vecinos|title= Don Juan Carlos destaca en Melilla "la sincera amistad de España con sus vecinos"|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[La Nueva España]]|location= Melilla|language= Spanish|trans-title=Don Juan Carlos highlighted at Melilla "the sincere friendship of Spain with its neighbors"|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, [[Abbas El Fassi]], compared the situation in both cities with the [[Israeli occupation of Palestine|Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories]] and [[King Mohammed VI]] himself described the visit as an "outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era."&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/equipara/Ceuta/Melilla/Palestina/ocupada/Israel/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_5/Tes|title= Marruecos equipara Ceuta y Melilla con la Palestina ocupada por Israel|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco equates Ceuta and Melilla with Israel occupied Palestine|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="condemnation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/condena/visita/real/advierte/Espana/consecuencias/elpepuesp/20071107elpepinac_2/Tes|title= Mohamed VI condena la visita real y advierte a España de las consecuencias|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI condemned the royal visit of Spain and warned the consequences|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in [[Tetuan]], as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Cientos/personas/reivindican/Tetuan/marroquinidad/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071104elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Cientos de personas reivindican en Tetuán la "marroquinidad" de Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 4, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Hundreds of people claim the "Moroccanness" of Ceuta and Melilla in Tetuan|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country.

Finally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], visited [[Rabat]] to meet his Moroccan counterpart, [[Taib Fassi Fihri]] on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/entrega/Marruecos/carta/Zapatero/dara/pie/vuelta/embajador/elpepuesp/20080103elpepunac_1/Tes|title= Moratinos entrega a Marruecos una carta de Zapatero que dará pie a la vuelta del embajador|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 3, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos delivered letter of Zapatero to Morocco will trigger the return of the ambassador|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/anuncia/regreso/embajador/frio/comunicado/elpepuesp/20080107elpepunac_6/Tes|title= Marruecos anuncia el regreso de su embajador con un frío comunicado|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 7, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco announces the return of its ambassador with a cold statement|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal visit==
[[File:Juan Carlos 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia.]]

On October 30, the [[Government of Spain]] announced the visit of King [[Juan Carlos I]] and Queen [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofia]] to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], had told that fact to the opposition leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed.

The King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as [[Prince of Asturias]] on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Spanish Legion]].

The last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king [[Alfonso XIII]], who was last seen in 1927, and President of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], [[Niceto Alcala Zamora]], on 4 November 1933.&lt;ref name="elpais6"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Rey/destaca/visita/Ceuta/cumple/compromiso/pendiente/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_3/Tes|title= El Rey destaca que su visita a Ceuta cumple un "compromiso pendiente"|first= Tomás|last= Bárbulo|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King emphasizes that his visit to Ceuta serves a "pending commitment"|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/299476/0/visita/oficial/reyes/|title= Los Reyes visitarán por primera vez de forma oficial Ceuta y Melilla|date= October 31, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King will officially visit Ceuta and Melilla for the first time|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the [[Assembly of Ceuta|Assembly]] of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he "had an pending commitment to Ceuta". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, [[Elena Salgado]], or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco.&lt;ref name="elpais6"/&gt; The King was welcomed by 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"/&gt;

On November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the [[Assembly of Melilla|Assembly]]. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that "Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors." The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"/&gt;

==Additional background of the conflict==
A month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the [[National Court of Spain]], [[Baltasar Garzón]], had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the [[Polisario Front]]. Moroccan spokesman said that "it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/internacional/0711/01115819.htm|title= Marruecos dice que Garzón debería preocuparse por los DDHH en Tinduf y no por el presunto genocidio saharaui

As stated by [[Yassine Mansouri]], Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in [[Mallorca]], the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco]]; and to bet on movements like the [[Tablig]] (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Mansouri informed this to [[Alberto Saiz]], Director of National Intelligence of Spain.

The position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the ''Commander of the Faithful'' and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, [[Laarbi Maateis]], is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with [[jihadism]]. He also said the prosecution were not understandable "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/provincias/ceuta/articulo/ceuta_espana_marruecos_2113293.htm|title= Maateis recuerda que el rito musulmán malekita se practica 'en Ceuta, en el resto de España y en Marruecos|date= December 11, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Maateis recalls that Maliki Muslim rites are practiced in Ceuta, in the rest of Spain and in Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/acusa/Espana/echar/musulmanes/ceuties/brazos/integrismo/elpepuesp/20071210elpepinac_9/Tes|title= Marruecos acusa a España de echar a los musulmanes ceutíes en brazos del integrismo|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 10, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco accuses Spain to drive the Muslims into the arms of fundamentalist Ceuta|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Moroccan government==
[[File:Mohammed VI of Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mohamed VI.]]

The [[Prime Minister of Morocco]], [[Abbas El Fassi]], reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to "waive" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, [[Khalid Naciri]], expressed the "total rejection and condemnation" of the royal visit to "despoiled Moroccan cities." Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict "must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.

{{Quote|Decolonization continues to be topical in the few spots that remain in the world, including occupied Palestine, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla ....}}

The same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, [[Mustafa Ramid]], by manifesting in the Parliament that "the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization."&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt;

===Manifestations of King Mohamed VI===
On November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the [[Green March]] in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman:&lt;ref name="condemnation"/&gt;
{{quotation|Strongly we express our strong condemnation and as firmly denounce this unprecedented visit. [...] Given this act was to overcome a nostalgic and dark era, the Spanish authorities must assume their responsibility for the consequences that could jeopardize the future and the development of relations between both countries. [...]}}

In the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities:
{{quotation|It is well established that the best way to resolve conflict and manage this land requires respect for the virtues of an honest dialogue, frank and open about the future, a dialogue that ensures our right to sovereignty and to take into account the interests of Spain. [...] Morocco has continued to demand an end to the Spanish occupation of Ceuta and Melilla and nearby islands in the plundered north of the kingdom.}}

===Reactions of the Moroccan government after the visit of the King===
On 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish "place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis." Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that "our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/quiere/Espana/le/coja/mano/superar/juntos/crisis/diplomatica/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_11/Tes|title= Marruecos quiere que España "le coja la mano" para superar juntos la crisis diplomática|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 15, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco wants Spain "to hold their hand" to overcome diplomatic crisis together|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Minister of Public Works]], [[Magdalena Álvarez]], who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport [[Karim Ghellab]] about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the [[Strait of Gibraltar|strait]] (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the [[Army of Spain]], Admiral [[Sebastian Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Marruecos/muestra/enfado/cancelando/visita/ministra/Fomento/elpepuint/20071117elpepuint_6/Tes|title= Marruecos muestra su enfado cancelando una visita de la ministra de Fomento|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 17, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco shows its anger by canceling a visit of the Minister of Development|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Spanish Government==
On the same day, November 1, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain]], [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], who was visiting the Moroccan city of [[Marrakech]], reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister [[Taieb Fassi-Fihri]], despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] said that relations with the Moroccan government "were extraordinary" and the journey of the Kings fell within the "institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in [[Rabat]], Spanish diplomatic sources said.&lt;ref name="elpais3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/retira/embajador/pone/relacion/borde/crisis/elpepunac/20071103elpepinac_1/Tes|title= Mohamed VI retira a su embajador y pone la relación al borde de la crisis|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI withdraws its ambassador and put the relationship on the verge of crisis|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, Defense Minister [[Jose Antonio Alonso]], in a statement to the [[Cadena SER]] said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit.&lt;ref name="elpais4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Parlamentarios/marroquies/convocan/protesta/Embajada/Espana/lunes/elpepuesp/20071103elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Parlamentarios marroquíes convocan una protesta ante la Embajada de España el lunes|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moroccan parliamentarians convened a protest outside the Embassy of Spain on Monday|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed on November 14 its confidence in the return of the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid "as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|title= Confía Moratinos en rápido fin de la crisis con Marruecos|publisher= El Financiero|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos confident quick end to the crisis with Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612084731/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|archivedate= June 12, 2008|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reactions==

===Political reactions in Spain===
The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] and [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] political parties, through [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Gaspar Llamazares]], respectively, announced their support for the visit of the King of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; [[Gustavo de Arístegui]], of the People Party, termed Mohamed VI's reaction as "excessive" and criticized the Spanish Prime Minister for failing to make clear, in his view, the 'red lines' that Morocco could not cross.&lt;ref name="elpais3"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Elena Valenciano]], International Relations Secretary of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], stressed that the visit was part of "the most absolute institutional normality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europapress.es/00069/20071102152534/marruecos-psoe-cree-desafortunados-algunos-comentarios-rabat-visita-reyes-ceuta-melilla.html|title= PSOE cree desafortunados algunos comentarios de Rabat sobre la visita de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=PSOE believes Rabat's certain comments on the visit of the Kings to Ceuta and Melilla as unfortunate|accessdate= December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Melilla]], [[Juan José Imbroda]], said that "it is not the time to make opposite sounding declarations", in reference to the Moroccan position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/provincias/melilla/articulo/imbroda_marruecos_recuerda_visita_real_1983880.htm|title= Imbroda recuerda a Marruecos que la visita real sólo atañe a los españoles|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Imbroda reminds Morocco that the royal visit only involves the Spanish|accessdate= December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coalition for Melilla]], the prime Muslim-based opposition party in the autonomous city, manifested itself as extremely pleased with the visit the King, adding that the presence of the King of Spain was a "historic debt in this city and which, from this formation, we always advocate for the occurrence of the visit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/articulo/coalicion_melilla_rey_1983763.htm|title= Coalición por Melilla muestra su 'satisfacción' por la visita del Rey pero crítica que no se cuente con la oposición|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Coalition for Melilla shows its "satisfaction" for the King's visit but not critical on the opposition count|accessdate= December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, the [[President of Ceuta]], [[Juan Jesus Vivas]], merely issued an edict in which he urged the citizens to welcome the King, honor him by the presence of Ceutans, and "you will honor yourselves, our city and our beloved country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vivas pide a los ceutíes que rindan un 'homenaje de adhesión' a los Reyes |url=http://terranoticias.terra.es/nacional/articulo/vivas_reyes_ceuties_rindan_homenaje_1983652.htm |date=November 3, 2007 |publisher=Terra Actualidad |language=Spanish |trans-title=Vivas asks Ceutans to hold a "tribute accession" for the King |accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''affair''' is a [[sexual relationship]], [[romantic friendship]], or [[Passion (emotion)|passionate attachment]] between two people without the attached person's [[significant other]] knowing.

==Romantic affair==
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - The Stolen Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Stolen Kiss (Fragonard)|The Stolen Kiss]]'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]
A romantic affair, also called an affair of the heart, may refer to sexual liaisons among unwed or wedded parties, or to various forms of [[forms of nonmonogamy|nonmonogamy]]. Unlike a [[casual relationship]], which is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may [[having sex|have sex]] without expecting a more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic.
Affair may also describe part of an agreement within an [[open marriage|open marriage or open relationship]], such as [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], [[dating]], or [[polyamory]], in which some forms of [[extramarital sex|sex with one's non-primary partner(s)]] are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as [[infidelity]] and may be experienced as [[adultery]], or a [[betrayal]] both of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] and [[integrity]], even though to most people it would not be considered "illicit".

When a romantic affair lacks both overt and covert sexual behavior and yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional intimacy it may be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.

=={{anchor|extramarital affair}} Extramarital affair==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tess]], from [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and from [[Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti]]--&gt;
{{main|Infidelity|Legitimacy (family law)|Adultery|Extramarital sex}}
Extramarital affairs are relationships outside of [[marriage]] where an illicit [[romantic love|romantic]] or [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationship or a [[romantic friendship]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]]ate attachment occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extramarital|title=Definition of EXTRAMARITAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and remarriage, could be considered the primary relationship and the marriages secondary to it. Several people claim the reason of extra marital affair as their unsuccessful marriage and that both spouses failed to please each other. This may be serial polygamy or other [[forms of nonmonogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strean|first1=Herbert S.|title=The Extramarital Affair|date=1980|publisher=Free Press|accessdate=18 November 2015|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Extramarital_Affair.html?id=iDnWSAfBnnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and [[conflict of interest]] inherent in the practice, requires skill in [[deception]] and duplicitous [[negotiation (process)|negotiation]]. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious [[gaslighting]]. All these behaviors are more usually called [[lie|lying]].{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Deception can be defined as the "[[covert]] manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs". The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of [[fidelity]], of reciprocal [[vulnerability]] and of [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed [[intimacy|intimate]] relationship.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Individuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others,&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/hate-the-husband-sue-the_b_311419.html |title=Hate the Husband? Sue the Mistress! |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-10-07|accessdate=2010-03-01 |first=Jacob M. |last=Appel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S.&amp;nbsp;states permitted such [[alienation of affections]] lawsuits.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Online affair==
The appearance of [[computer-mediated communication]] introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of "affair". There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ze'ev|title=Flirting On and Offline|journal=International Journal of Research in to New Media Technologies|year=2004|volume=10|issue=24|url=http://con.sagepub.com/content/10/1/24.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships. 

Ben Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair—termed "detached attachment", or just "detachment"—that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lea &amp; Spears|title=Love at first Byte|journal=Understudied Relationships|year=1995|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: "I'm not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyberlove101.com, story 39|title=An Enchanting Belgian gentleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11913">{{about|authority as a concept of political philosophy||}}

'''Authority''' is the [[Legitimacy (political)|right]] to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be formalized by a [[State (polity)|state]] and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other [[deity|deities]]. 

A governing body may be labelled an authority e.g. the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] or the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. ''Authority'' can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.

In [[government]], ''authority'' is often used interchangeably with ''power''. However, their meanings differ: while ''power'' is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, ''authority'' refers to a claim of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the justification and right to exercise that power. For example, while a [[Crowd|mob]] may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or [[lynching]], the [[rule of law]] indicates that only a [[court]] of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment. In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to [[Decision-making|make decisions]], but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power. Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the [[Republicanism|republican]] conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in [[ancient Rome]].

== History ==
[[Ancient history|Ancient]] understandings of authority trace back to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and draw later from Catholic ([[Thomism|Thomistic]]) thought and other [[Tradition|traditional]] understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)|last=Widyono|first=Benny|date=Oct 2014|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; public authority in the form of [[Popular Power|popular power]], and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Legislative Delegation of Authority to Bureaucratic Agencies|last=Krause|first=George A.|date=2010|work=The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Durant|editor-first=Robert F.|location=New York, NY|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of authority can extend to national or individual [[sovereignty]], which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is [[Legitimation|legitimated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sovereignty|last=Glanville|first=Luke|date=|work=The Oxford Handbook of the Responsibility to Protect|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|editor-last=Bellamy|editor-first=Alex J.|location=New York, NY|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of [[Geneva]], and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laitin|first=David|date=1998|title=Toward a Political Science Discipline: Authority Patterns Revisited|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=31|issue=4|pages=423-443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.

== Political philosophy ==
There have been several contributions to the debate of [[political authority]]. Among others, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Carl Schmitt]] have provided some of the most remarkable texts.

In [[political philosophy]], the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of [[sovereignty]], the balancing of freedom and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hegel on Freedom and Authority|last=Cristi|first=Renato|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the present. Most [[democracy|democratic]] societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of [[government]]al authority. In the [[United States]], for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable, and that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as [[limited government]].

In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority, there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual, otherwise known as [[Philosophical anarchism|political anarchism]]. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as [[statism]]. Sovereignty, in modern terms, can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty, or autonomy, of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti-statism is made by [[Michael Huemer]] in his book ''[[The Problem of Political Authority]]''. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the “[[Social contract|social contract theory]]” developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1668 book, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']], or by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his political writings on [[The Social Contract|the social contract]]. 

== Sociology ==
Since the emergence of the [[social sciences]], authority has become a subject of research in a variety of [[empirical]] settings: the family (parental authority), small groups (informal authority of [[leadership]]), intermediate organizations such as schools, churches, armies, industries and bureaucracies (organizational and bureaucratic authorities), and society-wide or inclusive organizations, ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization (political authority).

The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (1919) divided legitimate authority into [[Authority (sociology)|three types]]. Others, like [[Howard Bloom]], suggest a parallel between authority and [[Veneration of the dead|respect/reverence for ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The understanding of political authority and the exercise of [[Political power in the United States over time|political powers]] in the American context traces back to the writings of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], including the arguments put forward in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the First Chief Justice of the United States [[John Jay]], and later speeches by the 16th President of the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]]. "Our government rests in public opinion," President Abraham Lincoln said in 1856 Related to the Authority of the Sanatana Kingdom .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1854 Speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused "the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own," a principle existing "at the foundation of the sense of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of [[Limited government|self-government]] as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a [[Republicanism|Republican]] nation and its people. This was because, as Abraham Lincoln also declared, "No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3840">The '''Bannu Resolution''' ({{lang-ps|د بنو قرارداد}}), or the '''Pashtunistan Resolution''' ({{lang-ps|د پښتونستان قرارداد}}), was a formal political statement adopted by Pashtun nationalists in [[Bannu]] that demanded the British offer the the option of independence, rather than choosing between the independent [[dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. The British refused the request, and the region voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining Pakistan in a July 1947 referendum.

== History ==
The resolution was adopted on June 21, 1947, seven weeks before the [[Partition of British India]], by [[Bacha Khan]], [[Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai]], the [[Khudai Khidmatgars]], members of the Provincial Assembly, [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs at a [[loya jirga]] held at [[Bannu]], in [[British India]]’s [[North-West Frontier Province]].

The resolution demanded that [[Pashtuns]] be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]], composing all Pashtun territories of British India - an exemption from the British plan to award territories in British India to either Pakistan or India. 

== British refusal ==
The [[British Raj]] refused to consider the resolution’s demands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  because in July 1947, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] declaring that by 15 August 1947 it would divide [[British India]] into the two new independent [[dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] - with no option for further independent states.

The act also declared that the fate of the North West Frontier Province would be subject to the result of [[referendum]]. This was in accord with the June 3rd Plan proposal to have a referendum to decide the future of the Northwest Frontier Province—to be voted on by the same electoral college as for the Provincial Legislative Assembly in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Pearson|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== July 1947 Referendum ==
Voters in the [[Khyber Pakthunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] voted overwhelmingly in favor of Pakistan versus India in the referendum held in July 1947. 289,244 (99.02%) votes were cast in favor of Pakistan,&lt;ref name="prr.hec.gov.pk"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://prr.hec.gov.pk/Chapters/1159S-3.pdf |title=Electoral History of NWFP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810052331/http://prr.hec.gov.pk/Chapters/1159S-3.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.om/books?id=NRsuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=referendum+nwfp+1947&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVp879k6beAhXMD8AKHS9kBG8Q6AEITTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=referendum%20nwfp%201947&amp;f=false|title=A Century of Crisis and Conflict in the International System: Theory and Evidence: Intellectual Odyssey III|accessdate=25 July 2017|author=Michael Brecher|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; although turnout was low.

'''Bao Luong''' (1909-1976) was born Nguyen Trung Nguyet (“faithful moon), in the rural [[Bình Đại District]] of Vietnam’s [[Bến Tre Province]].  She was a member of the [[Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League]], a communist group fighting against French rule in Vietnam. She became the first female political prisoner in Vietnam. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Passion, Betrayal, and the Revolution in Colonial Saigon: The Memoirs of Bao Luong|last=Ho Tai|first=Hue-Tam|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

= Early life =
Nguyen Trung Nguyet grew up on her parents farm in Binh Dai. Although few girls received an education at this time, Nguyen Trung Nguyet went to an all-boys night school run by her uncle. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2011/03/bao-luong|title=Brief Life of Bao Luong|last=Ho Tai|first=Hue Tam|date=2011|website=Harvard University Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At nine years old her family moved from Binh Dai to [[Rạch Giá|Rach Gia]] (now [[Kiên Giang Province|Kien Giang]]), and at age twelve, they again uprooted to Phuoc Long (now part of [[Bạc Liêu Province|Bac Lieu Province]]). Her father, Nguyen van Nham, was a French resistor, and told her stories of anticolonial resistance. He encouraged her to write patriotic poems and question the French rule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At her age, most young Vietnamese women were expected to be married, but Nguyen Trung Nguyet did not want to be distracted from the revolution against the French. Trung Nguyet often tried to persuade her parents to let her leave home to engage in revolutionary activities, but they resisted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the Spring of 1927, Nguyen Trung Nguyet left home for Saigon, where she stayed with her aunt, Kim Oanh and her uncle Ton Duc Thang. Around the time she left home, Nguyen Trung Nguyet adopted the name Bao Luong (“Precious Honesty”), which she had originally used as a pen name while writing poetry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

= Activism =
Her uncle, [[Tôn Đức Thắng|Ton Duc Thang]] was the leader of the southern section of the [[Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After four months, during which Ton Duc Thang assessed Bao Luong’s interest and potential, she was recruited to join the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League. Training for the Youth League was in Guangzhou, China, and before boarding the boat, Bao Luong’s family disguised her as a boy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her true identity was discovered only after she gained the trust and loyalty of the other revolutionary activists on board. In Guangzhou, Bao and the other trainees attended lectures on revolutionary ideologies, evolution, and the socialist movement.  At the training school, Bao wrote poetry and other articles for the cause. When her training was complete, she went back to her family in Phuoc Long.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Her first task was to convince her family to support her efforts in the revolution, and her parents vowed to support her and keep her secret&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  She went on to recruit women to join the revolution. Bao Luong traveled throughout the Mekong Delta pretending to sell fabric. Along the way, she gathered women that supported the Revolutionary Youth League. Many of these women hoped that the revolution would lead to education reforms and the freedom to choose their own husbands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bao Luong then received permission to start an all-women cell of the Revolutionary Youth League. She hosted meetings that gathered women from a wide geographical area, spanning five regions. All female meetings were unprecedented at the time, and Bao’s superiors warned her to be more careful. At these meetings, the women decided to use poetry to spread the anticolonial message, and used stories of exemplary women throughout history to help make their points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

= Murder on Barbier Street =
Bao Luong’s passionate fight against French rule led her to become involved in an assassination plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWald|first=Erich|date=June 2013|title=Patronage, Passion, and the Power of Networks|url=|journal=Cross Currents: East Asian History and Culture Review|volume=7|pages=118–120|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 1928, Le van Phat was found in his home on Barbier Street.  Le van Phat was known as Lang to the members of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was the chairman of the Saigon Provincial regional committee of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was accused of forcing a younger member of his cell to become his mistress. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.B|date=October 1998|title=The Foundation of the Indochinese Communist Party, 1929-1930|url=|journal=Cambridge University Press Modern Asian Studies|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began abusing power, disrespecting orders, and missing meetings. Bao Luong chaired the meeting where the decision to execute Lang's murder was made.  She directed members at the meeting to draw ballots to see who would commit the murder and three men (including Bao Luong's cousin) were selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bao Luong drafted a love letter which was used to make sure Lang would be home at the time of the murder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her cousin and the two other men attempted to kill Lang with poison, before slitting his throat. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League was against the murder and ordered the Saigon cell to disband. This group went on to become the Communist Party of Indochina. After Bao Luong and her fellow Saigon cell members refused, an anonymous letter was sent to the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police]], known as the [[Sûreté|Surete]], that implicated Bao Luong and other league members in the murder of Lang. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

= Imprisonment and later life =
Bao Luong was beaten in prison, as the Surete tried to get her to confess. She was then moved to the Saigon Central Prison, where she awaited trial. At her trial, she spoke out to the French judge about the poor treatment of women in French Indochina and maintained her revolutionary ideas. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;She was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, but her behavior in court added three more years to her sentence. The men who committed the murder were sentenced to death.  Her mentor and uncle, Ton Duc Thang, served a short prison sentence before becoming the president of [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In prison, a male nurse who cared for Bao Luong fell in love with her. Through an intermediary, the nurse (Nguyen van Thom) asked her family for her hand in marriage. After being questioned by the head of the prison for his plans to marry Bao Luong upon her release, Nguyen van Thom quit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After Bao's release, the two moved to O Mon and had children. She was later encouraged to rejoin the revolution, but denied the invitation to care for her children and in-laws. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20718">'''Biometric voter registration''' implicates using [[Biometrics|biometric technology]] (capturing unique physical features of an individual – [[fingerprinting]] is the most commonly used), most of the times in addition to demographics of the voter, for [[Voter registration|polling registration]] and/or [[Electronic authentication|authentication]]. The enrollment infrastructure allows collecting and maintaining a database of the biometric templates for all voters.

A biometric voting project might include introducing biometric registration kits for enrolment of voters; using electronic voter identification devices before and on Election Day; issuing of voter [[Identity document|identification documents]] (i.e. biometric voter cards), among others. The chronological stages for adopting a biometric voting registration project usually include assessment; feasibility studies; securing funding; reviewing legislation; doing [[Mock election|pilot projects]] and mock registration exercises; procurement; distribution of equipment, installation, and testing; recruitment and [[Electoral education|training]] of staff; voter information; deployment and, [[Election audits|post-election audits]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/introducing-biometric-technology-in-elections.pdf|title=Introducing Biometric Technology in Elections|last=Wolf|first=Peter|date=2017|publisher=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/361712092|title=Biometric Voter Registration: Skills required and problems encountered?|publisher=aceproject.org|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final aim of implementing biometric election technology is achieving [[de-duplication]] of the voting register,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/biometrics_in_elections_2011_0.pdf|title=Biometrics in Elections|last=Holtved|first=Ole|date=February 2011|publisher=International Foundation for Electoral Systems and USAID}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus preventing multiple voter registration and multiple voting; improving identification of the voter at the polling station, and mitigating the incidence of [[voter fraud]] (e.g. buy/rent of voters IDs before an election).

However, it is vital that commissions carrying out these election projects first and foremost guarantee that the legal framework supports biometric voter identification,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf|title=Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?|publisher=Privacy International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/11/biometrics-development-aid-work|title=Using biometrics in development: lessons and challenges|last=Gelb|first=Alan|date=2013-02-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-18|last2=Clark|first2=Julia|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then that the data captured during the registration process will be secured while maintaining two basic requirements: personalization and privacy. Likewise, it is imperative to have contingency mechanisms in place, in case biometric systems malfunction. One of the main challenges is to ensure that given the eventualities of technological hitches and failures, not a single voter is disenfranchised.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/electoral-advice/archive/questions/replies/916219364|title=Biometric Voter Registration and Voter Identification|publisher=aceproject.org|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries with biometric voter registration ==
According to [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|International IDEA]]'s ICTs in Elections Database,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/icts-elections|title=ICTs in Elections Database|publisher=International IDEA|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2016, the number of [[Countries applying biometrics|countries adopting biometrics]] in elections has steadily increased to over 50, with significant differences between regions. "While there are virtually no users in Europe, about half of the countries in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] use this technology in elections."&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; 35 per cent of over 130 surveyed Electoral Management Bodies is capturing biometric data (such as fingerprints or photos) as part of their voter registration process (2016).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countries which have used Biometric voting registration include Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/blog/2017/03/10/new-voter-authentication-devices-vads-tested-in-armenia/|title=New Voter Authentication Devices (VADs) tested in Armenia|publisher=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/armenia/293071|title=Parliamentary Elections, 2 April 2017|publisher=OSCE|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angola,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_14382-1522-2-30.pdf?080902095246|title=Angola votes!

== Advocacy and criticism ==
Some promoters of biometric voting registration point out that this technology, if properly customised to the country's needs and well implemented, could offer better accessibility for citizens; help avoiding long queues and waiting times for registration and voting; add simplicity and speed to the election cycle (i.e. voter identification documents can make it easier for polling staff to verify voter details);&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; make voters and Commissions feel confident about the quality of their registry (more accurate, reliable and complete data); improve e-voting security,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://findbiometrics.com/mcafee-atlantic-council-joint-study-sees-important-role-for-biometrics-in-e-voting/|title=McAfee-Atlantic Council Joint Study Sees Important Role for Biometrics in e-Voting|date=2014-10-08|work=FindBiometrics|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2016/10/voting-online-made-possible-with-selfie-recognition-technology/|title=Voting online made possible with selfie recognition technology|date=2016-10-17|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; considerably reduce or eliminate multiple registration and multiple voting, while mitigating the risk of impersonation, identity theft, the misuse of records of deceased voters, carousel voting and ballot-box stuffing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, those who criticise and disapprove the use of biometrics for voter identification maintain that using biometrics for election purposes raises concerns over voters' privacy, human dignity and governmental disclosure of personal information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/biometrics-coming-along-serious-security-concerns/|title=Biometrics Are Coming, Along With Serious Security Concerns|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics go further to claim that biometrics in voting poses a serious threat to democracy, due to fears of violation of the secrecy of the vote (or correlation voter-vote).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/analysis-of-biometric-voter-registration-and-voting-process-in-sierra-leone|title=Analysis of Biometric Voter Registration and Voting Process in Sierra Leone|last=Vanguard|first=The Patriotic|date=2011-10-02|work=The Patriotic Vanguard|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerns as with any other application of biometrics for identification and authentication can be manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ccD1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170|title=Adopting Biometric Technology: Challenges and Solutions|last=Das|first=Ravindra|date=2016-04-21|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4987-1745-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There is, for example, the possibility of voter disenfranchisement when characteristics typically used to identify or verify voters might become unavailable (e.g. bandaged finger, loss of a finger, failure to acquire due to dirt or fingerprint quality degradation).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Similarly, there are also claims of potential logistical and procedural "new problems" that biometric identification devices can bring to an election cycle: increasing costs (initial purchase costs of biometric readers and infrastructure, costs linked to maintenance, storage and upgrades) and resources' allocation (human, time, material); additional training of commissions and polling staff, technological failures that could disenfranchise voters; and extra data storage that demands higher security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19491">[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] wearing his black beret]]
The '''black beret''' is a type of headgear commonly worn by armoured forces around the world including the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR), the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]] (RCAC), and the [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]] (RAAC). Notable non-armoured units to wear the black beret include the [[Russian Naval Infantry]] (and formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) and [[Russia]]n [[OMON]] units, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Tactical Air Control Party]] (TACP), [[Philippine National Police-Special Action Force]] (PNP-SAF) members, and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ("navy blue"). It was also worn by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Observer Corps]] (ROC) with their [[Royal air force|Royal Air Force]] (RAF) uniform, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA).

Perhaps the most famous Commonwealth wearer of the black beret was [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] who wore a [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR) beret complete with [[cap badge]], presented to him by the regiment, to which he added his own [[general]]'s (later [[field marshal]]'s) [[British Army officer rank insignia|rank insignia]].

==Original usage==
The black beret has its origins with the French 70th [[Chasseurs Alpins]] who influenced the British Royal Tank Corps beginning in 1918. General Sir [[Hugh Jamieson Elles]], together with Colonel Fuller came up with the idea of a black beret for the Royal Tank Corps. Black was selected as the colour because it was least likely to show oil stains, something which tank crewmen of that time (and now) could appreciate. It was approved for wear with the [[Royal Tank Corps]] by HM [[King George V]] on 5 March 1924.

The Black Beret remained the exclusive distinctive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps  in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australian-armour.com/Black%20Beret.html,&lt;/ref&gt;

When uniforms were issued to the [[Royal Observer Corps]] there was a surplus of Royal Armoured Corps black berets that were given to the unit.

==United States military usage==
In the United States military, the beret was unofficially worn by a variety of special operations units during and following World War II. In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at [[Camp Carson]], Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.
===Black berets in the U.S. Air Force===
[[File:Earning the black beret 150417-F-GO396-301.jpg|thumb|[[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|US Air Force's Tactical Air Control Party]] beret, flash, and crest]]
In 1979, the black beret was authorized for wear by enlisted personnel in the Tactical Air Control Party. In 1984, two airmen from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina submitted the current flash and badge design. It was approved for all TACP airmen in 1985. Tactical Air Control Party specialists (AFSC 1C4X1) are currently the only United States Air Force specialty allowed to wear the coveted black beret as part of their daily duty uniform wear.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Military Beret History (Page 2)". Usmilitary.about.com. 2001-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black berets in the U.S. Army===
[[File:YoungestBeret1stBattalion23rdInfantryRegiment.jpg|right|thumb|A soldier from 1st Bn, [[23rd Infantry Regiment|23rd Inf Reg]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd ID]] wearing the black beret (2001)]]
In 1973, permission was granted to local commanders to encourage distinctive, morale-enhancing uniform items and the black beret was adopted by armor and armored cavalry units in the United States.

A black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;p.223 Stanton, Shelby ''U.S. Army Uniforms of the Cold War 1948–1973'' 1994 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1975, it was officially assigned as part of the newly created battalions of [[United States Army Rangers]] who had worn it unofficially during the Vietnam War.

In 1979, the army chief of staff ruled that the black beret was restricted to just ranger and airborne units (the latter receiving their distinctive maroon berets on November 28, 1980). However, since June 14, 2001, the black beret is worn by all [[United States Army]] troops unless the soldier is approved to wear a different distinctive beret. The Rangers now wear [[tan beret]]s in reverence to the buckskins worn by [[Rogers' Rangers]] during the [[French and Indian War]].

The black beret is worn as part of the [[Army Service Uniform]] (ASU), the U.S. Army's dress uniform. It also became the official garrison headgear to be worn with the [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDUs) in 2001, and from 2005 the [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU). The change was implemented by General [[Eric Shinseki]], the Army Chief of Staff at the time, who stated that it was about promoting "...our values as an institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defense Leaders Uphold Army's Black Beret Decision (Corrected Copy) |url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45776 |website=archive.defense.gov |accessdate=June 16, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the beginning, the beret was unpopular with soldiers, because the headgear required two hands to put it on, could not be carried in the pocket when not worn (as the patrol cap could), and provided no shade from the sun when worn.

Despite years of negative feedback, the beret remained part of the ACU until 2011, when incoming Sergeant Major of the Army [[Raymond F. Chandler]] made it his first order of business to address the wishes "thousands of soldiers" who wanted the army to end the wear of the beret with the ACU, and the army subsequently did just that.&lt;ref name="Army Dumps Beret"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army dumps beret as official ACU headgear|url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220043908/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Pierce-Lunderman | first1=Cursha | title=Bye-Bye, Beret: Switch to Patrol Cap Brings Mixed Feelings | url=https://www.army.mil/article/60276/Bye_bye__beret__Switch_to_patrol_cap_brings_mixed_feelings | date=June 23, 2011 | publisher=U.S. Army| accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Shaughnessy | first1=Larry | title=Army Backtracks on Black Berets After More than a Decade of Debate | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/13/army.beret/ | date=June 14, 2011 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black beret remained the headgear for the ASU, but was replaced as the default headgear with the ACU patrol cap.&lt;ref name="Beret replacement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=C.

===Black berets in the U.S. Navy===
====Male black beret====
During the [[Vietnam War]] the U.S. Navy personnel assigned to [[Patrol Boat, River|patrol boats]] wore the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy|South Vietnamese navy]] black beret with badge. Unit tradition had the back ribbon cut into two pennants after first contact with the enemy with the ends of the pennant notched in a "V" to signify he had made an enemy "kill".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Cutler|Cutler, Thomas J.]] (2000) ''Brown Water, Black Berets''. Naval Institute Press, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Female black beret====
Until October 2016, a black beret was authorized to be worn,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/uniforms/uniformregulations/Documents/01NOVSOC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070521043303/http://buperscd.technology.navy.mil/bup_updt/508/unireg/chapter3/3500_seriesArticles/3501_3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; albeit solely by female U.S. Navy sailors of all ranks.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110831052528/http://timemilitary.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/unif-navy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Female commissioned officers wore the U.S. Navy officer crest on the beret above the left eyebrow, female petty officers and seamen wore the combination cover's device, and female chief petty officers wore their rate insignia instead. The female black beret's usage was discontinued along with the officer's tiara by the navy in 2016 as part of a naval effort to reduce the number of uniform items, make them appear more unisex, and also due to a lack of widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NAVADMIN 208/15|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2015/NAV15208.txt|date=September 2015|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage around the world==

In the [[Turkish Land Forces]], the black berets are worn by Armor personnel.

In the [[Polish Armed Forces]], the black berets are worn by armored units of [[Polish Army]], and by [[Polish Navy]].

In the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], an oversized black beret was introduced during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] for [[panzer]] crews, to be worn over the crash helmet; however this was dropped in favour of a black [[garrison cap]] during [[World War II]]. Today the black beret (of conventional size) is worn by the Armoured Corps and the Armoured Reconnaissance Corps.

A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70383">[[Civil service]] [[reform]] is a deliberate action to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, professionalism, representativity and democratic character of a [[civil service]], with a view to promoting better delivery of [[public goods]] and services, with increased [[accountability]]. Such actions can include data gathering and analysis, organizational [[restructuring]], improving [[human resource management]] and [[training]], enhancing [[wages|pay]] and [[Employee benefit|benefits]] while assuring [[sustainability]] under overall [[finance|fiscal]] constraints, and strengthening measures for [[performance management]], [[public participation]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]],  and combating [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/civil-service-reform/|title=Civil service reform - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil service reform agenda in [[Developing country|developing countries]] has evolved and changed its focus over the decades. The [[academic literature]] on civil service reform has provided arguments and counterarguments clarifying how several approaches to reform affect the overall performance of the civil service.  The increasing availability of empirical [[data]] allows to test the [[effectiveness]] of specific reforms in a given context. While designing effective civil service reforms is a tremendously complex task considering that the right mix of corruption control and performance improvements may vary greatly across and within countries, [[Empirical research|empirical]] as well as [[qualitative research]] can contribute to the body of evidence-based knowledge on civil service reforms in developing countries.

Many challenges remain as persisting [[political economy]] factors hinder the success of civil service reforms.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simone|first=Bunse|last2=Verena|first2=Fritz|date=2012-08-01|title=Making public sector reforms work : political and economic contexts, incentives, and strategies|pages=1–54|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/649411468328580569/Making-public-sector-reforms-work-political-and-economic-contexts-incentives-and-strategies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to Civil Service Reform ==

=== The Influence of Weberian Bureaucracy ===
[[Max Weber]]'s model of the ideal type of [[public administration]] has been an influential approach to civil service reforms in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/capacity-building/global-centre-for-public-service-excellence/PS-Reform.html|title=From Old Public Administration to the New Public Service|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bureaucratic]] type of administration contrasts with the [[Inheritance|patrimonial]] type in its underlying organizing principles. Weber’s organization of the public administration relies on a clearly defined hierarchical structure with a system of subordination and supervision, a division of labor and specified positions with assigned responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udy|first=Stanley H.|date=1959|title="Bureaucracy" and "Rationality" in Weber's Organization Theory: An Empirical Study|jstor=2088566|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=791–795|doi=10.2307/2088566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the patrimonial system in which there is no distinction between private and public domains, the [[Weberian bureaucracy]] is defined by its impersonal and impartial character. Civil servants operate according to a set of rules and procedures they must observe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlström|first=Carl|last2=Lapuente|first2=Victor|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2009|title=Bureaucracy, Politics and Corruption|ssrn=1450742|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impartiality is in part attained through the professionalization of the civil service and [[meritocratic]] recruitment through competitive examinations.  For full-time and professionalized civil servants, public office-holding becomes a 'vocation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weberian [[ideal-typical]] principles have served as foundations for civil service reforms in developing countries. Scholars and policymakers have been interested in identifying the specific features that determine bureaucratic efficiency and corruption and the mechanisms through which these features increase effectiveness and restrict corrupt behaviour in the civil service.

Empirical studies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Bureaucratic structure and bureaucratic performance in less developed countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272799000444|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=49–71|doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00044-4|issn=0047-2727|last1=Rauch|first1=James E.|last2=Evans|first2=Peter B.|citeseerx=10.1.1.203.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that meritocratic recruitment of public officials in particular is associated with lower corruption levels.  There are several ways in which meritocratic recruitment and promotion can restrict corrupt behaviour. To begin with, administering entry examinations and educational attainment requirements enable the selection of competent civil servants. As a matter of fact, a study by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/03/arezki.htm|title=Degrees of Development- Finance &amp; Development, March 2013|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that better-educated civil servants are related to lower levels of corruption, better performance including better public finance management and higher [[tax revenue]] mobilization as well as higher [[economic growth]].

Furthermore, the internal promotion and career stability of merit-recruited civil servants create a sense of shared commitment to the 'vocation' of office-holding that establishes '[[Esprit de corps|esprit de corps']], making it harder for corruption to occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other evidence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggests that a professional merit-based civil service preempts corruption not necessarily through the selection of capable officials but rather through the appointment of civil servants whose interests differ from politicians'. Misaligned interests create a coordination problem which prevents corrupt practices and instead introduces a system of mutual monitoring.

=== Employment and Pay Reforms ===
During the 1980s, developing countries subject to [[structural adjustment]] programs (SAPs) experienced fiscal austerity notably manifested through pressures to reduce the public wage bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Nunberg|date=1989-12-31|title=Public sector pay and employment reform : a review of World Bank experience|pages=1|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424331468739769767/Public-sector-pay-and-employment-reform-a-review-of-World-Bank-experience|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]] raised concerns that falling civil service wages could exacerbate bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1989-04-01|title=Incentive myopia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X89902544|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=447–459|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(89)90254-4|issn=0305-750X|last1=Klitgaard|first1=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low public sector wages have been associated with lower performance and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990-07-01|title=Internal adjustments to falling civil service salaries: Insights from Uganda|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X90900829|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1003–1014|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(90)90082-9|issn=0305-750X|last1=Chew|first1=David C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries below [[opportunity cost]] can induce civil servants to opt for potentially harmful adaptive strategies and seek opportunities for own-account activities. Public officials may ask for compensation through informal or illegal means and these coping strategies compromise the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations.

Given these arguments, increasing public officials' wages and other employment benefits has been an important aspect of the civil service reform agenda in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/civilservice/mayseminar/Mukherjee.pdf|title=Civil Service Pay and Reward|last=Mukherjee|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models based on the early work of [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|last2=Stigler|first2=George J.|date=1974-01-01|title=Law Enforcement, Malfeasance, and Compensation of Enforcers|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1086/467507|issn=0047-2530}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a particular influence on the policy debate.

[[Principal–agent problem|Principal-agent]] models of corruption in the civil service provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between public service pay and corruption.  The shirking model ([[Shapiro–Stiglitz theory|Shapiro-Stiglitz]]) is centred on the choice public officials who have the opportunity to be corrupt must make. These [[Rationality|rational]] [[Utility maximization problem|utility-maximizing]] agents decide to engage in [[Moral hazard|morally hazardous]] behaviour based on a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] equating the expected returns to corruption ([[Bribery|bribes]]) to the costs of being corrupt (penalties, potential foregone future earnings).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/do-higher-salaries-lower-petty-corruption-a-policy-experiment-on-west-africa-s-highways|title=Do higher salaries lower petty corruption? A policy experiment on West Africa's highways - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is detected with a certain probability and is punished by job loss or other penalties. The model predicts that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else equal]], higher wages can deter corruption by increasing the value of behaving honestly. However, when bribes are high and punishment and the probability of detection are low, substantial increases in public official's wages may be required to preempt bribery. Another model explaining bureaucratic corruption, the fair-wage model, makes a distinction between need-based and greed-based corruption. According to this theory, public officials are not necessarily driven by greed but find corruption tempting when their salaries do not allow to meet subsistence levels. 'Fairness' is also determined by other factors, such as the salaries of peers within the civil service, private sector wages, social expectations and the status of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Ting|last2=Wu|first2=Alfred M.|date=2012-10-08|title=Does Increased Civil Service Pay Deter Corruption?: Evidence from China|ssrn=2158530|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of not being paid a fair wage increases corruptibility and also reduces the moral costs of corruption.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaus|first=Abbink|date=2000|title=Fair Salaries and the Moral Costs of Corruption|url=https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/78377|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model therefore suggests that even modest increases in salaries ensuring 'fair wages' can reduce civil servants' propensity to solicit and accept bribes.

The theoretical linkage between public salary increases and corruption remains ambiguous. In a context of constrained government fiscal resources, the question of [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] to design optimal wage policies arises. A cross-country study by Van Rijckeghem and Weder endeavours to find empirical support for the fair-wage and efficiency wage hypotheses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/Corruption-and-the-Rate-of-Temptation-Do-Low-Wages-in-the-Civil-Service-Cause-Corruption-2246|title=Corruption and the Rate of Temptation : Do Low Wages in the Civil Service Cause Corruption?|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that relative government wages are negatively and significantly correlated with measures of corruption but that eradicating corruption would necessitate unrealistic increases in relative wages.  These correlations, however, cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship going from public sector wages to corruption. Causality may run in the [[Reverse causation|reverse]] direction, pervasive corruption has been shown to reduce tax revenue collection and public expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|last2=Davoodi|first2=Hamid R.|date=2000-11-01|title=Corruption, Growth, and Public Finances|ssrn=880260|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor public finance performance and strong budgetary pressures due to corruption may in turn sustain low civil service salaries. This [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] problem complicates the understanding of the relationship between pay reforms and corruption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Klaus Abbink also tests the fair salary hypothesis in a laboratory experimental setting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The controlled environment in this experiment allows to isolate and identify the impact of 'fair income' considerations on corrupt behaviour. He finds that public officials in two treatments with different perceptions of 'fairness' behave similarly in a bribery game. In other words, high relative public officials salaries do not alter decisions to be corrupt through fairness considerations. These experimental results substantiate Van Rijckeghem and Weder's findings and cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness of increasing public salaries to combat corruption.

Di Tella and Schargrodsky provide additional evidence with their micro-empirical analysis on wages and [[audit]]ing during a crackdown on corruption in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 1996-97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Tella|first=Rafael|last2=Schargrodsky|first2=Ernesto|date=2003-04-01|title=The Role of Wages and Auditing during a Crackdown on Corruption in the City of Buenos Aires|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/345578|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that wage increases can be effective only when combined with intermediate levels of monitoring intensity (the probability of detection in the shirking model). They test their hypotheses using variations in audit intensity during the crackdown on corruption in public hospitals and find that procurement officers’ wages alone have no statistically significant effect on corruption but detect a negative relationship when wages are interacted with audit intensity. The authors make the case that higher wages and monitoring (“carrots and sticks”) should be used simultaneously to act as an effectual anti-corruption strategy.

The literature on public officials' salaries and corruption offers mixed or inconclusive evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/what-is-the-evidence-of-the-impact-of-increasing-salaries-on-improving-the-performance-of-public-servants-including-teachers-nurses-and-mid-level-occupations-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-is-it-time-to-give-pay-a-chance|title=What is the evidence of the impact of increasing salaries on improving the performance of public servants?  Is it time to give pay a chance? - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to indicate that pay increases is a necessary but insufficient condition for curbing corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iie.org:443/en/Research-and-Insights/Publications/DFG-NU-LitReviewPublication|title=Combatting Corruption Among Civil Servants (2017)|website=iie|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wage hikes could also have varying effects depending on whether reforms focus on base-salary (unconditional) increases or performance-related pay increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasnain|first=Zahid|last2=Manning|first2=Nick|last3=Pierskalla|first3=Jan Henryk|date=2012|title=Performance-related Pay in the Public Sector: A Review of Theory and Evidence|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6046|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Papers|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dissatisfaction with [[Centralisation|centralized]] forms of [[governance]], decentralization of public service provision to [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments became a global trend, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=1999|title=World Development Report 1999/2000|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decentralization]] is the transfer of [[authority]], resources and responsibilities from higher to lower levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/UNDP4/decentralization-and-power-shift-an-imperative-for-good-governance/index.html|title=Decentralization and Power Shift: An Imperative for Good Governance {{!}} UNDP|website=www.ombudsman.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Rao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/decentralisation-and-local-government/|title=Decentralisation and local government - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  distinguish three types of decentralization:

*[[Administration (government)|Administrative]] decentralization refers to the ability of [[local government]]s to hire, fire and set terms of reference for their own employees and on the human resource management and government organization framework.
*Under [[Politics|Political]] or [[Democracy|Democratic]] Decentralization, power is transferred to lower levels of government, public officials are elected by local citizens and are accountable to citizens rather than to the central government.
*[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] Decentralization involves assigning responsibilities for [[expenditures]] and [[revenue]]s to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/decentralization/fiscal.htm|title=Fiscal Decentralization|website=www1.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of fiscal decentralization varies according to local governments' ability to raise revenues and the extent to which they are given autonomy in allocating their expenditures.

Countries differ in their degree of administrative, political and fiscal decentralization. For instance, in [[China]] there is a devolution of administrative and fiscal responsibilities but no political decentralization whereas it is the opposite in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2006|title=Decentralization, Corruption and Government Accountability: An Overview|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/bos/iedwpr/dp-152.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theoretical arguments supporting that decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption. To begin with, decentralization is believed to bring the government closer to its citizens and to improve the allocation of resources at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azfar|first=O|last2=Kähkönen|first2=S|last3=Lanyi|first3=A|last4=Meagher|first4=P|last5=Rutherford|first5=Diana|date=2004-01-01|title=Decentralization, Governance and Public Services: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230557423|journal=Devolution and Development: Governance Prospects in Decentralizing States|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal output level of a local public good (at which citizens' [[Marginal utility|marginal benefit]] equals [[marginal cost]] of providing the good) varies across localities because of differences in preferences and costs. Considering that sub-national governments have better information about the preferences and circumstances of their constituencies, they can tailor the provision of public goods according to these preferences, thereby increasing efficiency and total welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oates|first=Wallace E|date=1999|title=An Essay on Fiscal Federalism|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1120–1149|doi=10.1257/jel.37.3.1120|issn=0022-0515|citeseerx=10.1.1.195.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea goes back to [[Friedrich Hayek|F. Hayek's]] argument in his essay "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945). Hayek asserts that since knowledge is decentralized ("the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayek|first=F. A.|date=1945|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society|jstor=1809376|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=35|issue=4|pages=519–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that decisions and control over resources should be decentralized (a necessary although not sufficient condition for achieving optimal allocation).

However, [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent models]] demonstrate there can be tradeoffs in transferring [[decision-making]] responsibilities. Under these theoretical frameworks, central public officials are assumed to be public-spirited principals and local officials act as self-interested agents. On the one hand, [[public good]] delivery can be better adapted to local needs but on the other hand, the decisions are made by [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] whose interests differ from the [[Principal–agent problem|principal]]. Delegating [[authority]] can result in 'control loss' or 'abuse of power'. Decentralization can be more effective than centralized decision-making if the gains from adaptability can outweigh the control loss. The overall effects of decentralization on governance and [[welfare]] will therefore depend on the degree to which the principal's and agent's interests are opposed and the principal's ability to exert control over the agent's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melumad|first=Nahum|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|last3=Reichelstein|first3=Stefan|date=1997-06-01|title=Contract Complexity, Incentives, and the Value of Delegation |journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=257–289|doi=10.1111/j.1430-9134.1997.00257.x|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that decentralization can enhance accountability in the service delivery mechanism. Local governments' proximity makes it more feasible for citizens to monitor and hold public officials accountable. The accountability mechanisms work through political decentralization. In a functional local democracy, local elections constitute an 'incomplete contract' enabling citizens to remove non-performing local officials from office.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, as Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, local democracy may not operate effectively in practice in developing countries and may be captured by local elites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2000|title=Corruption and Decentralization of Infrastructure Delivery in Developing Countries|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/bosecd/104.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, decentralization can reduce corruption by creating horizontal competition between local governments. [[Tiebout model|Tiebout]] make the case in a 1956 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout|first=Charles M.|date=1956-10-01|title=A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=64|issue=5|pages=416–424|doi=10.1086/257839|issn=0022-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; that residents' and factors of production's mobility across localities can reduce the monopoly power exercised by local public officials with respect to regulations and bribes. Fiscal and political decentralization encourages inter-jurisdictional competition that pressures sub-national governments to efficiently deliver local public goods. If citizens are dissatisfied with their local government's performance, they can move to other regions, thereby decreasing tax revenues in less efficient jurisdictions. A similar argument concerning the relationship between a decentralized bureaucratic structure and bribe payments has been explored in the academic literature. [[Susan Rose-Ackerman|Rose-Ackerman]] suggests that a decentralized civil service can reduce bribery since [[competition]] between public officials would bid down bribe payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVa0BQAAQBAJ|title=Corruption: A Study in Political Economy|last=Rose-Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2013-10-22|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483289069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishny and Shleifer further develop this argument, they build a model where citizens and businesses require more than one service or good from several public officials. If government services are substitutes, then the competitive regime still applies. However, when government services are complementary and in the case of a decentralized bureaucratic structure, firms or citizens are facing several independent bureaucrats. Decentralization might therefore lead to a lack of coordination among bribe-seeking bureaucrats and a "[[Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]" outcome where public officials ask bribe payments that are too high, thereby increasing the burden that corruption imposes on firms and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shleifer|first=A.|last2=Vishny|first2=R. W.|date=1993-08-01|title=Corruption|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/599/1881822?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=599–617|doi=10.2307/2118402|issn=0033-5533|jstor=2118402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaby and Sylwester empirically test these hypotheses in a cross-country regression and find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-09-01|title=Bureaucratic competition and public corruption: Evidence from transition countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268014000408|journal=European Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=35|pages=75–87|doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2014.04.002|issn=0176-2680|last1=Diaby|first1=Aboubacar|last2=Sylwester|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Fisman and Gatti detect a strong negative correlation between fiscal decentralization (as measured by subnational share of total government spending) and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Fisman|last2=Roberta|first2=Gatti|date=2000|title=Decentralization and Corruption : Evidence across Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/19852|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman (2000) examines correlations between eight different measures of decentralization with various measures of corruption and service delivery performance. The same measure of fiscal decentralization used by Fisman and Gatti appears not to be significantly correlated with corruption measures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000|title=Decentralization and the Quality of Government|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=2000|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decentralization is a complex process which manifests itself in various forms. The design and impetus for decentralization are specific to each country, which complicates comparisons of a single conception of decentralization. The literature on decentralization experiences in several developing countries suggests the effects of decentralization on public sector performance and corruption are likely to be ambiguous and highly context-specific.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The empirical work appears to be inconclusive as various types of decentralization were examined using different measures. What's more, measuring corruption as bribery without paying attention to special interest [[Elite capture|capture]] may provide an inaccurate assessment of the impact of decentralization. As Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, bribery may decrease while being replaced by local elite capture as a result of decentralization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Treisman purports that the theoretical and empirical arguments about decentralization and governance refer to specific types of decentralization. He identifies five types: structural, decision, resource, electoral and institutional decentralization and develops arguments clarifying how each type affects the quality of government.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While some types of decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption, others can undermine government performance, this can in part explain the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of decentralization.

=== Top-Down Performance Monitoring ===
Rather than structuring rewards and penalties for corrupt behaviour, another approach to civil service reform seeks to increase the probability that corrupt activity will be observed. Theoretically,  monitoring can reduce [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] so that the principal can induce the agent to choose the optimal level of effort and the optimal degree of corrupt activity. As the agent compares his expected payoff of being honest to that of being corrupt, increasing the probability of getting caught and punished will deter corrupt behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520074088|title=Controlling Corruption|last=Klitgaard|first=Robert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3: Policy Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil service auditing by the principal or third parties serves an [[accountability]] function. The inherent conflict of interest as well as the lack of oversight require independent third parties to certify the reliability of financial reporting, performance results and compliance to rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/leading-practices/Pages/the-role-of-auditing-in-public-sector-governance.aspx|title=The Role of Auditing in Public Sector Governance|last=|first=|date=|website=na.theiia.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors can help exercise oversight by evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/33Performanceauditing.pdf|title=Public Sector Performance Auditing in Developing Countries|last=Warring|first=Colleen|last2=Morgan|first2=Stephen|date=2009|website=|access-date=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[audit]]s must rely on efficiency measures and pre-determined criteria and benchmarks to assess public servant's performance and the impact of government's programs. Performance auditing can also help detect corruption in public entities. Audits highlight irregularities and areas of inefficiencies that may indicate the existence of corruption. Based on suspicious circumstances, auditors can identify illegal behaviour and collect evidence on misdeeds which can subsequently be used to prosecute public servants at fault. As previously mentioned, successful detection efforts by performance auditing can have a deterrent effect on corrupt activities.

Auditing and prosecution were important elements in Justice Plana's campaign to curb corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines. Appointed as the new Commissioner of the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue, Justice Plana's anti-corruption strategy focused on implementing a new performance evaluation system, gathering information on corruption through intelligence agents and audits and effectively prosecuting corrupt tax officers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While Justice Plana's campaign was a multi-faceted approach, the higher monitoring intensity combined with a highly credible threat of punishment were particularly successful in deterring corrupt behaviour in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. According to Professor Magtolis-Briones, the threat of being detected and prosecuted decidedly lead officials to reconsider their decisions to engage in corrupt activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph:8081/bitstream/handle/0/4711/07_Negative%20Bureaucratic%20Behavior%20and%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|title=Negative Bureaucratic Behaviour and Development:The Case of the Bureau of Internal Revenue|last=Magtolis-Briones|first=Leonor|date=1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, the success of anti-corruption reforms especially relied on top-down monitoring and prosecution but Schueth warns about the potential abuses of monitoring when fighting corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Apparatus of capture: Fiscal state formation in the republic of Georgia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811001880|journal=Political Geography|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.11.004|issn=0962-6298|last1=Schueth|first1=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crackdown on corruption in the tax agency involved coercion such as the use of extra-legal surveillance systems to ensure public officials' observance of the new procedural codes.

Laboratory experiments provide evidence on the impact monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|title=A controlled field experiment on corruption|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292111000389|journal=European Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1072–1082|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.007|issn=0014-2921|last1=Armantier|first1=Olivier|last2=Boly|first2=Amadou}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controlled bribery experiment in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Armantier and Boly observed that monitoring and punishment can be an effective anti-corruption policy. The researchers had two treatments, low monitoring and high monitoring.While the 'low monitoring' treatment proved effective in curbing bribery, they could not detect significant treatment effects on bribery in the 'high monitoring' treatment. The authors suggest that high monitoring intensity can crowd out intrinsic motivations to behave honestly.

Serra compare the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up monitoring in a laboratory bribery game between public officials and private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serra|first=D.|date=2011-06-09|title=Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up Accountability: Evidence from a Bribery Experiment|url=https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article-abstract/28/3/569/909949|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=569–587|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewr010|issn=8756-6222|citeseerx=10.1.1.594.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental results suggest that top-down auditing is ineffective in deterring bribery, this may be especially true in weak institutional environments. However, the researcher found that combining formal top-down auditing and bottom-up monitoring created an accountability mechanism that was effective in curbing corruption.

=== Bottom-Up Monitoring and Reforms ===
An alternative approach to improving governance and combating corruption that has gained prominence in recent years is encouraging grassroots participation by community members in local monitoring to induce bottom-up pressures for reform. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2003-09-30|title=World Development Report 2004 : Making services work for poor people - Overview|pages=1–36|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527371468166770790/World-Development-Report-2004-Making-services-work-for-poor-people-Overview|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is centred on this grassroots approach to development. Community participation is now considered an important component of reforms aiming to improve public service delivery and corruption at the local level.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Olken |first=Benjamin |title=Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=115 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 |citeseerx=10.1.1.144.6583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up models of governance involve community members participating in the service provision process by allowing them to monitor public officials, to have a say in policymaking, and keep service providers accountable to incentivize them to deliver public goods and services efficiently.

[[Joseph Stiglitz|J. Stiglitz]] argues that community members, as beneficiaries of public goods and services, will have more incentives to monitor and ensure that governments programs are successful compared to indifferent central bureaucrats. In particular, project involving local citizens will be more likely to succeed since community participation helps sustain efforts towards the long-term continuation of projects necessary to keep them effective.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|date=2002|title=Participation and Development: Perspectives from the Comprehensive Development Paradigm|journal=Review of Development Economics|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=163–182|doi=10.1111/1467-9361.00148|issn=1363-6669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Benjamin Olken|B. Olken]] contends that grassroots monitoring for public goods and services may be impaired by a free-rider problem&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; and suggests that government provision of private goods (subsidized food or health care) may generate more incentives to monitor service provision as each community member has a personal interest in securing the effective delivery of goods and in minimizing extortion by public officials. Stiglitz indeed recognizes that grassroots monitoring of public good delivery is in itself a public good and that as such, it is under-provided.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A bottom-up project, the Citizen Report Card (CRC), pioneered by the NGO [[Public Affairs Centre India|Public Affairs Center]] (PAC) was implemented in 1993 in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. This project aimed at gathering local citizens' feedback on civil service performance and publicizing the results through the media, thereby exerting public pressures for the public service to improve its performance and launch reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adikeshavalu|first=Ravindra|date=2004-06-01|title=An assessment of the impact of Bangalore citizen report cards on the performance of public agencies|pages=1–25|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/777451468752769088/An-assessment-of-the-impact-of-Bangalore-citizen-report-cards-on-the-performance-of-public-agencies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the report cards revealed low levels of citizens' satisfaction with service providers, and the expectation was that report cards would serve as an accountability mechanism that would bring forward issues of service provision quality and corruption levels in the public service. While this initiative did raise awareness on such issues, there was some but not dramatic improvement in service delivery quality between 1994 and 1999. However, the difficulty of measuring improvements in service quality other than through subjective measures restricts opportunities to rigorously evaluate this bottom-up initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01004/WEB/IMAGES/10850832.PDF|title=Making Voices: The Report Card on Bangalore's Public Services|last=Paul|first=Samuel|date=|website=|publisher=Public Affairs Center, Bangalore, India|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Participatory budgeting|Participatory Budgeting]] in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] is known among scholars and policymakers as an enduring example of bottom-up reforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Participatory-budgeting-of-Porto-Alegre:-a-in-the-Utzig/b8f09942a1c783728ff4a76e16a37deca2f11998|title=Participatory budgeting of Porto Alegre: a discussion in the light of the principle of democratic legitimacy and of the criterion of governance performance - Semantic Scholar|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting allows citizens to voice their demands regarding service delivery improvements, and through negotiations to influence budget funds allocation at the municipality level. This project was initiated in 1989, and is said to have improved access to and the quality of public service provision, especially for lower segments of society.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For instance, 27,000 new public housing units were created in 1989 (compared to only 1,700 in 1986), the number of schools quadrupled between 1986 and 1997 while the share of Porto Alegre's budget going to education and health went from 13% in 1985 to about 40% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf|title=Participatory Budgeting in Brazil|last=Bhatnagar et al.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting still has to address some limitations, including lack of representation of the poorest, but its success has led other municipalities in Brazil and public entities in other countries to adopt this initiative.

== Evidence on Reform Effectiveness in Developing Countries ==

=== Pay Reforms Experiences ===

==== Base Salary Increases for Police Officers in Ghana ====
In 2010, the Ghanaian government implemented a civil service salary reform, the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) to mitigate pay disparities in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=D.|first=Larbi, M.|title=The Implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure (Ssss) in Ghana|date=2007|degree=|publisher=University of Ghana|url=http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/8394|doi=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were the first beneficiaries of this new salary structure as the police service has historically been the least well-paid of public services in [[Ghana]]. Their wages unilaterally doubled in an attempt to increase their [[Standard of living|living standards]] to reduce [[bribery]] (fair-wage hypothesis). Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang assess the impact of this salary reform using a [[Difference in differences|difference-in-difference]] analysis taking advantage of the exogenous change induced by the policy.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

While police officers' wages doubled, the salaries of other civil servants in Ghana and police officers in [[Burkina Faso]] stayed the same. The researchers identified two groups, the Ghanaian policemen who received the treatment (higher wages) and the control group consisting of other civil servants (Ghanaian custom officers and Burkinabé policemen) whose wages did not increase.

Using data on bribes paid from 2,100 truck trips between Ghana and Burkina Faso,  Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang can observe the differences in interactions with truck drivers between the treated and the control group before the salary reform (2006-2010) and after the salary reform (2010-2012). If we assume group differences would have stayed constant in the absence of the reform ([[Difference in differences#Assumptions|parallel trend assumption]]), the difference-in-difference coefficient estimate measures the causal impact of the salary increase on Ghanaian police officers' propensity to ask for bribes. The results suggest that the salary reform counterintuively increased police officers' efforts to extort bribes, the value of the bribes and the total amount truck drivers had to pay on the road.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This evidence goes against theoretical arguments on pay reforms in the civil service. Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang posit that these results could be due to the lack of enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Without changing the environment and other incentives facing civil servants, it appears that increasing wages may not have the predicted effects on corruption.

==== Pay for Performance Reforms for Tax Collectors in Pakistan ====
Corruption in tax administration has particularly detrimental effects on tax revenue collection, fiscal balance and overall economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajaz|first=Tahseen|last2=Ahmad|first2=Eatzaz|date=2010|title=The Effect of Corruption and Governance on Tax Revenues|jstor=41428665|journal=The Pakistan Development Review|volume=49|issue=4|pages=405–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan, Khwaja and Olken implemented a large-scale randomized experiment in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] to assess the impact of performance-based payment schemes for tax collectors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Adnan Q. |last=Khan |first2=Asim I. |last2=Khwaja |first3=Benjamin A. |last3=Olken |year=2016 |title=Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=219–271 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjv042 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66265/1/Khan_Tax%20farming%20redux_2016.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Punjab provincial government, they randomly allocated tax officials in the provincial urban property tax department into four groups, a control group and three treatment groups corresponding to different pay-for-performance designs.

The three treatment groups differed in the degree to which tax officers' pay was based on revenue collection performance and on other subjective evaluations from taxpayers and the tax department. The 'Revenue' treatment provided incentives depending only on revenue collection exceeding a benchmark while the 'Revenue Plus' scheme tied salaries to tax collection performance as well as accuracy of tax assessment and taxpayers' satisfaction. The last treatment 'Flexible Plus' added several criteria set by the tax department to determine wages. After two fiscal years, Khan, Khwaja and Olken found that across the three treatment groups, tax revenues increased by 9 log points on average which is equivalent to 46% higher growth of revenues compared to the control group.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The 'Revenue' scheme was the most effective in increasing tax collection but the researchers found no effects on accuracy of tax assessment or the satisfaction of taxpayers. They note that pay-for-performance schemes may have tradeoffs: giving excessive incentives to tax officers might increase their bargaining power with taxpayers and lead to more extortion and taxpayers' dissatisfaction. However, Khan, Khwaja and Olken point out that the benefits of pay-for-performance contracts outweigh their costs and suggest they can effective in increasing tax revenue collection.

=== Monitoring Reforms ===

==== Random Audits in Brazilian Municipalities ====
In 2003, the federal government of Brazil created the [[Comptroller General of Brazil|Controladoria Geral da União]] (CGU) charged with corruption prevention and internal control. The CGU launched an anti-corruption program, Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), which consists in randomly selecting municipalities for audits and publicly disseminating the findings. As of 2015, 12 years after the beginning of the reform, there have been 2,241 audits in 1,949 municipalities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Avis |first=Eric |last2=Ferraz |first2=Claudio |last3=Finan |first3=Frederico |date=July 2016 |title=Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 22443 |doi=10.3386/w22443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Avis, Ferraz and Finan exploited the random selection to measure the impact of this anti-corruption program. While some municipalities had been audited several times in the past (treatment group), others were being audited for the first time (control group). Since the municipalities were randomly selected, comparing corruption levels among municipalities in the control and treatment group can provide causal estimates of the effects of the reform.

Based on audit reports, they estimate that 30% of the federal funds transferred to municipalities were stolen. However, they find that corruption levels were 8% lower in municipalities that had previously undergone government audits, thereby suggesting that random audits can be an effective policy against corruption. The researchers posit that random audits can reduce corruption by increasing public officials' perceived probability of being detected. They observed that audits also generated spillover effects, neighbouring municipalities were also affected, having an additional neighbour audited decreased their corruption levels by 7.5%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The local media played a role in disseminating information about other municipalities' audit outcomes.

Avis et al. identify several mechanisms through which the audits led to lower local corruption. First, the new program introduce a system of political accountability whereby local citizens can punish or reward (dis)honest incumbents. Audits may have also altered the types of candidates who enter into politics. What's more, negative audit results can generate reputational costs and potential legal punishments.

==== Monitoring a Road Building Project in Indonesia ====
The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) is an Indonesian government program, financed by the World Bank which funds village-level small-scale infrastructure programs. [[Benjamin Olken]] implemented a randomized experiment in which he randomly assigned 608 villages into groups with different audit probabilities prior to the start of a nationwide infrastructure project.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

A random sample of villages were informed that the project would be audited by an audit agency once completed. This increased the probability of detection from 4% to 100%. The audit results were publicly disseminated by the auditors during village meetings. Olken also designed experiments to increase local members' participation in 'accountability meetings' where officials in charge of the road-building project expose how the budget will be spent.

To assess the impact of both monitoring mechanisms, the researcher uses a quantitative measure of corruption levels based on engineers' assessment of the quantity of materials used to build the roads and estimated costs. The discrepancies between project’s official costs reported by village project leaders and the costs estimated by independent engineers measures missing expenditures which are used as a proxy for corruption in Olken's study. It was estimated that on average 24% of materials were missing based on road samples, suggesting that part of the project funds were diverted. Olken finds that increasing the probability of external audits significantly reduced missing expenditures (by 8%), and that this approach to fighting corruption is cost-effective.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Top-down audits were more effective when village elections were close, which implies that local level accountability can be effective in restraining corrupt behaviour. However, the interventions to increase grassroots participation did not have any significant effects on missing funds.

== Challenges and Barriers to Effective Civil Service Reforms ==
[[Political economy]] dynamics condition the success of civil service reforms. [[Douglass North|North]] et al. argue that some developing countries function as 'limited access orders' in which [[elite]]s exclude broad cross-sections of society to maintain an equilibrium that enables them to extracts rents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Wallis|first2=John Joseph|last3=Webb|first3=Steven B.|last4=Weingast|first4=Barry R.|date=2007-11-09|title=Limited Access Orders In The Developing World :A New Approach To The Problems Of Development|journal=Policy Research Working Papers|language=en|doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4359|issn=1813-9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such an equilibrium, political elites have no incentives to break down their patronage networks and introduce [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] recruitment reforms in the civil service as it would threaten their position and reduce their opportunities for [[rent-seeking]]. The [[Clientelism|clientelist]] system on the contrary can be a powerful mechanism through which elites maintain this 'limited access order'. Considerably depending on clientelist and [[patronage]] networks increases the costs of implementing public sector reforms. Elites will therefore be likely to oppose reforms as they stand to lose the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geddes|first=Barbara|date=1991|title=A Game Theoretic Model of Reform in Latin American Democracies|jstor=1963165|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=2|pages=371–392|doi=10.2307/1963165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, civil service reforms are costly to implement in the short-term while their benefits will be manifested and reaped in the future. Governments are thus unwilling to make such unappealing investment. The long-term nature of reforms and the reluctance to initiate, gather and maintain support for reforms prevent their implementation in the first place. In a background paper for the 2011 World Bank Development Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lant|first=Pritchett|last2=Frauke|first2=de Weijer|date=2011|title=Fragile States : Stuck in a Capability Trap?|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9109|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Weijer and Pritchett appraise that it would take about 20 years to witness improvements in the functional capability of the state. In almost every countries, this exceeds the average duration of a term of office, political incumbents would have no incentives to incur the costs to carry out reforms while the benefits will accrue to future incumbents.

In addition, bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change should not be overlooked. Bureaucrats may be disinclined to accept changes brought by civil service reforms. This is especially true in countries where bureaucrats depend on informal or illegal channels to complement their meager salaries.&lt;ref name=":142"/&gt;

Institutional structures or types of political regimes also matter for reform implementation and success. In a democratic regime, political incumbents may see it in their interests to initiate bureaucratic reforms if voters value and acknowledge the public benefits of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/corruption-and-government/domestic-conditions-for-reform/8B269276F411CD2BA57F1F87E534D02E|title=Domestic Conditions for Reform (Chapter 13) - Corruption and Government|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for civil service reforms remains weak in developing countries. Even if bureaucratic corruption is condemned across countries, the internal demand for anti-corruption reforms is undermined by a [[collective action problem]]. Indeed, Persson, Rohstein and Teorell argue that civil service reforms have failed as a result of their mischaracterization of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Anna|last2=Rothstein|first2=Bo|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2012-09-07|title=Why Anticorruption Reforms Fail-Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=449–471|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x|issn=0952-1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most approaches to civil service reform rely on principal-agent frameworks that assume that 'principled principals' are public-spirited and will always take on the task to fight corruption and improve bureaucratic performance. However, the authors contend that, in contexts where corruption is pervasive, actors will not necessarily respond to incentives aiming at altering their behaviour but instead behave based on the extent to which corruption is the expected behaviour in society.

The '''Colonial Secretary of Van Diemen's Land''' (later '''Colonial Secretary of Tasmania''') was the representative of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[Colonial Office]] in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (later [[Tasmania]]), and was usually appointed from Britain.
In 1884, the role was renamed Chief Secretary.

{{Short description|Dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power}}
:''Individual nation articles should be consulted on specific national responses to corruption.''

In general, '''corruption''' is a form of [[dishonesty]] or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Corruption can be illegal (or legal in a [[kleptocracy]]){{dubious|date=July 2018}} and dishonest, but in recent years can also can involve legal miss-conduct in many other countries and can have global reach in many cases. See [http://thelawdictionary.org/corruption/ Black's Law Dictionary] for legal definition. See also: [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf worldbank.org] paper noting that corruption "may involve collusion between parties typically both from the public and private sectors, and may be legal in many countries"&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption may include many activities including [[bribery]] and [[embezzlement]], though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf |title=Report|website=siteresources.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political corruption]] occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most  commonplace in [[kleptocracies]], [[oligarchies]], [[narco-state]]s and [[mafia]] states.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term [[anti-corruption]].

==Scales of corruption==

[[File:Niger, Niamey, anti-corruption billboard.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An anti-corruption billboard at the entry into [[Niamey]], capital of [[Niger]].

Stephen D. Morris,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of politics, writes that [[Politics|politic]]al corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior&lt;ref&gt;Senior, I. (2006), Corruption – The World’s Big C., Institute of Economic Affairs, London&lt;/ref&gt; defines corruption as an action to (a) secretly provide (b) a good or a service to a third party (c) so that he or she can influence certain actions which (d) benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both (e) in which the corrupt agent has authority. [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]],&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|title=Legal Corruption|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro|year=2005|publisher=World Bank|format=PDF|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|author-link1=Daniel Kaufmann (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the World Bank, extends the concept to include 'legal corruption' in which power is abused within the confines of the law—as those with power often have the ability to make laws for their protection. The effect of corruption in infrastructure is to increase costs and construction time, lower the quality and decrease the benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Mariani|first2=Giacomo|last3=Sainati|first3=Tristano|last4=Greco|first4=Marco|date=2017-04-01|title=Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room!|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=35|issue=3|pages=252–268|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research work on social corruption developed at [[The Unicist Research Institute]] defines that corruption allows individuals to profit from the environment through illegitimate actions while they disintegrate the system they are part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Peter Belohlavek | title = Social Corruption and Corruption Inhibitors as a Complex Adaptive System | publisher =SSRN | date = June 2017 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.3066116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.

Increasingly, a number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf|title=Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petty corruption===
'''Petty corruption''' occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishler v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1993/22397-1.html|website=Justia Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf|title=Report|website=supremecourt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other private and government sectors.

===Grand corruption===
'''Grand corruption''' is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/NGO/Grand_Corruption_definition_with_explanation_19_August_2016_002_1.pdf|title=Material on Grand corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, [[Executive (government)|executive]] and judiciary branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|title=Political And Judicial Checks On Corruption: Evidence From American State Governments|last=Alt|first=James|date=|website=Projects at Harvard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203043655/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic corruption===
'''Systemic corruption''' (or endemic corruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest|conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-931003-11-7 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific acts of corruption include "bribery, extortion, and embezzlement" in a system where "corruption becomes the rule rather than the exception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Znoj|first=Heinzpeter|editor=Monique Nuijten, Gerhard Anders|title=Corruption and the secret of law: a legal anthropological perspective|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P52bOZFExesC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7682-9|pages=53–54|chapter=Deep Corruption in Indonesia: Discourses, Practices, Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars distinguish between centralized and decentralized systemic corruption, depending on which level of state or government corruption takes place; in countries such as the [[Post-Soviet states]] both types occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legvold|first=Robert|editor=Robert I.

Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty{{clarify|reason=change wording. Does this mean Western governments should NOT protect... in order that the undeveloped country develop its own? Or that it should stop corruption?|date=February 2015}} of western governments to protect against systematic corruption of underdeveloped governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Merle|editor1-first=Jean-Christophe|title=Global Challenges to Liberal Democracy|journal=Spheres of Global Justice|date=2013|volume=1|page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|website=thomaspogge.com|accessdate=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211060650/http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption in different sectors==
Corruption can occur in any sector, whether they be public or private industry or even [[NGOs]] (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.

===Government/public sector===
{{anchor|Government/Public corruption}}

Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|year=2013|title=Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|format=PDF|website= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/pubs/article/article.asp |title=SOS, Missouri – State Archives Publications |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf |format=PDF|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|website= Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

[[File:"Golden toilet" in ((Kaunas)), ((Lithuania)).png|thumb|250px|right|The Kaunas "golden toilet".]]

The '''[[Corruption in Lithuania#Kaunas golden toilet case|Kaunas golden toilet case]]''' was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor [[Andrius Kupčinskas]]) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500'000 [[litas]] (around 150'000 euros). It was to also require 5'000 LTL (1'500 EUR) in monthly maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="archive.org5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/auksinis-tualetas-per-menesi-atsieis-5-tukst-lt.d?id=59903123|title="Auksinis" tualetas per mėnesį atsieis 5 tūkst.

Despite the investment, the "golden toilet" remained closed for years due to the dysfunctionality and was a subject of a lengthy anti-corruption investigation into those who had created it and &lt;ref name="archive.org5"/&gt; the local municipality even considered demolishing the building at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|title=Alfa.lt – Kauno apskrities viršininko administracija kreipėsi į teismą dėl "auksinio" tualeto griovimo|date=18 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118124213/https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|archivedate=18 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of public servants involved in the toilet's procurement received various prison sentences for recklessness, malfeasance, misuse of power and document falsifications in a 2012 court case, but were cleared of their corruption charges and received compensation, which pushed the total construction cost and subsequent related financial losses to 352'000 euros.

Various sources acclaim the [[People's Party (Spain)|Spanish People's Party]] – Partido Popular -, to be Europe's most corrupt party, with about yearly 45 billion euro worth of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lasemaineduroussillon.com/2017/09/22/plus-de-45-milliards-de-de-corruption-annuelle-rajoy-a-tete-parti-politique-plus-corrompu-deurope/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police corruption====
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the thin blue line itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.

Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].

====Judicial corruption====
Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related [[judicial misconduct|misconduct of judges]], through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct.

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the [[constitutional economics]].

It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state.

===Corruption in the education system===
{{anchor|Educational system/Universities}}
Corruption in education is a worldwide phenomenon. Corruption in admissions to universities is traditionally considered as one of the most corrupt areas of the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat.

===Within labor unions===
The Teamsters ([[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]) is an example of how the civil [[RICO]] process can be used. For decades, the Teamsters have been substantially controlled by [[La Cosa Nostra]]. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI – Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524172413/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=2014-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in religion===
{{wikiquote|Corruption in religion}}
The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets [[Isaiah]] and [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] berate the rabbinical establishment of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Judea]] for failing to live up to the ideals of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah]] 1:2–31, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] 5:21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 23:13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] accuses the [[Catholic Church]] of widespread corruption, including selling of [[w:Indulgence|indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]] advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including [[James W. Fifield Jr.]], to develop and promote a new [[hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the [[social Gospel]] and emphasize themes, such as [[individual salvation]], more congenial to [[free enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to "[[w:Merchandising|merchandise]]" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as [[w:James W. Fifield Jr.#Spiritual Mobilization|Spiritual Mobilization]], the prayer breakfast groups, and the [[w:Freedoms Foundation|Freedoms Foundation]], they had linked [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in philosophy===
19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] acknowledges that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguishes the corrupt "university" philosophers, whose "real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public"&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “On Philosophy in the Universities,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth.

::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[criminology]], '''[[corporate crime]]''' refers to crimes committed either by a [[corporation]] (i.e., a [[business entity]] having a separate legal personality from the [[natural person]]s that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]] and [[corporate liability]]). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow [[insider trading]].

The country is regarded poorly and that corruption is wounding the economy badly despite the emerging oil industries wealth.&lt;ref name="trans257"/&gt;

The '''[[Mitterrand–Pasqua affair]]''', also known informally as '''[[Angolagate]]''', was an international [[political scandal]] over the secret and illegal sale and shipment of arms from the nations of [[Central Europe]] to the government of [[Angola]] by the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] in the 1990s. It led to arrests and judiciary actions in the 2000s, involved an illegal arms sale to Angola despite a [[United Nations|UN]] embargo, with business interests in [[France]] and elsewhere improperly obtaining a share of Angolan oil revenues. The scandal has subsequently been tied to several prominent figures in French politics.&lt;ref name=trans257/&gt;

==Methods==
In [[systemic corruption]] and [[grand corruption]], multiple methods of corruption are used concurrently with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Handbook on Practical Anti-Corruption Measures For Prosecutors and Investigators |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/corruption/publications_handbook_prosecutors.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery===
{{main|Bribery}}
Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is the common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.

===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===
{{main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.

Examples include the misdirection of company funds into "shadow companies" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.

===Graft===
{{main|Graft (politics)}}
The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

===Extortion and blackmail===
{{main|Extortion}}
While [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.

This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.

===Influence peddling===
[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in return for payment.

===Networking===
{{main|Business networking}}
Networking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of discretion===
{{main|Abuse of discretion}}
[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port.

===Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism===
{{main|Nepotism}}
[[Cronyism|Favouritism]], [[nepotism]] and [[clientelism]] involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/government-ethics/resources/what-is-government-ethics/favoritism-cronyism-and-nepotism/|title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism|last=|first=|date=|work=Santa Clara|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Corruption and economic growth ==
Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. ''Journal of Comparative Economics, 29'', 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Causes of corruption ==
According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimant|first=Eugen|last2=Tosato|first2=Guglielmo|date=2017-01-01|title=Causes and Effects of Corruption: What Has Past Decade's Empirical Research Taught Us? a Survey|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=32|issue=2|language=en|pages=335–356|doi=10.1111/joes.12198|issn=1467-6419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing corruption ===
[[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Klitgaard|Klitgaard, Robert]] (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted:

Corrupt gain &gt; Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted

The degree of corruption will then be a function of the degree of [[monopoly]] and discretion in deciding who should get how much on the one hand and the degree to which this activity is accountable and transparent on the other hand. Still, these equations (which should be understood in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner) seem to be lacking one aspect: a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption without any moral weakness or insufficient integrity. Also, low penalties in combination with a low probability of being caught will only lead to corruption if people tend to neglect ethics and moral commitment. The original R.Klitgaard equation has therefore been amended by C. Stephan&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, {{ISBN|978-3-86582-452-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; into:

According to Stephan, the moral dimension has an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. The intrinsic component refers to a mentality problem, the extrinsic component to external circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for "alternative" solutions.

According to the amended Klitgaard equation, limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|last=|first=|doi = 10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917|year = 2012|last1 = Olken|first1 = Benjamin A|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|hdl=1721.1/73081}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently addressed the important role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians’ income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.

===Enhancing Civil Society Participation ===
Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. The implementation of the ALACs “Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” has led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the [[OECD]]. There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].

As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore "...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|format=PDF|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then "OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33–69|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a document&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F. April 2013, Existing practices on anti-corruption, Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services helpdesk request |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found:
* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.
* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.
* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.
* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.
* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.
* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm’s productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

== Corruption tourism ==

In some countries people travel to corruption hot spots or a specialist tour company takes them on corruption city tours, as it is the case in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303360504577408381452443206|title=Czech Republic Has Its Answer to the Beverly Hills Star Tour|last=Carney|first=Gordon Fairclough And Sean|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/meet-strangest-startup-travel-corrupttour-162581/|title=Meet the strangest startup in travel: CorruptTour {{!}} CNN Travel|website=travel.cnn.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/world/europe/on-the-crony-safari-a-tour-of-a-citys-corruption.html|title=On the Crony Safari, a Tour of a City’s Corruption|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|date=2013-08-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27390314|title=Corruption redefined as tourism in Czech Republic – BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption tours have also occurred in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-corruption-tour-idUSKCN0XU17Q|title=So much corruption, stuffed into one Chicago tour|date=2017-05-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/tour-bus-offers-sightseeing-emblematic-corruption-spots-mexico-city|title=Tour Bus Offers Sightseeing of Emblematic Corruption Spots in Mexico City|last=Político*|first=Animal|website=www.insightcrime.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21717980-corruptour-has-its-own-take-capitals-monuments-using-tourism-teach-mexicans-about|title=Using tourism to teach Mexicans about corruption|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal corruption==
Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, there is an evolving concept of legal corruption,&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website= Economics and Politics, v23 |pages= 195–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=May 2014}} as developed by [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] and Pedro Vicente.  It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website=Economics and Politics, v23|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of legal corruption ===
In 1977 the USA had enacted the ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/|title=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|website=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for the purpose of making it unlawful... to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business" and invited all OECD countries to follow suit. In 1997 a corresponding [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was signed by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf |title=Report |website= oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/2406452.pdf|title= Report |website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17 years after the FCPA enacting, a Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on legal corruption in industrialized OECD countries&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drucksache 12/8468|website= Bonn Parliament records|date=September 8, 1994|pages= 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they reported that in most industrial countries even at that time (1994) foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices had been diverging to a large extent, ranging from simple legalization, through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extremes like in Germany where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.
Consequently, in order to support national export corporations the Parliamentary Financial Commission recommended to reject a related previous Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition leader which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US FCPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] "Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste."&lt;/ref&gt;
Only after the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into force, did Germany withdraw the legalization of foreign corruption in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study====
The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).&lt;ref name=study /&gt;

Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:
* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition
* They must be common in the industry
* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year
* Payments must be appropriate
* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).
In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.

Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.

France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered "rémunérations occult" and are associated with the following disadvantages:
* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.
* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the "rémunérations occult" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.
* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.

Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.

Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.

Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.

Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.

Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.

Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.

US: (rough résumé: "generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA")

UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient."

===="Specific" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====
Referring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,&lt;ref name=study /&gt; the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions&lt;ref&gt;the term "official" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no "officials". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQYc-dAIF0MC&amp;pg=PA109 für Rolf Keller"] Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: "Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u.&amp;nbsp;a. eine Person, die &gt;&gt;nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst."&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until March 19, 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/1952622.pdf|title=OECD: Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Britta Bannenberg, ''Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle'', page VII (Introduction): "Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können."&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf "Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German_Shadow_Economy.png|thumb|Development of the shadow economy in [[Germany|(West-) Germany 1975–2015]]. Original [[shadow economy]] data from Friedrich Schneider, University Linz.]]
Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS)&lt;ref name=blackaccounts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#67|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of the [[European Single Market]] in the upcoming [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]].
Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International: [http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/ach_das_mit_der_prostitution "Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden."]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/20063/umfrage/entwicklung-des-umfangs-der-schattenwirtschaft-seit-1995|title= Schattenwirtschaft – Umfang in Deutschland bis 2015 – Statistik|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Siemens corruption case ===
In 2007, [[Siemens]] was convicted in the District Court of [[Darmstadt]] of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation [[Enel Green Power|Enel Power SpA]]. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through [[black money]] accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] that were established specifically for such purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? – hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. According to Bucerius Law School professors Frank Saliger and Karsten Gaede, for the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like national ones although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#62|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the judicial proceedings however it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.&lt;ref name=blackaccounts /&gt;

== Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought ==
Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. [[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers "shelter behind a wall" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.

''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d&lt;/ref&gt;''

The [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ [[wikt:κόσμος|κόσμος]])&lt;ref&gt;2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit "unspotted from the world."&lt;ref&gt;James 1:27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably "deal with the world,"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:31.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends they adopt an attitude of "as if not" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it "as if it were not theirs to keep."&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:30.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to refuse to "conform to the present age"&lt;ref&gt;Romans 12:2.&lt;/ref&gt; and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because "friendship with the world is enmity with God."&lt;ref&gt;James 4:4.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.&lt;ref&gt;1 John 2:15.&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of this world, Paul explains, "are coming to nothing"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 2:6.&lt;/ref&gt; While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:1.&lt;/ref&gt; the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:8.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are "in the world, but not of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, ''In the World But Not Of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (2000), See also John 15:19.&lt;/ref&gt; This disposition, Paul claims, shows us a way to escape "slavery to corruption" and experience the freedom and glory of being innocent "children of God".&lt;ref&gt;Roman 8:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Countercurrent''' ({{lang-it|Controcorrente}}) is a small, Italian, [[trotskyism|trotskyist]] political party. It used to be a faction within the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

The group emerged in 2006 as a split from [[Communist Project]], when their leader [[Marco Ferrando]] decided to leave the party in order to form his own [[Workers' Communist Party (Italy)|Workers' Communist Party]]. For the 24–27 July 2008 congress the faction formed a common list with [[The Ernesto]], another minority faction, and obtained 7.7% of the delegates. In that occasion they supported the election of [[Paolo Ferrero]], leader of the [[Refoundation in Movement]]-[[Being Communists]] motion, as party secretary, thus joining for the first time the majority of the party.

In 2010 the faction embraced the [[Committee for a Workers' International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/4285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the party was the most important promoter of the massive Genoa Public Transportation Strike, that went on for a week and was considered the biggest non-general strike of the year.

In 2017, Controcorrente left the CWI over disagreements regarding, among other issues, the role of the European Union and [[Brexit]]. A large minority including mostly younger members split from Controcorrente to remain part of the CWI, forming a new organisation named [[Resistenze Internazionali]].&lt;ref&gt;https://resistenzeinternazionali.it/2017/08/un-inizio-cwi-cil-italia/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haagse-magistraat.jpg|thumb|The city council of [[The Hague]] deliberating in 1636.]]
'''Deliberation''' is a process of thoughtfully weighing options, usually prior to [[voting]]. Deliberation emphasizes the use of [[logic]] and [[reason]] as opposed to power-struggle, creativity, or [[dialog]]. [[Group decision-making|Group decisions]] are generally made after deliberation through a vote or [[consensus]] of those involved.

In legal settings a jury famously uses deliberation because it is given specific options, like guilty or not guilty, along with information and arguments to evaluate.  In "[[deliberative democracy]]", the aim is for both elected officials and the general public to use deliberation rather than power-struggle as the basis for their vote.

==Trial juries==
[[File:Oil Pastels and ink drawing of jurors consisting of six African American women, one white woman and one white man. 20.jpg|thumb|A jury.]]
In countries with a [[jury]] system, the jury's deliberation in criminal matters can involve both rendering a [[verdict]] and determining the appropriate [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. In civil cases, the [[Judgment (law)|jury decision]] is whether to agree with the [[plaintiff]] or the [[defendant]] and rendering a [[Legal remedy|resolution]] binding actions by the parties based on the results of the trial.

Typically, a jury must come to a unanimous decision before delivering a [[verdict]]; however, there are exceptions.  When a unanimous decision is not reached and the jury feels that one is not possible, they declare themselves a '[[hung jury]]', a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] is declared and the trial will have to be redone at the discretion of the plaintiff or [[prosecutor]].

One of the most famous dramatic depictions of this phase of a trial in practice is the [[film]], ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]''.

==In political philosophy==
[[File:Shimer assembly applause.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] Assembly deliberation.]]

In [[political philosophy]], there is a wide range of views regarding how deliberation becomes a possibility within particular governmental regimes. Most recently, the uptake of deliberation by political philosophy embraces it alternatively as a crucial component or the death-knell of democratic systems. Much of contemporary democratic theory juxtaposes an optimism about democracy against excessively hegemonic, fascist, or otherwise authoritar regimes. Thus, the position of deliberation is highly contested and is defined variously by different camps within contemporary political philosophy. In its most general (and therefore, most ambiguous) sense, deliberation describes a process of interaction between various subjects/subjectivities dictated by a particular set of norms, rules, or fixed boundaries.

The origins of philosophical interest in deliberation can be traced to Aristotle’s concept of ''phronesis'', understood as “prudence” or “practical wisdom” and its exercise by individuals who deliberate in order to discern the positive or negative consequences of potential actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nicomachean Ethics|last=Aristotle|first=|last2=Barnes|first2=Jonathan|date=2004-03-30|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=|isbn=9780140449495|editor-last=Tredennick|editor-first=Hugh|edition=1|location=|pages=209|language=English|translator-last=Thomson|translator-first=J. A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many contemporary political philosophers, the rigidity of a particular set of norms, rules, or fixed boundaries about either the way that subjects who would qualify for deliberation are constituted (a position perhaps epitomized by [[John Rawls]]) or regarding the kinds of argument which qualify as deliberation (a position perhaps epitomized by [[Jürgen Habermas]]) constitute a foreclosure of deliberation, making it impossible.

"Existential deliberation"  is a term coined by the theorists of the emotional public sphere.  Existential deliberation theorists contend that deliberation is an ontological state, rather than a process that can be deployed.  As such, deliberation is a rare thing that only might happen in face-to-face encounters.  This utilizes the insights of radical deliberation, in that the political is a rare discharge of potential into an otherwise sterile social field.

"Pragmatic deliberation" is the epistemic variant on existential deliberation, frequently focusing on the ways in which groups could be assisted with producing positive outcomes that both aggregate and transform the views of effected publics.

Advocates of “public deliberation” as an essential democratic practice focus on processes of inclusiveness and interaction in making political decisions. The validity and reliability of public opinion improves with the development of “public judgment” as citizens consider multiple perspectives, weigh possible options, and accept the outcomes of decisions made together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coming to Public Judgment: Making Democracy Work in a Complex World|last=Yankelovich|first=Daniel|date=1991-05-01|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815602545|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical deliberation===

Radical deliberation refers to a philosophical view of deliberation inspired by the events of the student revolution in May 1968. Political theory concerned with radical democracy, particularly that of such theorists as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], Chantal Mouffe, [[Jacques Ranciere]], and [[Alain Badiou]] also focus upon deliberation insofar as the process of engagement between disparate positions create the conditions of possibility for a politics. Notably for these thinkers, the task of radical democracy is always and already unfinalized, subject to a series of changes which occur outside of the conscious influence of any single actor and are instead the discursive effects of the contingent assemblies of larger bodies politic.

Michel Foucault's use of 'technologies of discourse' and 'mechanisms of power' describes how deliberation is either foreclosed or is a product of a series of technologies of discourse which produce a semblance of agency through the reproductions of power as they occur between individual subjects. The account of  'mechanisms' or 'technologies' is in some sense paradoxical: on the one hand, these technologies are inseparable from the subjects which enunciate them. On the other, to speak of the machine or technology which coordinates suggests an infrastructure through which the social is collectively organized, which suggests the removal of subjects from the means of their organization: a god's eye view of the social that is only coordinated by the movement of the parts.

[[Chantal Mouffe]] uses 'the democratic paradox' to generate a self-sustaining model of politics which is built on foundational contradictions - the non-resolution of which produces a productive agonism between subjects who recognize the other's right to speak. For Mouffe, the fact of the configuration of the social is the only foundational political stability - that and the certainty of a penultimate articulation's deferral. That is to say: re-articulations of the social will always occur. Again, process overwhelms content: the paradox of liberalism and popular sovereignty is the generative motor of radical democracy.  The rhetorical gesture of the foundational paradox becomes a mechanism; an interface between the human and a language machine which produces the conditions of possibility for continued reconfiguration: a [[positive feedback]] loop for politics.

Although Chantal Mouffe and Jacques Ranciere differ in their stance on what the conditions of the political are (for Mouffe, this is an internal reorganization of existing social arrangements in what are called 'articulations), for Ranciere, it is the incursion of an externality which had not yet been accounted for. In the 'arithmatic/geometric' distinctions of politics, there is a(n) (near) explicit appeal to the mechanical or mathematical: the political sustains itself by perpetuating a dialectic between homeostasis and reconfiguration (what [[N. Katherine Hayles]] might call 'pattern' and 'randomness') through a 'count' of what is internal to the police order. The mechanism of politics makes it possible for future reconfigurations only by making new inclusions, thereby rearranging the social, returning to homeostasis, and perpetuating the impossibility of a complete 'whole'. It is again a kind of rhetorical paradox which is the motor of politics: a foundational arbitrariness in who is or who is not permitted to speak.

==Deliberation theory==

Deliberation theory is a non-political and non-legal subject dealing with the technical aspects of making decisions with varying amounts of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1420067187|url=https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Algorithmic-Perspective-Recognition/dp/1420067184/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403385347&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywod|year=2009|page=140|title=Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman &amp; Hall/Crc Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition) - 1st Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Douglas-Grumman Scandal''' was a bribery scandal that rocked Japan in February 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Ezra F.|last2=Yuan|first2=Ming|last3=Tanaka|first3=Akihiko|title=The Golden Age of the U.S.-China-Japan Triangle, 1972–1989|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|isbn=9780674009608|page=55|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=oupsPZG1S2IC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Douglas+Grumman+scandal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=miAb-6NBsC&amp;sig=t8z6LtedrNfgaH_EbnfzwsFRfJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj35pbP2ZLWAhUGfFAKHY4wAPsQ6AEITjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglas%20Grumman%20scandal&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, concerning the sale of American fighter jets.

== History ==
; 1968
: Japan's [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] was considering various candidates for the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Air SDF]]'s new fighter jet, including the [[List of Lockheed F-104 Starfighter variants|Lockheed CL1010-2]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell-Douglas F-4]], [[Saab 37 Viggen]] and [[Dassault Mirage F1]]. However, in practice the CL-1010-2 was still under development, and the probability of using European jets was low due to the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan security treaty]], so there were few real contenders other than the F-4.

; 1969 
: It was decided to use the F-4EJ, based on the F-4E (normally it would have been called the F-4J, in keeping with the F-104J and F-15J that had also been modified for Japan, but there was already an F-4J in the US Navy). The differences from the F-4E, due to pressure from the Japan Socialist Party, were the removal of key apparatus such as the nuclear bomb pre-flight controller (DCU-9/A), weapons release computer (ASQ-91), [[AGM-12 Bullpup|Bullpup]] air-to-ground missile controller (ARW-77) and aerial refuelling equipment.

; 1972
:At the US-Japan meetings in Hawaii, President [[Richard Nixon]] persuaded Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] to buy the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C]].

; 1978
:25 December – The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) accuses [[McDonnell-Douglas]] of paying Japanese government officials US$15,000 in 1975 as bribes to buy their aircraft.

; 1979
:4 January – The SEC accuses [[Grumman]] of paying various Japanese government officials ([[Nobusuke Kishi]], [[Takeo Fukuda]], [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[Raizo Matsuno|Raizō Matsuno]] and others) bribes via [[Sojitz|Nisshō Iwai (now Sojitz]]) to buy their E-2C aircraft. [[Tokyo District Court]] also commences an investigation, requesting information from the SEC.
:30 January – The [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] Lockheed Investigation Special Committee is renamed the "Special Committee to Investigate Aircraft Imports", with a remit to investigate all allegations concerning aircraft sales.
:1 February – [[Mitsutaka Shimada]], the Nisshō Iwai executive in charge of the aircraft department, dies by falling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott-stokes|first1=Henry|title=Japanese Kills Himself in Plane Scandal Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/japanese-kills-himself-in-plane-scandal-case-japanese-takes-life-in.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; from its head office building in [[Akasaka, Tokyo]], leaving various suicide notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=島田三敬|url=http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=14 January 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114195842/http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/kuhiwo/dazai/shimada.html|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary at the time questions whether it was really suicide, on the basis it would be impossible to climb a high window after stabbing one's heart, and a book by journalist [[Kōichirō Yoshihara]] also alleges, with medical evidence, that it was in fact murder. The main 'suicide' note included the words "The company's life is eternal... we should serve it for eternity." The death of a key person causes the investigation to stall.
:14 February – The House of Representatives Budget Committee questions Nissho Iwai's Vice President [[Hachirō Kaifu]] (no relation to the later Prime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]]), President [[Mitsuo Ueda]], and former aircraft division manager [[Kunio Arimori]], live on TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Shoko’ testimony goes live on TV|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1999/12/14/national/shoko-testimony-goes-live-on-tv/#.WbFd6XCrL4E|accessdate=7 September 2017|work=The Japan Times Online|date=14 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kaifu appeared unable to sign his statement as his hand was trembling too much&lt;ref name="Welfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welfield|first1=John|title=An Empire in Eclipse: Japan in the Post-war American Alliance System: A Study in the Interraction of Domestic Politics and Foreign Policy|date=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780939957|pages=440-441|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=U6sVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;dq=arimori+kunio+%22Nissho+Iwai%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WzHHDctXF0&amp;sig=b6zaBojbxe83c8TuK7FgrzXhpUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPbmnZPWAhWF1RQKHcAEBkkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arimori%20kunio%20%22Nissho%20Iwai%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he later claimed was due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Kaifu repeatedly said "I cannot remember", rejecting the bribery allegations, but confirmed that he had talks with former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka at around the time of the 1972 US-Japan Hawaii meetings, and Matsuno at around the time of the change to Grumman's agent ([[Itochu|Itōchū Corporation]], known at the time as C. Itoh &amp; Co.). He refused to confirm he had hand-written the "Kaifu memo" which was one focus of the questions. Kaifu was also questioned about his relationship with [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] parliamentarian [[Rokusuke Tanaka]], and claimed in the National Assembly that he had had no contact.
:14 March – Nisshō Iwai's Air Department manager and deputy manager are arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. These individuals had had no interactions with politicians, but are later found guilty of 'falsification and exercise of a private document'. The deputy manager claims that he was not involved, and was targeted by the prosecutors due to being Shimada's top manager in charge of military aircraft, while the counterfeit document had in fact been substantially created by his predecessor and the accounts department manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivis.co.jp/saloon/4_Imamura/01_bibrio/Imamu-01-6.html IVIS HomePage 私の風土記]&lt;/ref&gt;
:19 March – Kaifu is questioned by the [[House of Councillors]] Budget Committee, and denies writing the "Kaifu memo". On 4 April he is accused of [[perjury]] on this point.
:22 March – Nisshō Iwai's former Vice President [[Kenjirō Yamamura]] and Executive Director [[Kiyoshi Inoue]] give evidence contradicting Kaifu at the Budget Committee. Yamamura testifies with regard to Kaifu's testimony at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that he was "confused".
:31 March – Due to the conflicting evidence from Kaifu and Yamamura, the House of Councilors Budget Committee summons Kaifu, former chairman [[Yoshio Tsuji]], and [[Yasuhiro Gō]], former economic adviser to McDonnell-Douglas. Kaifu amends key parts of his testimony on the 19th, but notably keeps his attitude that responsibility lay with the late Shimada.
:2 April – Kaifu is arrested on suspicion of Foreign Exchange Act violations. When the House of Councilors budget committee hear of his arrest that day, [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] Criminal Bureau Head (later [[Attorney General]]) [[Shigeki Itō]] comments that '''The purpose of the investigation is not only to find small evils but also not to overlook greater evils. If the crime is at the top, we must understand and identify it thoroughly.''' suggesting that the scandal might spread to the centre of the political world. Itō's words '''Do not overlook greater evils''' and (later, in his response to a special committee meeting of the upper house on 25 May) '''500&amp;nbsp;million yen for starters''' become buzzwords of the year.
:16 April – The Attorney General, in overall charge of the investigation, changes from [[Hisao Kamiya]] (retiring due to age) to [[Tatsusaburō Tsuji]]. In his final press conference, Kamiya says '''The prosecutors still have plenty of ability to investigate – I am leaving midway, but am happy to sense their strength of intention'''.
:24 April – Kaifu is rearrested on suspicion of perjury in the House of Representatives.
:26 April – The Diet opposition parties collectively demand that Kishi, Matsuno and others be questioned about their involvement. The LDP refuses, and the National Assembly is left in limbo.
:9 May – Itō suggests at the Legal Committee of the House of Representatives that the names "Fukuda" and "Matsuno" in the memo are unrelated to LDP representatives of the same names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/syugiin/087/0080/08705090080012a.html 87th House of Representatives Legal Committee No. 12], Proceedings of Wednesday, 9 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt;.
:15 May – A 'Prosecutors' Summit Meeting' confirms that "Pursuit of politicians' criminal liability will be abandoned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Roy|title=Japan: The Blighted Blossom|date=1989|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781850431251|page=54|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Cbs1r8gHR4IC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Douglas+Grumman+scandal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=txVdZ7ahjz&amp;sig=v7-aoKbS-S7RWZH-_ObZzaSD6KQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8r_f61JPWAhVEbVAKHTgEAJg4ChDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglas%20Grumman%20scandal&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the [[statute of limitations]] and restrictions on our authority", thus ending the Douglas-Grumman scandal investigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

Entrepreneurial leadership is effectively using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation.{{cn|date=July 2017}} This especially means within an organisation where those skills have been lost{{cn|date=July 2017}} and replaced with a [[corporation | "corporate"]] mindset that focuses on [[business process | process]], [[system]]s and risk minimisation rather than on entrepreneurial behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions and theories==
Other definitions of entrepreneurial leadership have also emerged:

An entrepreneurial leader will proactively identify opportunities to gain advantage through creativity, innovation and market understanding and then hoion and the customer.&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/media/tv-and-radio-interviews/1299-2/&lt;/ref&gt;j

==Attributes of an entrepreneurial leader==
The [https://www.eship.ox.ac.uk/what-does-it-mean-be-entrepreneurial entrepreneurial] leader will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, they work towards creating a value proposition which will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they are required to operate with contextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to the customer while taking into account the organisational requirements and strategic aims. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"&gt;http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/crosscuttings/leadership_entrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/09/CEO-Entrepreneur-Article-March-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legacee.com"&gt;http://www.legacee.com/Info/Leadership/LeadershipEntrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrepreneurial leader takes responsibility for their actions and those actions must be more proactive than reactive. They think about achieving organisational outcomes in an innovative way and working with a diverse group of people and resources to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="legacee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACf6aSDfbc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcaMjhsWtI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Perhaps the best known and most widely considered example of an entrepreneurial leader is [[Steve Jobs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/blog/steve-jobs-a-true-transformational-leader/&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many real life examples in the world of business and other industries, such as [[Bill Gates]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://4entrepreneur.net/2007/09/19/11-principles-of-entrepreneurial-leadership/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has been ongoing for centuries. History's greatest philosophical writings from Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' to Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?". Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait theory|trait theory of leadership]]".

The concept of entrepreneurial leadership was introduced in 2000 by [[Rita Gunther McGrath|McGrath]] and MacMillan who suggested that in dynamic markets where there is increased uncertainty and competitive pressure a new type of leader is required. They described this as the "entrepreneurial leader". These fast changing markets or situations give those with an "entrepreneurial" approach the ability to exploit opportunities to gain advantage for their organisation faster than others.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 2000. The entrepreneurial mindset : strategies for continuously creating opportunity in an age of uncertainty. Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations have sought to develop the concept of entrepreneurial leadership within the business world. A good example is UBS, the global bank, which in the period 2002 to 2006 proactively developed entrepreneurial leadership amongst its top 500 leaders. The success of this was demonstrated by improvements in individual, team and financial performance, the project becoming a key element in the Harvard Business School Case study, "UBS Aligning the Integrated firm". The bank was subsequently awarded the title Best Company for Leaders (Europe) 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/Top_Companies_2005_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this project over a multi divisional bank spread globally was complex and took a number of years. This is reviewed in a case study by Chris Roebuck, Visiting Professor of Transformational Leadership at Cass Business School in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231722/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck was one of the leaders of the team who implemented entrepreneurial leadership in UBS.

The principles of entrepreneurial leadership can be applied to a number of sectors and to a wide variety of organisations. The success of this approach has confirmed the compatibility of entrepreneurial leadership to the majority of organisations seeking to improve client/customer service and overall performance.

Prof Chris Roebuck notes that in recent examples of applying entrepreneurial leadership to organisations, the link to employee engagement has increasingly become as a key success factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723135817/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also allowed development of the concept of entrepreneurial support functions, such as Entrepreneurial HR and Entrepreneurial IT, to support the customer or client facing parts of organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/08/Different-Slant-Chris-roebuck-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial Leadership is not so much a style of leadership as a focus of leadership and employees' efforts on specific actions that either maximise the effectiveness of service delivery currently or seek to improve it in the future.

==&lt;!-- The styles of leadership do not describe styles of Entrepreneurial Leadership. This section should thus be removed. --&gt;Styles of leadership==
Leadership style refers to a leader's behavior. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], Political Style, U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Participative or democratic style===
The democratic leadership style favors decision-making by the group. Such a leader gives instructions after consulting the group. They can win the cooperation of their group and can motivate them effectively and positively. The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral as with the autocrat because they arise from consultation with the group members and participation by them.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian style===
Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13610">'''False necessity''', or '''anti-necessitarian social theory''', is a contemporary [[social theory]] that argues for the plasticity of social organizations and their potential to be shaped in new ways.  The theory rejects the assumption that laws of change govern the history of human societies and limit human freedom.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a critique of "necessitarian" thought in conventional social theories (like [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]]) which hold that parts of the social order are necessary or the result of the natural flow of history. The theory rejects the idea that human societies must be organized in a certain way (for example, [[liberal democracy]]) and that human activity will adhere to certain forms (for example if people were only motivated by [[homo economicus|rational self-interest]]).

''False necessity'' uses [[Structuralism|structural analysis]] to understand socio-political arrangements, but discards the tendency to assemble indivisible categories and to create law-like explanations. It aims to liberate human activity from necessary arrangements and limitations, and to open up a world without constraints where the possible becomes actual.&lt;ref&gt;See Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task. Politics 2. New York: Verso; Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy. Politics, a Work in Constructive Social Theory. London: Verso; Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Plasticity into Power: Comparative-historical Studies of the Institutional Conditions of Economic and Military Success. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Modern social theory contains a tension between the realization of human freedom and the necessity of social rules.&lt;ref&gt;This background is drawn from Ian Shapiro, "Review: Constructing Politics," Political Theory 17, no. 3 (1989): 475-482, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), Bernard Yack, ''The longing for total revolution: philosophic sources of social discontent from Rousseau to Marx and Nietzsche'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1986), Bernard Yack, "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1961-1977.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical liberalism#Intellectual sources|Liberal political theorists]] of the seventeenth century, such as [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive on one side of the road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a [[state of nature]]. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.

These early [[Age of Enlightenment#Important intellectuals|Enlightenment thinkers]] opposed existing religious, aristocratic, and absolutist institutions and organizations as the natural state of the world. However, they did not argue for the absolute freedom of the individual outside of any constraining rules. For them, human activity was still subject to certain types of social arrangements that followed a historical necessity.  

Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thesis of [[Immanuel Kant#Idea of freedom|human freedom]], which argued that there is no evidence to disprove our absolute freedom or capacity to resist external domination, thinkers at the end of the eighteenth century addressed how human freedoms were constrained by social institutions. Thinkers like [[Fichte]], [[Schiller]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Hegel]] argued that those institutions that constrain human freedom and subject the individual to fear and prejudice insult human dignity and deny the individual his autonomy. But they attempted to formulate universal laws, which in turn led to deterministic social and political arrangements. Marx, for example, put humanity at the mercy of historical and institutional necessity. 

The contemporary theory of false necessity attempts to realize this idea in its entirety, and to escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories. It aims to realize social plasticity by decoupling human freedom from any necessary social rules or historical trajectory. The theory recognizes the need for social rules, but also affirms the human potential to transcend them. Humanity need not be constrained by any structure.

==Development and content==
The development of the theory is credited to philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. His main book on the thesis, ''False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy'', was first published in 1987 by Cambridge University Press, and reissued in 2004 by Verso with a new 124 page introduction, and a new appendix, "Five theses on the relation of religion to politics, illustrated by allusions to Brazilian experience."&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory,'' second edition (London: Verso, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of ''false necessity'' attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves the object of a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and how they can be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

Rather than "enabling constraint" or "universal structure", the theory advocates "structure-denying structures"—that is, structures that enable their own dissolution and remaking. Since these structures normally constrain our activities, this would increase our freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Hugh. 1987. "Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement." Journal of Law and Society 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of entrapment and emancipation==
The problem of false necessity arises due to the failure of transformative practice to realize its stated aim. This can take form in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the ideals fought for (democracy, decentralization, technical coordination, etc.) result in the development of rigid institutions
*an oligarchy effect in which groups and rulers clash at the summit of power and drum up popular support
*the survival effect in which there is a fear of disturbance of contemporary arrangements.

Unger points to mass politics as a means to counter oligarchy and group identity. However, if these forms are only disturbed and not destroyed, democracy is limited and becomes a quarrel about forms of power and seizing advantage. Likewise, enlarged economic rationality provides another source of emancipation by shifting economic and social relations in the ability to constantly innovate and renew.&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"/&gt;

==The radical project==
The theory of ''false necessity'' develops the idea that the organization of society is made and can be remade—we can rebel against the worlds we have built; we can interrupt our rebellions and establish ourselves in any of those worlds. By emphasizing the disembodiment of institutional and social structures, the theory provides a basis to explain ourselves and our world without using necessitarian thought or predetermined institutional arrangements.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

At the extreme, the theory of ''false necessity'' criticizes and thus unifies strands of the radical tradition. It frees leftist and liberal ideals from institutional fetishism, and emancipates modernist ideals from structural fetishism. The theory further detaches the radical commitment from utopian claims and provides a theoretical basis for transformative action.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; That transformative action, Unger believes, does not have to be a complete overhaul or total revolution, but rather is "a piecemeal but cumulative change in the organization of society".&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the project, in the words of one critic, "is to complete the rebellion against the naturalistic fallacy (that is, the confusion of accident with essence and contingency with necessity) and to effect an irrevocable emancipation from false necessity".&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C. "Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women." The University of Toronto Law Journal 40, no. 2 (April 1, 1990): 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and opinions==

Contemporary{{when|date=September 2014}} political thinkers and philosophers have developed and advocated the theory of false necessity. [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] has employed the theory in developing social, political, and economic alternatives,&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''Democracy realized: the progressive alternative.'' London: Verso, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''Free trade reimagined: the world division of labor and the method of economics.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''The future of American progressivism: an initiative for political and economic reform.'' Boston: Beacon Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''The left alternative.'' London: Verso, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in his political activism and appointments in Brazilian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Eyal|title=The Passion of Roberto Unger|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9903/unger.html|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barrionuevo | first = Alexei | title = 'Minister of Ideas' Tries to Put Brazil's Future in Focus | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2008-02-02 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/world/americas/02unger.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rorty]] compared the theory's move towards greater liberalism with [[Jürgen Habermas]], and called it a powerful alternative to the postmodern "[[School of Resentment]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard. "Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance of a National Future." ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 82 (1988 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers have said the theory is "a challenge that the social disciplines can ignore only at their peril".&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989): 447.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Yack]] wrote that it contributed to "a new left Kantian approach to the problem of realizing human freedom in our social institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation." ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GSIS-Meralco case''' is a political controversy and pending legal case being heard by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. This complex case began with a complaint filed by the Philippines' [[Government Service Insurance System (Philippines)|Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] of the Philippines (SEC) questioning the unvalidated proxy votes used by the Lopez family in a board election of the [[Meralco|Manila Electric Company]] (Meralco). The SEC issued a [[Cease and desist|cease and desist order]] (CDO) against Meralco, which was ignored by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/28/MAIN20080528125795.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Order to show cause|show cause order]] (SCO) was then issued by the SEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/29/yehey/top_stories/20080529top1.html |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624020956/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/29/yehey/top_stories/20080529top1.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Meralco petitioned the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]], questioning the jurisdiction of the SEC. The Court of Appeals issued a [[Injunction|temporary restraining order]] (TRO) to the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2008/05/31/MAIN20080531126120.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Special 9th Division composed of Associate Justices Vicente Q. Roxas, Jose L. Sabio Jr. and Myrna Dimaranan Vidal heard the case. Roxas was assigned as the ponente while Sabio was the acting chairman.

Later, Sabio called a press conference and alleged that an [[Ambassador|emissary]] of Meralco tried to bribe him with [[Philippine peso|₱]]10 million to have a case transferred to another appeals court justice. The criminal charges are [[obstruction of justice]] and [[malfeasance in office]].&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20080801/tph-senate-won-t-probe-bribe-try-on-ca-j-d6cd5cf.html ph.news.yahoo.com, Senate won't probe bribe try on CA justice]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabio did not mention any names, but businessman Francis de Borja stepped forward and claimed that he was the alleged emissary, accusing Sabio of asking for a ₱50 million bribe to side with Meralco, in response to De Borja's question “What will it take for you to resist the government’s offer?” The alleged government offer was a Supreme Court position. In the latter course of the investigation, Sabio let slip that his brother, [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG) Chairman [[Camilo Sabio]], called him up twice to urge him to side favorably with the government. The late admission of the allegedly unethical and criminal action called into doubt the innocence of Sabio in coming forward with his expose and the veracity of his entire story. These acts are alleged to be punishable under Article 208 and 243 of the Revised Penal Code respectively.&lt;ref name="opinion.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view/20080813-154255/The-original-sin |title=The original sin - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215205124/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view/20080813-154255/The-original-sin |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsbreak.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsbreak.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5256&amp;Itemid=88889051 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060246/http://newsbreak.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5256&amp;Itemid=88889051 |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also came out during the course of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] investigation that Court of Appeals Justice Vicente Roxas, the ponente of the controversial Meralco decision, had himself committed improprieties. One such impropriety was that Roxas preempted the legal opinion of Presiding Justice [[Conrado M. Vasquez|Conrado Vasquez]] that the Special 9th Division should have ruled on the case as per the Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (IRCA), and not the 8th Division to which Roxas was transferred, and which eventually promulgated a ruling in favor of Meralco, with Justices Reyes and Apolinario Bruselas hastily signing the ponencia without going over or reading the memoranda submitted by concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/14/yehey/top_stories/20080814top2.html |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817121137/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/14/yehey/top_stories/20080814top2.html |archivedate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court, voting 12–1, ordered the dismissal of Roxas after he was found guilty of multiple violations of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, grave misconduct, dishonesty, undue interest and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080909-159535/5-CA-justices-committed-lapses--SC-probers-report |title=SC dismisses CA justice in bribery case - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609211112/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080909-159535/5-CA-justices-committed-lapses--SC-probers-report |archive-date=2012-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabio was suspended for two months after he was found guilty of simple misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a justice of the CA. Vasquez was severely reprimanded “for his failure to act promptly and decisively in order to avert the incidence that damaged the image of the Court of Appeals,” Reyes was found guilty of simple misconduct with mitigating circumstance, and Vidal was found guilty of conduct unbecoming of a justice of the appellate court for being “too compliant" when she allowed herself to sign the decision without reading the parties’ memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20080909/tph-ca-justice-sacked-4-others-chastised-d6cd5cf.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It started on May 11, 2008, when the Philippines' [[Government Service Insurance System (Philippines)|Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) accused [[Meralco]] of unlawful refusal to grant corporate access to documents despite the GSIS’ holding 4 seats in the 11-member Meralco board, amid GSIS' denial of plans to wrest control from the Lopez family.

The scandal originated from the Meralco and GSIS row after Sabio—in a letter-complaint against Justices Vicente Roxas and Bienvenido Reyes—complained of the circumstances that he was removed from the Meralco-GSIS case after a standard court reorganization, and an alleged bribe attempt by Manolo Lopez and Meralco in consideration for him giving way to Reyes' chairmanship of the CA's Special 9th Division&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1783818/ tradingmarkets.com, CA junks SEC's cease-and-desist order on Meralco even as GSIS scores ruling]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It catches nationwide attention when businessman Francis De Borja surfaces and accuses Sabio via sworn affidavit that the justice had asked for P50 million to back away from the case, to counter a government offer of money and a Supreme Court appointment in exchange for a ruling favorable to GSIS.

===Background===
In 1962, Don Eugenio López, Sr. acquired MERALCO and it finally became Filipino-owned, but [[Ferdinand Marcos]], by decree,  placed it under a [[shell company]] called the [[Meralco Foundation, Inc.]], controlled by crony under government controlled [[National Power Corporation|Napocor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meralco.com.ph/ |title=Meralco website |publisher=Meralco.com.ph |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Meralco was fully controlled by the Marcos administration, but its ownership was finally returned to the Lopez family after the [[People Power Revolution]] by President [[Corazon Aquino]]. By [[Statutory Instrument|executive order]], she allowed Meralco to directly compete with NAPOCOR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bello|first=Walden|author2=Marissa De Guzman |author3=Mary Lou Malig |author4=Herbert Docena |title=The Anti-development State: The Political Economy of Permanent Crisis in the Philippines|publisher=Zed Books|year=2005|page=293|isbn=1-84277-631-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3S0ukwMn8LoC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=meralco+world+war&amp;lr=&amp;sig=TPqoP76Kr7z-FhRVj8ROjJptJhE|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on May 2, 2008, announced plans to reduce [[Luzon]] high power rates, amid  a “tough legal fight” with Meralco before state energy regulators. Accordingly, GSIS, through its President Winston Garcia, on May 11, stated it "planned not only to buy out the Lopez family and other shareholders in Meralco but also to break up its concession to promote efficiency and transparency." But Meralco chair and CEO Manuel Lopez said he was not selling the utility.

===The cases and facts===
Oscar Lopez blamed the Arroyo administration's moves to take over Meralco in a “reverse privatization,” because of the Lopez-owned [[ABS-CBN]]'s negative publicity against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151744/Timeline-GSIS-Meralco-controversy |title=inquirer.net, Timeline: GSIS-Meralco controversy |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823085218/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151744/Timeline-GSIS-Meralco-controversy |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====May 27 stockholders’ meeting====
During the May 27, 2008 stockholders’ meeting, GSIS' President Winston Garcia obtained an SEC “cease-and-desist order” to stop and defer the counting of proxy votes held by the Lopez group until questions on its validity were resolved. GSIS accused the Lopezes of “rigging” the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html tribune.net.ph Explain root of scandal, GSIS chief asks two justices SC urged to focus on ‘case switching’ 08/03/2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807023618/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html |date=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GSIS failed to gain control of Meralco after a TRO from the Court of Appeals is issued, and the SEC order placed on hold. Meralco retained its 5 seats, the government its 4, while the 2 others are independent directors [[Artemio Panganiban]] and Vicente Panlilio. Aside from Manuel Lopez, the Meralco directors elected are Jesus Francisco, Felipe Alfonso, Christian Monsod and [[Cesar Virata]], while the government board members elected aside from Garcia, are Bernardino Abes, Daisy Arce and Jeremy Parulan.

On May 30, the said [[temporary restraining order]] from the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]], against the SEC order from the 9th division, composed of Justices Roxas and Vidal was released. They are joined by substitute Justice Jose Sabio, replacement for Justice Bienvenido Reyes who was on leave. Despite the return of Justice Reyes in time from his leave, and his trying to claiming back his post, Sabio refused to give up the position. The TRO is released with Sabio signing instead.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storyPage.aspx?storyId=127392 |title=ABS-CBNNews.com &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=2012-02-19 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Associate Justice Rodrigo Cosico retires, and the Court of Appeals undergoes a mandatory reorganization. Following court rules, the case followed the Justice-writer assigned to it, Justice Vicente Roxas. The case moved to the 8th division, composed of Justice Reyes, Roxas, and Bruselas.

The Court's 8th Division renders a 57-page [[judgment (law)|judgment]] authored by Justice Vicente Roxas on July 24 against the GSIS, affirming Meralco's stance that the SEC has no jurisdiction over the issue.&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1800093/ tradingmarkets.com, CA en banc refers case of warring justices in controversial Meralco ruling to SC]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large scale negative media blitz is launched by unknown persons against the author of the decision Justice Roxas.

Justice Myrna Dimaranan-Vidal, together with Justice Jose Sabio, former special 9th Division members, challenged the decision, per letter to CA Presiding Justice Conrado Vasquez Jr., thus: "How can the 8th Division issue an order when it is the 9th that has been hearing the complaint of alleged irregularities in the Meralco election?" It is also the 9th Division that issued the temporary restraining order on the SEC order to Meralco on May 30."

Assistant Clerk of Court, lawyer Manuel Cervantes, said no irregularity had been committed when the 8th division came out with the decision instead of the 9th, simply a result of the reorganization of the court. "The case goes with the ''ponente''(justice assigned to pen the case),” Cervantes explained.  “Justice Vicente Roxas is the ponente. Even with the change in division, the case stays with him." “Due to the retirement of some justices, Justice Vidal was reassigned to the 6th Division while Reyes became chair of the 8th,” Cervantes said. Roxas was moved to the 8th division, Vidal went to the 6th, and Sabio to the 9th.  And since the rule is that the case goes with the ponente,the 57-page decision was issued by the division of which Justice Roxas was now a part, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/star/20080804/tph-confidence-crisis-ca-b4b2a3e.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permission is not required from the previous division nor its justices.

He said the IRCA (Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals) does not require the justices who issued the TRO be the same justices to render the decision.

The Court of Appeals Reorganization Office Order No. 200-08-CMV was issued by Presiding Justice Vasquez on July 4, three weeks before the decision was released.

Justice Jose Sabio refuses to let go of the Meralco GSIS case, and insists on being a part of the division to decide the case. He submits the case to the internal rules committee of the court, headed by Justice Edgardo P. Cruz. The Court of Appeals committee decides as early as June 20 that the committee, which clarifies internal rules of the court, rejects Justice Sabio's argument that the pending case should go with him following a court reorganization. By the rules, the division headed by Justice Bienvenido L. Reyes should hear the leadership row at Meralco. Sabio disregards Cruz's recommendation on the basis he was only a "junior justice".&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"/&gt;

On July 26, Justice Sabio, with the encouragement of  Justice Vidal (his colleague in the 9th Special Division) broke a bribery attempt news and wrote to P.J. Vasquez, Jr.  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151737/Full-text-of-Sabio-letter-to-Vasquez |title=Full text of Sabio letter to Vasquez July 26, 2008 |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000544/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151737/Full-text-of-Sabio-letter-to-Vasquez |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Justice Vidal, initiating further, a media expose of their squabbles, alleging something “stinks” in the Meralco court ruling.

Roxas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/images/news/newspics/downloads/CAdocs.pdf July 24, 2008 Letter of P.J. Conrado Vasquez, Jr. to Justices Bienvenido L. Reyes &amp; Vicente Q.

Businessman Francis de Borja emerges and reveals to the media a notarized and sworn affidavit that it was Justice Sabio who brought up a P50 million price for him to act in favor of Meralco in its dispute with the GSIS. Mr. de Borja asserts that Mr. Sabio had told him a Supreme Court seat was being offered in exchange for a ruling in favor of the GSIS, which is trying to wrest control of Meralco from the Lopezes. Expecting Sabio to answer that he would not be swayed by any offer and would rule according to his conscience, De Borja asked what it would take for him to resist the supposed government offer of a seat on the Supreme Court and money. He was taken aback when Sabio replied "P50 million”, and then left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |title=De Borja insists Sabio cited P50-M figure - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000555/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presiding Justice Conrado Vasquez comes under fire in the newspapers. Vasquez is criticized of having been able to spare the Court this trouble on the court's integrity had he followed the recommendation of the rules committee. With Vasquez's opinion favoring Sabio despite the reorganization, and the lack of a preliminary injunction that would exempt Meralco from being transferred to Reyes's and Roxas's division, doubt is cast on Vasquez's motivations.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"/&gt;

Manolo Lopez calls the accusations of Sabio a malicious and a pure fabrication. He vehemently denied the allegations, especially Sabio's accusation that he (Lopez) was waiting in the car during the meeting. He said he was out of the country for a medical check-up when the incident supposedly happened, and returned only last July 13. As proof, he showed tickets showing his departure dated June 27 and his arrival dated July 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bworldonline.com/BW080208/content.php?id=041&amp;src=2 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel investigation finds out that Chairman Camilo Sabio of the Presidential Commission on Good Government(PCGG) called up his brother, Justice Jose Sabio Jr. twice. The first time on May 30, to lobby his brother to adopt the position of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) versus Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). This was hours before the Ninth Division of the Court of Appeals (temporarily headed by Sabio) issued a temporary restraining order in Meralco's favor. Camilo called up Jose at 8 a.m., when the court's practice is to hand down its decisions at 10 a.m. Then, after the Court of Appeals decided the case with finality on July 23, Camilo called up Jose again, asking why he hadn’t signed the decision.

When Camilo called the first time, he informed Jose that he was going to be the acting chairman of the Special Ninth Division of the court; and that furthermore, a TRO against the Securities and Exchange Commission order that the GSIS desired was being prepared. Camilo suggested to Jose that the latter shouldn’t sign the TRO. When Camilo called once more, it was to ask why the 8th Division, and not the Special 9th Division had decided. Justice Jose had lobbied strenuously to head the 8th even after Justice Bienvenido Reyes, the person he was substituting for, was back on the job.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Romeo Callejo Sr., one of those conducting the investigation, castigated Justice Sabio why he didn’t bring up the intervention of his brother previously—or reprimand his brother. “Why did you not report your brother’s attempt to influence you? That was unethical. You did nothing; you are a professor of ethics. Did you not consider that your brother’s attempt was criminal?” Callejo asked.

Sabio's replies alternated between the irrelevant (his brother was older than he, he said) to patent hair-splitting (there was no outright offer of a bribe from his brother). They only reduced the reasonable doubt so far supporting Sabio by reducing the options the justice operated under to three: he was hopelessly naïve; he has been too clever for his own good; or he is a bumbling prisoner of circumstance, who has blown the lid off a legal system so thoroughly tainted it cannot absolve itself the longer the inquiry continues.

This called into question Justice Sabio's squabble with fellow Reyes over who should have jurisdiction over the case. It explained why Justice Sabio would, in turn, on July 1, meet lawyer Francis de Borja to discuss a case he had every reason to know would be brought up by a party friendly to Meralco. It's either that the Ateneo de Manila Law School's professor of legal ethics had no comprehension of the subject he teaches or he is a plain and simple hypocrite. He brags about his being a righteous professor of legal ethics which we can never believe now after knowing from the investigation his lapses to perform what is expected of a member of the court.

This provided circumstantial evidence for concluding that Sabio was playing off both sides to see who might bid highest, confirming, incidentally, many details in De Borja's affidavit while calling into question the completeness, and ultimately the veracity, of Sabio's own statements.

Justice Sabio move to come forward to virtuously blow the whistle is cast in doubt by his selectivity. He denied allegations of Palace blandishments to do the GSIS’ bidding, but he left out his brother's intervention. He is looking more and more like a double-dealer who got a juicy Palace offer but tried to cash in quickly by basically making it obvious to the other side he would be open to a counteroffer.
&lt;ref name="opinion.inquirer.net"/&gt;

As a government official, Camilo's act of calling his brother to influence his decision is punishable under Article 243 of the Revised Penal Code. Article 243 (orders or requests by executive offices to any judicial authority) states that :"Any executive officer who shall address any order or suggestion to any judicial authority with respect to any case or business coming within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of justice shall suffer the penalty of arresto mayor and a fine."

As an official of the Court, Justice Sabio is mandated under Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code to report any possible violation of the law, with negligence and tolerance as the offending act. Article 208 states: “The penalty of prison correctional in its minimum period (six months and 1 day to 2 years and four months) and suspension shall be imposed upon any public officer or officer of the law who, in dereliction of the duties of his office, shall maliciously refrain from instituting prosecution for the punishment of violations of the law, or shall tolerate the commission of offenses.” &lt;ref name="newsbreak.com.ph"/&gt; The public is in anticipation whether criminal charges for bribery and violation of Article 208 of the RPC will be filed against Sabio the soonest possible time to determine the extent of his culpability.

====Attempted bribery and discipline of Philippine jurists and lawyers====
[[Bribery]] [[attempt]], in Philippine Jurisprudence, is considered a [[Crime|criminal offense]] or [[felony]].

[[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Justices are under the administrative supervision of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], and may be disciplined by [[Disbarment]] or dismissal from service, under the Revised Rules of Court (1997 [[Code of Civil Procedure]]).

Also, the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]]' "Process of Adjudication" is governed by A.M. No. 02-6-13-CA 2005, the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (RIRCA), Specific Amendments to, 2002 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, February 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.supremecourt.gov.ph/images/references_corner/2002ircaamendments.pdf A.M.

====Application to this case====
Justice Sabio informed Philippine media that he was offered P 10 million (through a Makati businessman, which he rejected) to recuse himself from the GSIS-Meralco case, which was decided by the 8th Division's Justice Vicente Roxas, the designated ponente, with the concurring opinions of Justices Bienvenido Reyes and Antonio Bruselas. Roxas was transferred from the 9th Division, when the case was pending. Sabio revealed to media that: “It turned out that he was brokering for Meralco.” Sabio appeared on a TV interview by [[GMA Network]] reporter Carlo Lorenzo in his chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/26500/QTV-CA-justice-says-decision-on-Meralco-GSIS-row-railroaded |title=QTV: gmanews.tv, CA justice says decision on Meralco-GSIS row railroaded, 07/31/2008 |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cagayan de Oro City]] businessman Francis Roa de Borja, in his July 31, 2008 [[affidavit]], swore that: "when he asked what it would take for him to resist the government offer, Sabio's reply was: “Fifty million (pesos)"; Sabio wanted to remain as acting chairman of the 9th Division because he was up to something; that Sabio consulted his other colleagues in the CA and they told him that he was in the right and should stick to his guns; that was then Sabio told Borja about the offer of unnamed government officials for a promotion at the SC and money for a favorable ruling for GSIS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/largevideo/home/26537/-QTV---CDO-Businessman-Justice-Sabio-named-his-price-to-favor-GSIS-over-Meralco |title=QTV: gmanews.tv/largevideo, CDO Businessman: Justice Sabio named his price to favor GSIS over Meralco |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110682/Businessman-turns-tables-on-CA-justice-over-alleged-Meralco-bribe |title=gmanews.tv/story, Businessman turns tables on CA justice over alleged Meralco bribe |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Borja accused Sabio of twisting the facts: "No, I never said that. If you know Manolo Lopez -- he is somewhat aristocratic -- he would be the last person to wait for somebody in the car, and they did not know that he was abroad at that time. I said in my affidavit that he told me his wife would be waiting for him in the car and he says now that Manolo was waiting in my car..."

De Borja stated that he was ready to face charge of [[perjury]] and to take a lie detector test with Sabio before competent foreign experts and together: "It’s a free county, let him file it and we’ll see. I’m prepared, the moment I signed my affidavit obviously I considered the consequences so I wouldn’t have made up a story. And my third comment is he is a lawyer and a justice. He knows that a lie detector test is not admissible as evidence so why is he asking for it?’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |title=inquirer.net, De Borja insists Sabio cited P50-M figure |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000555/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080801-152102/De-Borja-insists-Sabio-cited-P50-M-figure |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Borja was interviewed and appeared at [[ABS-CBN]] News Channel's ([[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]]) Dateline Philippines, and he repeated his media statements: "No definitely not...He [Sabio] says that Manolo was waiting for me in my car. I never said it. And if you know Manolo...Can you imagine somebody like Manolo being made to wait in a car? Di ba, yung pagka aristocratic ni Manolo, maghihintay sa kotse? The fact is, he was abroad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=127020 abs-cbnnews.com, Lopez denies trying to bribe CA justice] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/111141/Sabio-accuser-in-CA-bribery-try-agrees-to-lie-detector-test |title=gmanews.tv, Sabio accuser in CA bribery try agrees to lie detector test |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-08-03 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a shadowy group, "Tanglaw ng Bayan," paid an advertisement on a [[Metro Manila]] newspaper, appealing "that the CA justices not be subjected to malicious imputations just to advance the agenda of powerful interests, and to allow the CA to "sort out its internal issues." In 2007, it also petitioned the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Senate to probe the [[Hello Pappy scandal|"Hello Pappy" scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110534/CA-justice-mum-on-identity-of-broker-in-GSIS-Meralco-row |title=gmanews.tv/story, CA justice mum on identity of ‘broker’ in GSIS-Meralco row |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2008, after a rare 3-hour, closed-door [[En Banc]] session attended by 64 CA Justices presided by P.J. Vasquez, Jr., the CA Clerk of Court Teresita Marigomen announced the [[appellate court]]'s resolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news2_july31_2008 |title=manilastandardtoday.com, 65 justices to review ‘fishy’ Meralco order |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that they will refer the investigation of the propriety of action of concerned justices to the Supreme Court through the Office of the Court Administrator";
* "they will leave the matter on the validity of the Meralco decision to the parties, to take whatever steps they may deem necessary after all the allegations"; and,
* "they will refer the issue of the conflict on rules to an internal committee within the appellate court."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151800/UPDATE-2-CA-seeks-SC-probe-over-P10-M-bribe-try |title=inquirer.net, SC to probe conflict, bribery attempt in CA on Meralco case |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000610/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151800/UPDATE-2-CA-seeks-SC-probe-over-P10-M-bribe-try |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Roxas challenged the En Banc meeting as a “disguised investigation” of the 8th Division's judgment on the Meralco case, further alleging that under the Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, a case followed the ponente to whatever division the ponente went: “Besides, all hearings in the Court of Appeals are recorded and the members of the 8th Division only need the transcripts of the hearing or the memoranda, briefs, comments and replies of the parties—which are all written.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151732/Justice-bares-P10-M-bribe |title=inquirer.net, Justice bares P10-M bribe, Sabio tags emissary of Meralco |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000637/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080731-151732/Justice-bares-P10-M-bribe |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabio Jr. He related that because he is very close to the Lopezes of Meralco, he wanted to call him (Sabio) regarding his possible inhibition in a certain Meralco case, wherein he was designated as a substitute member of the division vice a justice who was temporarily on-leave by reason of sickness. He further said that the Lopezes desire that the same Justice, with whom the Lopezes are more comfortable, to sit in the division. So, I gave Francis de Borja the cell phone number of Justice Jose L.

[[Meralco]] chair Manolo lopez, in a press conference on August 2, denied any involvement in the alleged bribery attempt: “I categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of Justice Jose Sabio. Mind you, I do not have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except my wife. The [allegations are] malicious and pure fabrication. I am a resident of [[Rockwell Center]]. I know Francis but I have not authorized him or anybody to make representations for [me on] any matter that involves cases of Meralco and the Lopez family. We have retainers and lawyers to handle legal matters.I was out of the country when the alleged meeting between Francis and Justice Sabio took place. I was in the [[United States]] for a medical check up and returned on July 13." Lopez's officials showed media, tickets of his departure, June 27, and his arrival, July 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top2.html manilatimes.net, Manolo lopez says Sabio’s charges a fabrication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805090132/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top2.html |date=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lopez group led by First Philippine Holdings Corp. has a 33.47% share interest in Meralco, while the [[Philippine]] government financial institutions own 33.32%. Other shareholders hold 34.21%.

=====CA chambers press conference=====
Sabio, on August 1, First Friday, held a press conference in his CA [hambers, and stated to media: {{cquote|...I expect matters to get worse because I am up against the billions of the Lopezes. But that Mr. de Borja would have the nerve to make these lies, under oath, is utterly disgusting when it was he who came to me with the offer of the bribe. He [de Borja] further said that the Lopezes desire that the same justice, with whom the Lopezes are more comfortable, sit in the division. Mr. de Borja called me, so suddenly, and after having had no contact [with him] for almost a year. At that point, he [de Borja] mentioned the impasse between Justice Bienvenido Reyes and myself. Then he [de Borja] explained that he was there to offer me a win-win situation. He said, Justice, we have P10 million. At that point, I was shocked that he had a very low regard for me. He was treating me like there was a price on my person. I could not describe my feelings. I was stunned. I cannot in conscience agree to that [offer to bribe me]. The Lopezes will do everything possible using their money and power to discredit me. This is just the beginning. I know that they will not stop at doing everything to discredit my integrity.”}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top1.html manilatimes.net, Sabio: Lopezes my slayers, Businessman’s bribe allegations filthy lies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805022412/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/02/yehey/top_stories/20080802top1.html |date=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/images/news/newspics/slideshows/images/frontdoor/20080801Justice-Jose-Sabio-jrKC3M7250PAG.jpgInsert{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

=====Jurisdictional issue=====
The internal strife and open quarrel over signature space on a [[judgment (law)|judgment]] pushed the appellate court to the edge and is now at the center of a [[maelstrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=alvinCapino_aug1_2008 |title=manilastandardtoday.com, Delicadeza’ at the court |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), raised a legal point,  challenging the 8th CA Division's judgment dismissing GSIS's petition filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)]]
against [[Meralco]]. The [[certiorari]] and [[injunction]] CA [[lawsuit]] was raffled off to the CA's 9th Division chaired by Justice Bienvenido Reyes (on leave at the time). A special raffle designated Reyes’ replacement,  Justice Jose Sabio (as chair). With Justices Vicente Roxas and Myrna Vidal as members, the 9th Division heard the case. (The GSIS moved to recuse Roxas on account of reports that "he met with Meralco lawyers on the day a temporary restraining order [TRO] was issued by the CA, barring the SEC from taking jurisdiction over the GSIS complaint against Meralco.")

Sabio's chairmanship issue with Reyes over the Special Ninth Division was overtaken by a July 4, 2008, reorganization at the Court of Appeals. Reyes and Roxas ended up in the 8th Division, which finally resolved the case in favor of the Lopez group on July 23. Sabio was reassigned as chairman of the 6th Division. Sabio later complained that Roxas penned the decision even before either side had submitted their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news1_aug2_2008 |title=Sabio, Lopez friend trade ‘lies’ on live TV |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Reyes failed to assume the chairmanship of the 9th Division in place of Sabio, and the CA's 8th Division, chaired by Reyes and with ponente, Justices Roxas and Apolinario Bruselas as members, forthwith promulgated the challenged [[judgment (law)|judgment]] in favor of Meralco. GSIS called the ruling, a “patent nullity for such dismissal [of the GSIS case before the SEC] was not even prayed for by Meralco in its petition with the Court of Appeals.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/july/31/yehey/opinion/20080731opi7.html manilatimes.net, FROM THE SIDELINES A court jurisdictional issue] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013031434/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/july/31/yehey/opinion/20080731opi7.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

P.J. Vasquez wrote Justices Sabio and Vidal that as members of their newly reconstituted 8th division, they are not very familiar with the case. Vasquez earlier granted Sabio a verbal go-signal to proceed in hearing the June 23 [[oral argument]]. Vasquez reiterated that "Sabio’s 9th division, since it issued a temporary restraining order (TRO), and its members heard and participated in the June 23 hearing, should “sign and resolve” the case. To allow the new division of Justice B.L. Reyes as Chairman, Justice Roxas, as ponente, and Justice Bruselas, Jr. as the third member, the resolution of the pending incidents in the case will be participated by two (2) members who were not present and did not hear the arguments during the hearing on the injunctive relief...”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=126888 abs-cbnnews.com, CA head decides for Sabio in rift on Meralco case] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=126887 abs-cbnnews.com, Meralco legal war causes dissent among CA justices] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Certiorari====
[[File:Grino aquino.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Justice [[Carolina Grino-Aquino]], Chair of the Bribery Panel.]]

GSIS, on August 13, 2008, in 65-page [[certiorari]] petition, asked the Supreme Court to nullify the CA judgment that prevented the SEC from case intervention, "considering the SC probe is still ongoing." It argued that the Special 9th Division should have ruled on the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=128180 abs-cbnnews.com, GSIS asks Supreme Court to reverse CA on Meralco ruling] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joker Arroyo]] criticized the High Court's ruling, saying it should be, as sitting Justices investigate the case instead, since: "Delegating the investigation to a panel of retired justices who in turn will submit their findings to the high court for review and determination [is] akin to a trial by commissioners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080805-152791/SC-not-retired-justices-should-hear-CA-bribery-case |title=inquirer.net/breakingnews, ‘SC, not retired justices, should hear CA bribery case’ |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607001539/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080805-152791/SC-not-retired-justices-should-hear-CA-bribery-case |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines [[Social Weather Stations]] released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the [[judiciary]]; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted  they reported the bribery, because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9];  judges, however,  said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11];b) "Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to [[Sandiganbayan]] justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |title=www.sws.org.ph, New Diagnostic Study Sets Guideposts for Systematic Development of the Judiciary |publisher=Sws.org.ph |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073044/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |archivedate=2015-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |title=www.sws.org.ph, New SWS Study of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession Sees Some Improvements, But Also Recurring Problems |publisher=Sws.org.ph |date=2005-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072913/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |archivedate=2015-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CA controversies====
Created on February 1, 1936, the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] was initially composed of Justice Pedro Concepcion as the first Presiding Judge and 10 Appellate Judges appointed by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] with the consent of the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]] of the National Assembly. In March 1938, the appellate Judges were named Justices and their number increased from 11 to 15, with 3 divisions of  5 under Commonwealth Act No. 259. On December 24, 1941, there were 19 Justices under Executive Order No. 395. On February 23, 1995, R.A. No. 7902 expanding the jurisdiction of the Court effective March 18, 1995. On December 30, 1996, R.A. No. 8246 created six (6) more divisions in the Court, thereby increasing its membership from 51 to 69 Justices (additional divisions - 3 for [[Visayas]] and 3 for [[Mindanao]], the court's regionalization).

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] on March 21, 2008, upon recommendation of the investigator, [[Bernardo P. Pardo]], dismissed [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Justice Elvi John Asuncion for gross ignorance of the law and delaying motions of considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph/decisions.php?doctype=Decisions%20/%20Signed%20Resolutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd6460c2cfb6cf5e#sam elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph, Decision, CA Justice J Elvi Asuncion]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asuncion was charged of receiving money placed in “2 gym bags delivered to his office.” The Supreme Court, however, found no substantial evidence of [[bribery]], but it dismissed him for gross ignorance of the law for his issuance of an October 30, 2001, resolution in the case between Philippine National Bank, the National Labor Relations Commission and Erlinda Archinas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=127279 abs-cbnnews.com, SC dismissed CA justices in the past] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was only the 2nd Court of Appeals [[jurist]] to be dismissed, since the first firing in Philippine judicial history of CA Justice Demetrio G. Demetria, for interceding in theDOJ drug case of Yu Yuk Lai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2001/mar2001/am_00-7-09-ca_2001.html lawphil.net, En Banc, A.M.

The CA, thereafter became the center of controversy after Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]] ordered an investigation of the so-called "Dirty Dozen," particularly on the alleged “sale” of "Temporary Restraining Orders" ([[Injunction]], [[Restraining order abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/mar/21/yehey/top_stories/20070321top1.html manilatimes.net/national, Court of Appeals justice dismissed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329010745/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/mar/21/yehey/top_stories/20070321top1.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2007, Briccio Joseph Boholst, president of IBP — Cebu City Chapter, opposed the abolition of the CA in Cebu City, for it will cause inconvenience for both litigants and lawyers. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Ruben Reyes]] was tasked to investigate and submit recommendation to the High Tribunal because of the alleged massive graft and corruption of justices, especially in the issuance of temporary restraining orders (TRO's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/PROV20070819100756.html Manila Bulletin, IBP Cebu City opposes abolition of CA Cebu] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2007, [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Presiding Justice [[Ruben Reyes]] (now S.C. Justice) ordered an investigation and a regular auditing and inventory of temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by the 69 CA Justices. Reyes stated: “I will order a monthly or quarterly inventory of TROs, for transparency and to watch the movements of the so-called Dirty Dozen [the 12 most corrupt CA justices].”  [[Reynato Puno]] said that [[Ombudsman]] Merceditas Gutierrez had not yet submitted the list and the Supreme Court was waiting for its delivery amid her formal investigation against the “Dirty Dozen.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/apr/03/yehey/top_stories/20070403top5.html manilatimes.net, CA acts against Dirty 12, lamppost accused] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013021415/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/apr/03/yehey/top_stories/20070403top5.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2008, the Court celebrated its 72nd Anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/OPED20080201115915.html mb.com.ph, The Court of Appeals: The Second Highest Court of the Land] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
*Government Service Insurance System chief Garcia, on July 31, 2008, asked Justices Vicente Roxas and Bienvenido Reyes to resign and save the CA institution amid  plans to file criminal and administrative [[lawsuit]]s. Garcia accused both Justices as “Meralco switcheroo" in the case against GSIS: “The sordid details of Meralco’s behind-the-scene maneuverings as narrated by Justice Sabio merely put in public display the contempt the Lopezes have for the law. Lady Justice lies bleeding on the ground, and those who have bloods in their hands must be made to answer for this dastardly crime! I call on all Filipinos, especially my colleagues in the noble practice of law, to rise up in unison to condemn these moves by Meralco to protect its interest at the expense of what is right and just."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110668/P10-M-bribe-try-GSIS-chief-urges-2-CA-justices-to-resign%20P10-M%20bribe%20try: |title=gmanews.tv, GSIS chief urges 2 CA justices to resign |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Senator [[Francis Pangilinan]], in a statement, asked the High Court to "act swiftly to get to the bottom of the scandal and immediately punish the guilty. The SC must show no hesitation whatsoever in pursuing this controversy. The entire judiciary's reputation is tarnished by this scandal, and the swiftness within which the SC responds will determine whether the damage is temporary and minimal or if it will be massive and irreparable. The SC must respond with clear and convincing resoluteness by dismissing from the service the CA justices involved in the irregularities, if the evidence warrants it."
*Senate Minority Leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], Sabio's distant relative, said "whoever tried to bribe the CA should be made to account for the crime (Kung sino ang nag-offer ng bribe kay Justice Sabio, dapat ihabla kasi krimen yon e. Of course yung sinsabi ng abogado, dapat pakinggan din. Ang sama ng dating sa taongbayan because kumbaga, right at the doorstep na ng Supreme Court ito e. It's not only the national, but also the international reputation of the judiciary could be compromised). No formal investigations have been conducted regarding alleged irregularities in the judiciary, particularly in the Court of Appeals, because witnesses are afraid to testify against the so-called “hoodlums in robes".
*Senator [[Edgardo Angara]] said: "Of course, my God when you say that the second-highest level of the judiciary in the Philippines is corrupt and bribable, who's going to be safe investing here or even travelling here?"
*Senator [[Francis Escudero]] said: "there were enough laws to deal with the controversy. Besides, inter-branch courtesy dictates that the Senate would not meddle with the internal affairs of the judiciary. Supreme Court ang may jurisdiction to discipline erring judges and justices."
*Senator [[Loren Legarda]], a former [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] of Lopez-owned ABS-CBN, said: "the gravity of the accusation raised by Sabio were so damaging to the justice system and that they cannot be left unresolved. Sabio's revelation calls for everyone to have an open mind, and to come to conclusion only after a dispassionate and objective appreciation of evidencer. The appropriate criminal, civil or administrative cases must be filed against whoever will be found to have transgressed the law. The judiciary should be above suspicion if it will be effective in dispensing justice. We cannot have one branch of government being diminished by scandals like this."&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;
*The Senators jointly stated that: "Regardless of the outcome of Meralco-GSIS case at the CA, the senators also said it is clear the case can no longer be heard by Sabio since his fairness has already been tarnished by the various allegations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=127033 abs-cbnnews.com, SC urged to 'swiftly' probe bribery scandal in CA] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080804-152639/Corruption-in-Court-of-Appeals-widespread----senators |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Corruption in Court of Appeals widespread - senators |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607002215/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080804-152639/Corruption-in-Court-of-Appeals-widespread----senators |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fr. [[Joaquin G. Bernas]], [[Dean (education)|dean]] [[emeritus]] of the [[Ateneo Law School]], told the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], that:“The allegations will not do the judiciary any good but the investigation of the Supreme Court will. I don't know the facts. I consider (Sabio) to be an honest man.”
*Ateneo Law Dean [[Cesar L. Villanueva]] vouched for Sabio, saying "the CA justice is one of the well-respected faculty members of the Ateneo Law School."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Headlines&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=24&amp;aid=20080802147 Headlines Joker to SC: Act on CA mess swiftly By Aurea Calica Sunday, August 3, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919181436/http://www.philstar.com/index.php?Headlines&amp;p=49&amp;type=2&amp;sec=24&amp;aid=20080802147 |date=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Ateneo Law School]] student body, per by [[student council]] president Jess Lopez, stated: "We, his current students, stand as witnesses to his fairness and impartiality, which are beyond reproach, and the genuine manner in which he implores us to stand against all forms of corruption in all aspects of law and governance. The respect we have for Sabio is derived not only from his remarkable skill in teaching, but likewise from his indubitable sense of justice, moral conduct, and service to society. Sabio’s reputation of being a “professor of utmost integrity who will not and cannot be fazed by unjust and wrongful considerations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Kwok |url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/education/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20080801-152063 |title=inquirer.net/specialfeatures, Sabio’s law students express support |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alberto Lim, executive director of the Makati Business Club (MBC) MBC, said: "if Sabio is telling the truth, the MBC would be dismayed at Meralco's moves to bribe a CA justice. On the other hand, if De Borja is telling the truth about Sabio's P50 million bribe demand, it would be a big setback to the judiciary." Sabio said that De Borja told him "the MBC was happy with his earlier decision to sign a temporary restraining order (TRO) favoring Meralco." Lim, however, clarified that De Borja is not its member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/topofthehour.aspx?StoryId=127049 abs-cbnnews.com, Lopez: We don't bribe people to win cases] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jovito Salonga]], 88, Bantay Katarungan or Sentinel of Justice chair, said: “It is true that there is bribery in the CA. It should already be stopped. The bribery should be exposed. It should be the beginning of legal reforms in our system of justice. The lawyer-members and even the “student monitors” of Bantay Katarungan know who these personalities are and how the corruption works in the appellate court. They know who these people are. We, in Bantay Katarungan... have been exposing and underscoring the need for reforms in our system of justice. We have written to the Judicial and Bar Council and from time to time the appointing power on the need for reforms in specific instances not only in the CA but in the other courts.”
*Rufus Rodriguez , [[Cagayan de Oro City]] Opposition congressman and former law school dean, said: “This may be an initial black eye for the Court of Appeals...but if (Sabio) just remained silent nothing will happen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080802-152264/Corruption-in-CA-notorious--Salonga |title=inquirer.net, Corruption in CA notorious-Salonga |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000745/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080802-152264/Corruption-in-CA-notorious--Salonga |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joker Arroyo]] said: “This is a very good opportunity to clean the CA because like cancer, this is now a severe case that must not be allowed to worsen. The bribery issue involving CA Associate Justice Jose Sabio and the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) was a blessing in disguise because people would finally be made aware of what had been going on in the judiciary. We cannot just have remedial measures, we need to cleanse the CA because (corruption) has been vulgar. This is corruption right in their front door. Lawyers know all of these but the people don’t. With this scandal, it’s like a case that only lawyers talked about before had been opened. But nobody wanted to come forward because they were afraid of the justices and if nothing happened to their complaint, they would only suffer along with their cases and their clients. Now that this has been opened, it is now up to the Supreme Court to decide (what to do). Why? Because it has been criticizing corruption in the executive department, it complains against delay in the decisions of lower courts, now we have an actual case, there was an (alleged) offer to a justice. Why does (De Borja) have an unusual interest in this case? There are many who are involved. What happens now is that the SC should decide on it firmly. Once it is within the judiciary, nobody can interfere except the SC, only the SC can discipline them. We (in the Senate) cannot intervene and so (they) must resolve this.”
*Camilo Sabio, Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) Chairman, and elder brother of Justice Jose Sabio said: "The CA justice will have a “good fight. I believe he’s in the right side and I have trust in him. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s my brother. He’s a man of integrity.”
*CBCPNews, of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]], said "the Ateneo de Manila Law School found the bribery allegations against Sabio as “incredible.”
*Consumer group National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reform (Nasecore), meanwhile, said "Sabio’s revelations affirmed that Meralco does not play by the books on court and regulatory cases it is involved in. There were times in the past that we felt that Meralco had control of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) because of so many ERC rules that were patently biased in favor of the power company,. So the damning recounting made by no less than a respected justice of the Court of Appeals on how the minions of Meralco operate should give the public a very clear picture of what kind of adversary Nasecore has been facing in our lonesome in the past.” Nasecore won a S.C. case against Meralco for a refund of P827 million, on Aug. 16, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html tribune.net.ph Explain root of scandal, GSIS chief asks two justices SC urged to focus on ‘case switching’, 08/03/2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807023618/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080803hed1.html |date=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Senators, on August 12, 2008, called for the ouster or resignation of Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) Chair Camilo Sabio, for allegedly interfering with the GSIS-Meralco case handled by his brother CA Justice J. Sabio. [[Francis Escudero]] stated: Sabio “must go not only for intervening but [also] allowing a classic case of money that was stolen not once but twice.” [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] said Sabio “should explain where the Marcos money went.” [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] said: “If [Camilo Sabio] cannot clean up his own backyard, I’m wondering why he would step out of his way to intervene in the case being handled by his brother. Was he acting on his own or was he instructed by someone else?” [[Francis Pangilinan]] stated: “The act of the brother of Justice Sabio may be considered a criminal act. It appears to be an attempt to corrupt a public official under the Revised Penal Code. An investigation must be undertaken and the necessary criminal charges filed.” [[Manny Villar]] said "Sabio’s interference in the CA case was “unethical” and should be quickly looked into." [[Akbayan]] Rep. Risa Hontiveros demanded Sabio’s immediate resignation for purported violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act: “persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority. There should be no ifs or buts because he has already compromised the integrity of his office, which was ironically established to correct corruption and institute reforms for good government.” &lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;

The '''Revolutionary Mexicanist Action''' ({{lang-es|Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista}}), better known as the '''Gold shirts''' ({{lang-es|Camisas Doradas}}), was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[fascism|fascist]] paramilitary organization in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, John W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=h29VKMtmzzcC&amp;dq The Mexican right: the end of revolutionary reform, 1929-1940], p. 62, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was founded by general [[Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco]] in 1933 with the official title of ''Acción Revolucionaria Mexicana'' (Mexican Revolutionary Action). Carrasco, who had been a supporter of [[Pancho Villa]] until he deserted in 1918, named the group after the ''dorados'', Villa's "golden" group of elite soldiers. The Gold shirts opposed the reforms of president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and were protected by former president [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], who had become an enemy of Cárdenas. The Gold Shirts often violently clashed with supporters of the [[Mexican Communist Party]] and the [[Red Shirts (Mexico)|Red Shirts]] and demanded the immediate deportation of all [[Jews]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] from Mexico. Although the ''dorados'' copied their style from the [[Blackshirts]] and [[Sturmabteilung]], copying the [[anti-communism]] and [[authoritarianism]] of the former and the [[anti-Semitism]] of the latter,  they nonetheless lacked the fascist mission, being essentially (according to Fascism expert Payne) [[counterrevolutionary]] and [[reactionary]] and as such were more easily employed by the existing state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945'', London, Roultedge, 2001, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Plutarco Elías Calles#Maximato and Exile|Maximato]] era of the formerly heavily anticlerical Calles regime, the Gold shirts were moderately in favour of [[religious liberty]] for the Catholic Church, but because they still at times acted in an [[anticlericalism|anticlericalist]] way against priests wearing the [[cassock]], [[Cristeros]] never entered their ranks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Disbandment==
After Calles was deported by Cárdenas on April 9, 1936, the group lost its protector. A few months later, Rodríguez was arrested and deported to [[Texas]] in August 1936, from where he continued to lead the group until his death in 1940. After Mexico's declaration of war upon the [[Axis powers]] on May 22, 1942, the Gold shirts were banned.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== General ==
Jessop argues for conceiving governance as a provider of flexibility for decision-making structures opposed to rigid state bureaucracy or market laws. From this approach failures would equate to failures of the governance structure.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; According to him new constellations of governance may compensate for state failure.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

Peters and Pierre state that it is the continuous task of government to adapt to growing complexity.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=B. Guy|last2=Pierre|first2=Jon|title=Comparative Governance: Rediscovering the Functional Dimension of Governing|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316738177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFblDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon and Dogan write that constructive governance discourses are creative opportunities for people with disparate governance perspectives to find solutions to threatening governance failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=John|last2=Dogan|first2=Rhys|title=Hierarchies, Networks and Markets: Responses to Societal Governance Failure|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis|date=1 May 2002|volume=24|issue=1|pages=175–196|doi=10.1080/10841806.2002.11029344|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10841806.2002.11029344|accessdate=12 July 2017|issn=1084-1806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy failure ==
Governance failure may also refer to what can also be described as '''policy failures''' − the effectiveness, efficiency, and resilience of specific [[policies]].&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; A frequently mentioned example of a policy failure is the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End the Drug War|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/03/20/end-the-drug-war/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friesendorf|first1=Cornelius|title=US Foreign Policy and the War on Drugs: Displacing the Cocaine and Heroin Industry|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134123940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter|first1=Andreas,|title=A Tale of Two Borders: The U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada Lines After 9/11|journal=Center for Comparative Immigration Studies|date=22 June 2003|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6d09j0n2|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RONALD  REAGAN’S  WAR  ON  DRUGS:  A POLICY FAILURE BUT A POLITICAL SUCCESS|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/21802/Ronald%20Reagan's%20War%20on%20Drugs-A%20Policy%20Failure%20But%20a%20Political%20Success.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagley|first1=Bruce Michael|title=US Foreign Policy and the War on Drugs: Analysis of a Policy Failure|journal=Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs|date=1988|volume=30|issue=2/3|pages=189–212|doi=10.2307/165986|jstor=165986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation is a positive endeavour  including “… the preservation, maintenance, sustainable  use, restoration, and enhancement  of the natural environment”.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, UNEP and  WWF,  World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable  Development, IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protected Areas|Protected Area]] is "“...a  clearly defined geographical space,  recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means,  to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated [[ecosystem services]] and cultural values”.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N. (Editor) (2008). Guidelines for Applying Protected Area Management Categories. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. x + 86pp. {{ISBN|978-2-8317-1086-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This IUCN definition applies  equally to land, inland waters and coastal and marine territories and areas  and is widely considered  to be equivalent to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] definition.

[[Governance]] is (the process of) “…interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say…”.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J., Amos, B., Plumptre, T., 2003. Governance Principles for Protected Areas in the 21st century. Institute On Governance in collaboration with Parks Canada and Canadian International Development Agency, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; In less elegant, but possibly clearer words, governance is about taking decisions and ensuring the conditions for their effective implementation. It is the process of developing and exercising authority and responsibility over time. It is about who takes decisions, and how, including in relation to learning processes and evolving institutions in society.

Governance is related to management but different from it. What is the difference? Management is about what is done in pursuit of given objectives. Governance is about who decides about what is to be done, and how those decisions are taken. It is about who holds power, authority and responsibility and who is, or should be, held accountable. Governance is nothing new: someone, somewhere, has always  been taking decisions  about  protected and conserved areas. What is new is that we are now paying  better attention to governance, adding visibility, articulating concepts, and monitoring and evaluating  practice. There is no ideal governance setting for protected  or conserved areas, but a set of “good  governance” principles  can  always  be taken into account. Governance is appropriate only when tailored  to its specific context and effective in delivering lasting conservation  results, livelihood benefits and the respect  of rights.

== Why governance? ==
Governance can be  improved and provide precious help  in facing  on-going challenges and global change. 
* Governance is the variable  with greatest  potential  to affect conservation coverage.
* Governance is a main factor in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of management.
* Governance is a determinant  of appropriateness and equity of decisions.
* Governance can  ensure that protected  areas are better embedded in society.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, A., “Turning ideas  on their head – the new paradigm for protected  areas”, pages 1-28  in Jaireth, H. and  D. Smyth, Innovative Governance, Ane Books, Delhi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance at the IUCN World Parks Congress ==

The [[IUCN|IUCN World Parks Congress]] is held once every decade. Since the Congress in [[Durban]] (2003), governance has been a recurring stream in the deliberations of the Congress. [http://www.worldparkscongress.org/programme/stream_enhancing_the_diversity_and_quality_of_governance.html Governance] was also a major stream at the [[IUCN World Parks Congress 2014]]. The stream, among other things, published a [http://worldparkscongress.org/drupal/node/82 primer] to develop a basic lexicon in the hope that speaking “a common language” may help to better communicate and develop concepts of increasing clarity and meaning.

== Governance Diversity ==

We speak of governance  diversity for protected and conserved areas  when decisions are made by a variety of actors who enrich and strengthen conservation in practice.  For instance, a national system of protected areas  can “enhance  governance  diversity” by including in the system areas  governed by different types of actors and under different arrangements,  and/or by providing better recognition and support to conserved territories and areas  outside the system.

=== Four main governance types ===

The [[IUCN]] and [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] distinguish four broad governance types for protected and conserved areas&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention  on Biological Diversity (SCBD), Biodiversity Issues for Consideration in the Planning, Establishment and Management of Protected Area Sites and Networks, CBD Technical Series no 15,  SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; according to the actors who take or took the fundamental decisions about them (e.g. the actors that “established” them and decided their main purpose and management).
The four main governance types are:
*Type A. governance by government (at various levels and possibly combining various agencies)
*Type B. governance by various rightsholders and stakeholders together (shared governance)
*Type C. governance by private individuals and organizations (usually the landholders)
*Type D. governance by indigenous peoples and/or local communities (often referred to as ICCAs)

=== ICCAs ===

[[Indigenous and community conserved area|ICCAs]] is an abbreviation that refers to the territories and  areas conserved  by indigenous peoples  and  local communities. There are three essential characteristics common to ICCAs:&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  B. Lassen, S. Stevens, G. Martin, JC Riasco de la Peña,  E. Raéz Luna and M.T. Farvar, Bio-cultural Diversity Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples &amp; Local Communities: Examples &amp; Analysis,  IUCN, UNDP GEF SGP, GIZ and  CENESTA, Tehran, 2010 (reprinted  2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, A. with C. Corrigan, H. Jonas,  A. Neumann, and  H. Shrumm (eds.), Recognising  and Supporting  Territories and Areas Conserved  by Indigenous  Peoples And  Local Communities: Global  Overview and National  Case  Studies,  CBD Technical Series no. 64,  Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, ICCA Consortium, IUCN/TILCEPA, Kalpavriksh and  Natural Justice, SCBD, Montreal  (Canada), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* an indigenous people  or local community possesses a close and  profound  relation with a site (territory, area or habitat)
* the people  or community is the major player  in decision- making related  to the site and  has de facto and/or de jure capacity to develop  and  enforce  regulations
* the people’s or community’s decisions and efforts lead to the conservation of biodiversity, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless  of original or primary motivations

Management categories and governance types are independent and can be juxtaposed in the “IUCN Matrix”,&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N.,  Guidelines  for Applying Protected Area Management Categories, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; visualizing a spectrum of area-based options to conserve nature in a given region/ system. The IUCN Matrix can be used to situate protected areas but also conserved territories and areas (the management category, in such case, would not correspond to a key objective but to an observed result).

Conservation depends on well governed systems of protected  and  conserved  areas in the landscape and  seascape and systems  are  made  stronger  by governance  diversity.

=== Conserved Territories or Areas ===
Conserved  territories or areas are  “…area-based measure  that— regardless of recognition  and dedication and  at times even regardless of explicit and  conscious  management practices—  achieve conservation de facto and/or is in a positive conservation trend and  likely to maintain this trend in the long term…”.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press)&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition applies  equally to land,  inland  waters  and coastal  and  marine territories and  areas.
The governance types apply  to both protected  areas and  conserved territories and  areas that are  NOT recognised as “protected” by the IUCN or any specific national  government.  In this sense,  the terms “Privately Conserved  Areas”  and  “ICCAs” encompass extents of land, inland waters and  coastal  and  marine  territories and  areas that go beyond  those recognised as “protected” by either national  government  or the IUCN.

===Voluntary and ancillary conservation===
Many systems of land and  water  management support high levels of biodiversity,  including critical biodiversity,  outside the formal system of protected  areas, in sites such a tourism and commercial hunting reserves,  private  estates  or village forests. The term voluntary  conservation &lt;ref&gt;Lausche, B. and  F. Burhenne,  Guidelines  for Protected Area Legislation, IUCN, Gland (Switzerland),  2011&lt;/ref&gt; captures the idea  that those who exercise governance do so consciously and  without restriction, in ways that are  fully compatible with conserving biodiversity values while they may or not see conservation as the primary objective  of their management efforts. In other cases, as in military no-go areas or areas abandoned after a natural or man-made  disaster,  the term ancillary conservation is more appropriate, since conservation is an entirely unintended (though welcome) consequence of management for other purposes.
Conservation in the landscape and  seascape is the result of various area-based and  non-area- based measures. Among area-based measures  we find both protected  areas and  conserved territories and areas. Crucially, those should be biologically,  but also socially, well connected.

===Systems of protected  and conserved  areas===
A well-functioning  system of  protected   and  conserved  areas is complete and well-connected in conserving  the representative features  and  functions of nature  in a given environment.

===Other effective area- based conservation measures (OECMs)===
The term “other effective area-based conservation measures”– abbreviated as OECMs—is used by the Convention on Biological Diversity to refer to territories and areas that are  effectively conserved but not part of the official protected  area system of a given country. In this sense,  OECMs can  be seen as “clearly defined  geographical space where  de facto conservation of nature  and  associated ecosystem services and  cultural values is achieved and  expected to be maintained in the long-term regardless of specific recognition  and  dedication”  (11). OECMs can include the following:
* Primary voluntary conservation that the national  government  does  not wish to recognise as a protected  area
* Primary voluntary conservation that refuses the protected  area label and/or inclusion in the national  system (e.g.  because of self- determination  and  self-governance  issues)
* Secondary voluntary conservation
* Ancillary conservation with a reasonable expectation to be maintained in the long-term
The following Table summarises  various ways of classifying conservation efforts and  results:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Conserved  areas (conserved de facto with a reasonable expectation that conservation will be maintained in the long term) !! Conservation  of nature  is the primary management objective !! Conservation  of nature  is not the primary management objective
|-
| The State government recognizes  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected  area both according to the IUCN and  in the country at stake || The area is a protected area in the country at stake, although  not internationally; it likely comprises  voluntary conservation; it can  comprise ancillary conservation; it can be considered an OECM from an international  point 
|-
| The State government does not recognize  it as part of its system of protected  areas || The area is a protected area according to the IUCN (but not recognized as such nationally); the area most likely comprises  voluntary conservation; the IUCN recommends to nationally consider  it as an OECM
 || The area is neither recognized as a protected area nationally  nor internationally;  it likely comprises  voluntary conservation and/or ancillary conservation; the area can  be considered nationally  as an OECM

==Governance quality==

===IUCN principles  of good governance for protected  areas===
We  speak  of governance quality when decisions  are  made  while respecting the “good governance” principles developed through time by a variety of peoples, nations  and  UN agencies. A simple and compact  formulation of the “IUCN principles  of good  governance for protected  areas”,&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt;  includes:

* Legitimacy and  voice— i.e. enjoying broad acceptance and appreciation in society; ensuring procedural rights of access  to information, participation  and justice; fostering engagement and  diversity; preventing  discrimination; fostering subsidiarity, mutual respect,  dialogue, consensus  and  agreed rules…
* Direction— i.e. following an inspiring and  consistent strategic  vision grounded on agreed values and  an appreciation of complexities; ensuring consistency with policy and practice  at various levels; ensuring clear answers  to contentious questions;  ensuring proper  [[adaptive management]] and  favouring the emergence of champions  and  tested innovations…
* Performance—i.e. achieving  conservation  and  other objectives as planned; promoting a culture of learning;  engaging in advocacy and  outreach;  being  responsive  to the needs  of rightsholders  and  stakeholders; ensuring resources  and  capacities and  their efficient use; promoting sustainability and  resilience…
* Accountability—i.e.  upholding  integrity and  commitment; ensuring appropriate access  to information and  transparency, including for lines of responsibility, allocation of resources,  and  evaluation  of performances; establishing  communication avenues  and encouraging feed-back  and  independent overseeing…
* Fairness and rights—i.e. striving towards equitably shared costs and benefits, without adverse impact for vulnerable people; upholding decency and the dignity of all; being fair, impartial, consistent, non discriminatory, respectful of procedural rights as well as substantive rights, individual and collective human rights, gender equity and the rights of indigenous peoples, including Free, Prior and Informed Consent; promoting local empowerment in conservation…

Thus, a “good governance” situation is one in which decisions  are  taken legitimately, competently,  fairly, with sense  of vision, accountability and  while respecting rights.

===Equitable and effective governance===
The IUCN good  governance situation can  also be summed up as “equitable and  effective governance”. The criteria of legitimacy,  voice, fairness and  (procedural and  substantive) rights contribute to equitable governance. The criteria of direction,  performance and  accountability lead  to governance that is effective.

===Substantive and  procedural rights===
Rights are  usefully distinguished  between substantive and  procedural. Procedural  rights, such as the rights to information,  participation and  access to justice, govern the process  of determining  and adjudicating substantive rights. In turn, substantive rights refer
to the specific powers  and  obligations of individuals and  collective bodies  under accepted customs and legislation.  They span  from basic human  rights (e.g. life, liberty) to material  and  financial rights under specific contractual conditions  (e.g.  access  to a given territory). Procedural  and  substantive rights deserve  respect  in relation to both protected
and  conserved areas and  territories

==Governance vitality==
We  speak  of governance vitality when decision-making actors and  institutions are functional, responsive and  thriving, meeting their role and  responsibilities in timely and appropriate ways. Vitality is expressed  by several of these properties:

* Integration and  connectivity —i.e. having abundant and  meaningful interactions with diverse actors, sectors and  levels of decision-making in society, including those interactions that characterise a system versus scattered  and  isolated single protected  areas, and those interactions that render  decisions effective through the generation of political, social and financial support…
* Adaptability –i.e. being reflexive and  flexible, able to accommodate circumstances, integrate knowledge  from different cultures, learn from experience and  weigh options through dialogue, exchanges, experiment and  debate…  able to take rapid  and  meaningful decisions even under challenging  circumstances...
* Wisdom —i.e. being aware  and respectful of the socio-ecological history and traditional worldviews, knowledge  and  values of the relevant environment and  communities; governing situations of meaningful scope  (e.g. regarding the size and  coherence of the units to manage, the number of actors to involve…) and  in line with solidarity rather than self-interest only (e.g. sharing benefits, avoiding  accumulation  and  waste,  keeping  in mind future generations); not only allowing, but fostering the engagement of as many relevant actors in society as possible…
* Innovation and  creativity — i.e. openness  to new ideas,  ability to re-invent and  renew itself as only a living system does,  ability to conceive and  implement new solutions, support the emergence of new rules and  norms, respond  positively to change and continue to develop…
* Empowerment  – i.e. being self-conscious, self-directed, willing and  capable of demonstrating leadership, such as by organizing timely responses  to emerging  environmental conditions, problems and opportunities… but also being self-disciplined and  self-critical, able to take on responsibilities in effective and  dependable ways…
 
While governance diversity and  quality have  been  explored rather  exhaustively,  the concept of governance vitality has only recently been  identified for further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G. and  R. Hill , “Governance for the conservation of nature”,  in Worboys, G. L., M. Lockwood, A. Kothari, S. Feary and  I. Pulsford (eds), Protected Area Governance and Management, ANU Press, Canberra, 2014 (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;  All governance properties  are  open  to enrichment and  debate.

==How does  governance improve?==
The IUCN and  CBD have recently published a volume of Guidelines for assessing,  evaluating  and planning  for action with a view to improving governance for a system of protected  areas or a specific site.&lt;ref&gt;Borrini-Feyerabend, G.,  N. Dudley, T. Jaeger, B. Lassen, N. Pathak Broome, A. Phillips and  T. Sandwith,  Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to action, Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines  Series No.  20,  IUCN, Gland  (Switzerland),  2013&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases,  the methodology  begins with an analysis of the historical, socio-cultural, institutional and  legal contexts. It then proceeds with a spatial analysis of governance vis-à-vis the status of conservation of nature.  This requires a large,  territorial view of the region or area  under consideration, including an assessment of biological,  ecological  and  cultural values and  their potential association  with governance diversity, quality and  vitality. From that, valuable  lessons can be derived and  action plans for improvement can be drawn.

Globally, there remains a need to initiate such systematic governance assessments and evaluations processes in a range of contexts, with the aim and expectation that they will catalyze enhanced  diversity, quality and vitality. A structured programme of governance  assessments, supported by learning and capacity development networks is a short and medium term priority to strengthen both conservation policies and results.

{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}
A '''government''' is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press|date=November 2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[judiciary]]. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining [[policy]]. Each government has a kind of [[constitution]], a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual [[freedom]] and the idea of absolute state authority ([[tyranny]]).

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], [[theocracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being [[election|electoral contest]] and [[hereditary succession]].

==Definitions and etymology==

A government is the [[system]] to [[Governance|govern]] a [[state (polity)|state]] or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|date=2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''government'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'' with [[Gubernaculum (classical)|gubernaculum]] (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in [[Plato]]'s [[Ship of State]]).&lt;ref name="britannica1911"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as "a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Columbia University Press | title=Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th edition |year=2000| title-link=Columbia Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as their subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the word ''government'' is also used more narrowly to refer to the [[ministry (collective executive)]], a collective group of people that exercises [[executive (government)|executive authority]] in a state{{cn|date=September 2017}} or, metonymically, to the governing [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] as part of the executive.

Finally, ''government'' is also sometimes used in English as a [[synonym]] for [[governance]].

==History==
{{main|Political history of the world|Political philosophy}}

The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and the [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Yellow River Civilization]].{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=294}}

The development of [[agriculture]] and [[water control]] projects were a catalyst for the development of governments.&lt;ref name="brittanica2010"&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica (15th edition)&lt;/ref&gt; For many thousands of years when people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and small scale farmers, humans lived in small, non-hierarchical and [[self-sufficient]] communities.{{cn|date=October 2017}} On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council. The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture,{{sfn|Christian|2004|pp=146–147}} and that allowed for ever increasing population densities.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments:&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field.|David Christian, p. 245|&lt;u&gt;Maps of Time&lt;/u&gt;}}

Starting at the end of the [[17th century]], the prevalence of [[republic|republican forms]] of government grew. The [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The [[Soviet Union]] was the first large country to have a [[Communist]] government.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences /&gt; Since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[liberal democracy]] has become an even more prevalent form of government.&lt;ref name="Kuper" /&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|isbn=978-0-19-957967-9|title=The Oxford Handbook of State and Local Government|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the regulation of [[corporations]] and the development of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Kuper"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|editor=Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-47635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political science==
=== Classifying government ===
In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of [[polities]], as typologies of political systems are not obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Lewellen, Ted C. ''Political Anthropology: An Introduction Third Edition''. Praeger Publishers; 3rd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important in the [[political science]] fields of [[comparative politics]] and [[international relations]]. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.

Superficially, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a [[Federal republic|constitutional republic]], while the former Soviet Union was a [[socialist republic]]. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative politics : interests, identities, and institutions in a changing global order'', Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach (eds.), 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521708400}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[election]]s are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} but in practice elections in the former Soviet Union were not "free and fair" and took place in a [[one-party state]]. [[Voltaire]] argued that "the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire | journal=Michigan Academician | last1=Renna | first1=Thomas | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=60–75 | doi=10.7245/0026-2005-42.1.60 | date=Sep 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments that officially call themselves a "[[democratic republic]]" are not democratic, nor a republic; they are usually a dictatorship ''[[de facto]]''. Communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term. For example, the official name of North Vietnam was "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam". China uses a variant, "The People's Republic of China". Thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic.

Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many [[political systems]] originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by [[political party|parties]] naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate "distortion or bias" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of "[[conservatism]]" in the [[United States]] has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls [[liberalism]] or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives, and they played a key role in the [[Conservative Coalition]] that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-political ambiguity===
Every country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Additionally, opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. "Shades of gray" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for "[[pigeonholing]]" governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the [[Plutocracy#United States|United States as being a plutocracy]] rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy [[Super PACs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html "Plutocrats – The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407045309/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dialectical forms of government ===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}
The [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] discusses five types of regimes: [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.

==Forms of government==
{{main list|List of forms of government}}

One method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule.  This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).

The division of governments as monarchy, aristocracy and democracy has been used since Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  In his book [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] expands on this classification.

{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy. Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;{{cite wikisource|author=Hobbes, Thomas|title=Leviathan|wslink=Leviathan/The Second Part}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Autocracy===
An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme [[Power (social and political)|power]] is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [[coup d'état]] or mass [[insurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms|author=Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[despotism]] is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in an [[autocracy]], or it may be a group, as in an [[oligarchy]]. The word despotism means to "rule in the fashion of despots".{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[monarchy]] is where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Aristocracy===
Aristocracy ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία ''aristokratía'', from  ἄριστος ''[[Wikt:aristocrat#English|aristos]]'' "excellent", and κράτος ''[[Wikt:kratos|kratos]]'' "[[Power (social and political)|power]]") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged [[ruling class]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=December 1989 |title=Aristocracy |trans_title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022358/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Monarchy|monarchies]] were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power. The term "Aristocracy" could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the [[Feudalism|Feudal system]].   

An oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some historical examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republic]]s. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States as an oligarchy]]. The [[Athenian democracy]] used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[theocracy]] is rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity.  [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government]]'s (see [[Dalai Lama]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Democracy===
In a general sense, in a [[democracy]], all the people of a [[state (polity)|state]] or [[polity]] are involved in making decisions about its affairs. Also refer to the rule by a government chosen by election where most of the populace are enfranchised. The key distinction between a democracy and other forms of constitutional government is usually taken to be that the right to vote is not limited by a person's wealth or race (the main qualification for enfranchisement is usually having reached a certain age). A democratic government is, therefore, one supported (at least at the time of the election) by a [[majority]] of the populace (provided the election was held fairly). A "majority" may be defined in different ways. There are many "power-sharing" (usually in countries where people mainly identify themselves by race or religion) or "electoral-college" or "constituency" systems where the government is not chosen by a simple one-vote-per-person headcount.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In democracies, large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Commonly significant in democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[Liberal democracy]] is a variant of democracy. It is a [[form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[liberalism]]. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]], [[Spain]], or the [[United Kingdom]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], [[Portugal]], or [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], New Zealand, or the [[United Kingdom]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Republics ===
A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" (Latin: ''res publica''), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited.  The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montesquieu]] included both [[democracy|democracies]], where all the people have a share in rule, and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used to describe different republics include [[Democratic republic]], [[Parliamentary republic]], [[Federal republic]], and [[Islamic Republic]].

== Scope of government ==
Rule by [[authoritarian]] governments is identified in societies where a specific set of people possess the authority of the state in a [[republic]] or union. It is a [[political system]] controlled by unelected rulers who usually permit some degree of [[individual freedom]]. Rule by a [[totalitarian]] government is characterised by a highly centralised and coercive authority that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In contrast, a constitutional republic is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal constitution, and chosen by a vote amongst at least some sections of the populace (Ancient Sparta was in its own terms a republic, though most inhabitants were disenfranchised). Republics that exclude sections of the populace from participation will typically claim to represent all citizens (by defining people without the vote as "non-citizens"). Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Federalism ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
Federalism is a political concept in which a ''group'' of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: ''foedus'', [[wikt:covenant|covenant]]) with a governing [[federal headship|representative head]]. The term "federalism" is also used to describe a system of government in which [[sovereignty]] is [[constitution]]ally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a [[federation]]. Proponents are often called [[federalist]]s.

== Economic systems ==
{{further|Economic system}}
Historically, most political systems originated as [[socioeconomic]] [[economic ideology|ideologies]]. Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

| [[Capitalism]] || A social-economic system in which the [[means of production]] (machines, tools, factories, etc.) are under private ownership and their use is for profit.
|-
| [[Communism]] || A social-economic system in which means of production are commonly owned (either by the people directly, through the [[Commune (socialism)|commune]] or by [[communist society]]), and production is undertaken [[Production for use|for use]], rather than [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|for profit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 66|quote= Marx distinguishes between two phases of marketless communism: an initial phase, with labor vouchers, and a higher phase, with free access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Busky|first= Donald F.|title= Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey|publisher= Praeger|date=July 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0275968861|page = 4|quote=Communism would mean free distribution of goods and services.

|-
| [[Feudalism]] || A social-economic system of land ownership and duties. Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom was the king's. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.

Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): "Virtually all (democratic) socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with 'socialism,' i.e. the Soviet model of a non-market, centrally-planned economy...Some have endorsed the concept of 'market socialism,' a post-capitalist economy that retains market competition, but socializes the means of production, and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a non-market, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public service]]s would be [[common ownership|commonly]], [[collective ownership|collectively]], or [[state ownership|state owned]], such as [[Universal health care|healthcare]] and [[Universal access to education|education]].
|-
| [[Statism]] || A social-economic system that concentrates power in the state at the expense of individual freedom. Among other variants, the term subsumes theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, authoritarian socialism, and plain, unadorned dictatorship. Such variants differ on matters of form, tactics and ideology.
|-
| [[Welfare state]] || A social-economic system in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of [[equality of opportunity]], equitable [[distribution of wealth]], and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life.

[[File:World Health Organisation building from west.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].]]

'''Health policy''' can be defined as the "decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific [[healthcare]] goals within a society".&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_policy/en/ ''Health Policy''], accessed 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], an explicit health policy can achieve several things: it defines a vision for the future; it outlines priorities and the expected roles of different groups; and it builds consensus and informs people.&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"/&gt;

There are many categories of health policies, including global health policy, public health policy, mental health policy, health care services policy, [[insurance policy]], personal healthcare policy, [[pharmaceutical policy]], and policies related to [[public health]] such as [[vaccination policy]], [[Tobacco smoking#Public policy|tobacco control policy]] or [[breastfeeding promotion]] policy. They may cover topics of financing and delivery of healthcare, access to care, quality of care, and [[HealthEquity|health equity.]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/about ''About Health Care Policy''], accessed 25 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Health-related policy and its implementation is complex. Conceptual models can help show the flow from health-related policy development to health-related policy and program implementation and to [[health system]]s and health outcomes. Policy should be understood as more than a national law or health policy that supports a program or intervention. Operational policies are the rules, regulations, guidelines, and administrative norms that governments use to translate national laws and policies into programs and services.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, H, N Jewell and Karen Hardee.  2001. [http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/occasional/op-7.pdf ''Reforming Operational Policies:  A Pathway to Improving Reproductive Health Programs''] POLICY Occasional Paper. No. 7.  Washington DC: The Futures Group International, POLICY Project&lt;/ref&gt; The policy process encompasses decisions made at a national or decentralized level (including funding decisions) that affect whether and how services are delivered. Thus, attention must be paid to policies at multiple levels of the health system and over time to ensure sustainable scale-up. A supportive policy environment will facilitate the scale-up of health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hardee, L. Ashford, E. Rottach, R. Jolivet, and R. Kiesel. 2012. [http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/index.cfm?ID=publications&amp;get=pubID&amp;pubID=83 ''The Policy Dimensions of Scaling Up Health Initiatives'']. Washington, DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many topics in the [[politics]] and [[evidence]] that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy. [[Evidence-based policy]] relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Most political debates surround personal health care policies, especially those that seek to [[health care reform|reform healthcare delivery]], and can typically be categorized as either [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[economics|economic]]. Philosophical debates center around questions about [[individual rights]], ethics and government authority, while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costs.

The modern concept of healthcare involves access to [[health care provider|medical professionals]] from various fields as well as [[medical technology]], such as [[medication]]s and [[surgical instrument|surgical equipment]]. It also involves access to the latest information and evidence from research, including [[medical research]] and [[health services research]].

In many countries it is left to the individual to gain access to healthcare goods and services by paying for them directly as [[out-of-pocket expenses]], and to private sector players in the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries to develop research. Planning and production of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] is distributed among labour market participants.

Other countries have an explicit policy to ensure and support access for all of its citizens, to fund health research, and to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet healthcare goals. Many governments around the world have established [[universal health care]], which takes the burden of healthcare expenses off of private businesses or individuals through pooling of financial risk.  There are a variety of arguments for and against universal healthcare and related health policies. Healthcare is an important part of [[health systems]] and therefore it often accounts for one of the largest areas of spending for both [[government]]s and individuals all over the world.

== Personal healthcare policy options ==

=== Philosophy: right to health ===
{{See also|Philosophy of healthcare}}

Many countries and jurisdictions integrate a [[human rights]] philosophy in directing their healthcare policies. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that every country in the world is party to at least one human rights [[treaty]] that addresses health-related rights, including the [[right to health]] as well as other rights that relate to conditions necessary for good health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/hhr/en/ ''Health and Human Rights''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) asserts that medical care is a right of all people:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''.] Adopted on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UDHR]] Article 25:'' "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, illness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

In some jurisdictions and among different [[faith-based organizations]], health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances, including the sick. Other jurisdictions and [[non-governmental organization]]s draw on the principles of [[humanism]] in defining their health policies, asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined [[right to health]].&lt;ref name="NHCHC"&gt;National Health Care for the Homeless Council.[http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html "Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610180442/http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does it Mean?"] October 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the worldwide human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has focused on [[health]] as a human right, addressing inadequate access to [[HIV]] drugs and women's [[reproductive health|sexual and reproductive]] rights including wide disparities in [[maternal mortality]] within and across countries. Such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = The Lancet | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60768-X | title = Half a century of Amnesty International | journal = The Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21621708 | pmc = | url    =  http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains considerable controversy regarding policies on who would be paying the costs of medical care for all people and under what circumstances. For example, government spending on healthcare is sometimes used as a global indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people.&lt;ref name="LANCET"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = M. T. | last3 = Gubbins | first3 = P. | last4 = Leach-Kemon | first4 = K. | last5 = Jamison | first5 = D. | last6 = Murray | first6 = C.

The argument furthers that universal health insurance denies the right of individual patients to dispose of their own income as per their own will.&lt;ref name="Sade"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sade | first1 = R. M. | title = Medical Care as a Right: A Refutation | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197112022852304 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 285 | issue = 23 | pages = 1288–1292 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5113728 | pmc = }} (Reprinted as [http://www.aapsonline.org/brochures/sademcr.htm "The Political Fallacy that Medical Care is a Right."])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3057 ''Universal Health Care Won't Work – Witness Medicare.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in the rights debate is governments' use of legislation to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national [[social insurance]] systems, such as the case in [[Canada's national health insurance program]]. [[Laissez-faire]] supporters argue that this erodes the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the health system, as even those who can afford to pay for private healthcare services drain resources from the public system.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner MD.

Another claim in the United States perceives government over-regulation of the healthcare and insurance industries as the effective end of charitable home visits from doctors among the poor and elderly.&lt;ref name="David E.

===Economics: healthcare financing===
Many types of health policies exist focusing on the financing of healthcare services to spread the economic risks of ill health. These include [[publicly funded health care]] (through taxation or insurance, also known as single-payer systems), mandatory or voluntary private [[health insurance]], and complete [[rights issue|capitalization]] of personal health care services through private companies, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kereiakes | first1 = D.

[http://www.who.int/health_financing/en/ ''Health financing policy''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing on which type of health financing policy results in better or worse quality of healthcare services provided, and how to ensure allocated funds are used effectively, efficiently and [[health equity|equitably]].

There are many arguments on both sides of the issue of public versus private health financing policies:

'''''Claims that publicly funded healthcare improves the quality and efficiency of personal health care delivery:'''''
* Government spending on health is essential for the accessibility and sustainability of healthcare services and programmes.&lt;ref name="LANCET"/&gt;
* For those people who would otherwise go without care due to lack of financial means, any quality care is an improvement.
* Since people perceive universal healthcare as ''free'' (if there is no insurance premium or co-payment), they are more likely to seek [[preventive care]] which may reduce the disease burden and overall healthcare costs in the long run.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Single-payer systems reduce wastefulness by removing the middle man, i.e. private insurance companies, thus reducing the amount of bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;William F May. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=106 "The Ethical Foundations of Health Care Reform."] ''The Christian Century'', June 1–8, 1994, pp. 572–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reducing the amount of paperwork that medical professionals have to deal with for insurance claims processing allows them to concentrate more on treating [[patient]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''''Claims that privately funded healthcare leads to greater quality and efficiencies in personal health care:'''''
* Perceptions that publicly funded healthcare is ''free'' can lead to overuse of medical services, and hence raise overall costs compared to private health financing.&lt;ref&gt;

* Privately funded medicine leads to greater quality and efficiencies through increased access to and reduced waiting times for specialized health care services and technologies.&lt;ref name="Sade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;Goodman, John.

''The Machinery of Freedom.'' Arlington House Publishers: New York, 1978. pp. 65–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Limiting the allocation of public funds for personal healthcare does not curtail the ability of uninsured citizens to pay for their healthcare as [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Public funds can be better rationalized to provide [[emergency care]] services regardless of insured status or ability to pay, such as with the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Privately funded and operated healthcare reduces the requirement for governments to increase taxes to cover healthcare costs, which may be compounded by the inefficiencies among government agencies due to their greater bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute.

== Other health policy options ==
Health policy options extend beyond the financing and delivery of personal health care, to domains such as [[medical research]] and [[health workforce]] planning, both domestically and internationally.

=== Medical research policy ===
[[Medical research]] can be both the basis for defining evidence-based health policy, and the subject of health policy itself, particularly in terms of its sources of funding. Those in favor of government policies for publicly funded medical research posit that removing profit as a motive will increase the rate of medical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the recent discovery that dichloroacetate (DCA) can cause regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain tumors.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/17/cancer-chemo.html Alberta scientists test chemotherapy alternative Last Updated: Wednesday, January 17, 2007]  The DCA compound is not patented or owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added.  The bad news, is that while DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials.[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 University of Alberta – Small molecule offers big hope against cancer. January 16, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227080213/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those opposed argue that it will do the opposite, because removing the incentive of profit removes incentives to innovate and inhibits new technologies from being developed and utilized.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller RL |author2=DK Benjamin |author3=DC North |title=The Economics of Public Issues |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2003 |isbn=0321118731 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidence-based policymaking. For example, in South Africa, whose population sets the record for [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV infections]], previous government policy limiting funding and access for AIDS treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs Aids forum."] ''BBC News'', 10 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A change of government eventually led to a change in policy, with new policies implemented for widespread access to HIV services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV and AIDS in South Africa."] ''Avert''. Accessed 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue relates to [[intellectual property]], as illustrated by the case of Brazil, where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in violation of [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil#Drug patents|drug patents]].

=== Health workforce policy ===
{{Main|Health workforce}}
Some countries and jurisdictions have an explicit policy or strategy to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] to meet healthcare goals, such as to address [[physician supply|physician]] and [[nursing shortage]]s. Elsewhere, workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants as a [[laissez-faire]] approach to health policy. Evidence-based policies for workforce development are typically based on findings from [[health services research]].

=== Health in foreign policy ===
Many governments and agencies include a health dimension in their [[foreign policy]] in order to achieve [[global health]] goals. Promoting health in lower income countries has been seen as instrumental to achieve other goals on the global agenda, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kickbusch | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3154 | title = Global health diplomacy: How foreign policy can influence health | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3154 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21665931 | pmc = |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21665931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promoting [[global security]] – linked to fears of global [[pandemic]]s, the intentional spread of [[pathogen]]s, and a potential increase in humanitarian conflicts, natural disasters, and emergencies;
* Promoting [[economic development]] – including addressing the economic effect of poor health on development, of pandemic outbreaks on the global market place, and also the gain from the growing global market in health goods and services;
* Promoting [[social justice]] – reinforcing health as a social value and human right, including supporting the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global health policy ===
Global health policy encompasses the global governance structures that create the policies underlying public health throughout the world. In addressing [[global health]], global health policy "implies consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of particular nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15961">The '''Investment theory of party competition''' is a [[political theory]] developed by [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]], Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The theory focuses on how business elites, not voters, play the leading part in political systems. The theory offers an alternative to the conventional, voter-focused, [[realignment election#Realignment theory|Voter Realignment theory]] and [[Median voter theorem]], which has been criticized by Ferguson and others.

==History==
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' was first outlined by Thomas Ferguson in his 1983 paper ''Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective|journal=Research in Political Economy|date=1983|volume=6|pages=1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is detailed most extensively in Ferguson's 1995 book ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-driven Political Systems'', in which his earlier paper is republished as a chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Golden Rule : The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226243176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ferguson frames his theory as being both inspired by and an alternative to the traditional median voter theories of democracy such as that posited by [[Anthony Downs]] in his 1957 work ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Downs, Ferguson accepts that 'the expense of political awareness is so great that no citizen can afford to bear it in every policy area, even if by doing so he could discover places where his intervention would reap large profits'. While Downs largely overlooked the implications of this insight, Ferguson makes it the foundation of the ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'', recognizing that if voters cannot bear the cost of becoming informed about public affairs they have little hope of successfully supervising government.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The real market for political parties is defined by major investors, who generally have good and clear reason for investing to control the [[Sovereign state|state]]....Blocs of major investors define the core of political parties and are responsible for most of the [[Political campaign|signals the party sends to the electorate]].|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.206&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The central claim of the ''Investment Theory'' is that since ordinary citizens cannot afford to acquire the information required to invest in political parties, the political system will be dominated by those who can. As a result, the investment theory holds that rather than being seen as simple vote maximizers, political parties are best analyzed as blocs of investors who coalesce to advance candidates representing their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of political parties===
Contrary to the median voter theorem where political parties have traditionally been seen as vote maximizers who will seek out the position of the 'median voter' on any particular issue, the ''Investment Theory'' holds the real area of competition for political parties is major investors who have an interest in investing to control the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, in situations where money is important, political parties must take positions that enable them to attract the investment required to run successful campaigns. This is the case even if those positions are not supported by the majority of the population, since it is futile for a party to adopt even a popular position if it cannot afford the expense of communicating that position to the electorate in an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the ''Investment theory'' predicts that in many cases political parties are more likely to try and change the position of the public to match those of its investors than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead political parties will try to assemble the votes they need through appeals to the electorate on issues that do not conflict with the interests of their investors. Vigorous debate may take place on issues where an opposing bloc of investors is able to mobilize and advertise their position. A further consequence of this theory is that in policy areas where large investors agree on policy, no party competition will take place. This is the case regardless of the views of the general population, unless ordinary citizens are able to become major investors in their own right through expenditure of time and income.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of ordinary voters===
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' does not deny the possibility that masses of voters can become major investors in an electoral system, and accepts that in cases where this does happen the effect may resemble classical voter competition models. For this to happen, however, generally requires channels that facilitate mass deliberation and expression, typically 'secondary' organizations capable of spreading the cost of acquiring information and concentrating contributions from many individuals to act politically. Such conditions may enable high information flows to the general population and make political debate and action a part of everyday life. Where these conditions do not exist, however, it is unlikely that ordinary citizens will be able to afford the costs required to control policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The electorate is not too stupid or too tired to control the political system. It is merely too poor.|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A consequence of the ''Investment Theory'' is that it is not necessary to assume that the voting population is stupid or malevolent to explain why it will often vote for parties whose policies are opposed to their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ferguson suggests, the general population is far from ignorant or uninterested in the outcome of elections, and will often make considerable effort to understand the issues under discussion. Voting decisions ultimately, however, must be made on the basis of the information that is available, and if acquiring information is expensive in terms of time or money then most likely those decisions will be made on the basis of information subsidized by wealthy investors.

===The role of wealthy investors===
According to Ferguson, who credits the insight to Downs, one of the reasons that wealthy investors are able to influence politics to their advantage is that much of the politically relevant information that is so expensive for ordinary citizens to acquire comes quite naturally to businesses in the course of their daily operations. An example might include international banks whose business contacts constitute 'a first-rate foreign policy network'.

Similarly, economies of scale give businesses an advantage over ordinary voters. For example, large investors will routinely consult with lawyers, public relations advisors, lobbyists, and political consultants before acting. The cost of this advice is prohibitively expensive for most citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since investors cannot guarantee the outcome of an election or know exactly what policies a candidate will implement once in power, they must estimate the chances their investment will be successful. In some cases, this may lead to investors supporting more than one candidate, perhaps in more than one party. In other cases, it is expected that an investor will judge that one party will never accept its desired policies and so will become the 'core' of one party. Ferguson cites the support of labor-intensive industries such as textiles and steel supporting the Republican party after the New Deal as an example, owing to their labor policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Investment Theory'' recognizes the importance of financial contributions to political parties, Ferguson notes that direct cash contributions 'are probably not the most important way in which truly top business figures ("major investors") act politically'. Investors are also likely to act as sources of contacts, fundraisers, and as sources of legitimation for candidates, particularly through endorsements in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the theory does not predict that elections will be won by the party that is able to spend the most money. Instead, it suggests that while parties will likely need to attract significant resources in order to be able to mount a successful campaign, they do not necessarily need to attract the ''most'' money.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to other election theories===

The ''Investment Theory'' makes a number of novel predictions compared to other theories of party systems.

==Case Studies==

===The New Deal===
Ferguson uses the Investment Theory as the basis of an analysis of the [[New Deal]] in his 1984 paper "From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression", in which he argues that the New Deal policies became possible due to the changing nature of the American economy and the new coalitions of political investors that emerged as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression|journal=International Organization|date=1984|volume=38|issue=1|pages=41–94|url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/ferguson.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2016|doi=10.1017/s0020818300004276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson argues that in the early years of the twentieth century American politics was dominated by a coalition of labor-intensive industries including steel, coal, and textiles, who opposed labor, and protectionist industries who supported the Republican Party. These industries were also joined by finance, who largely shared the support for trade tariffs and aggressive foreign policy. This coalition first began to split after the first world war as successful capital-intensive firms such as [[Standard Oil]] and [[General Electric]] began to emerge for whom labor issues were less pressing and who favored lower tariffs to stimulate world trade and open new markets. International banks also moved away from protectionist policies, as post-war recovery required European nations to export to America and required US banks to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1984 p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

These firms went on to form the coalition that backed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies, as their dominant position in the world economy made them the primary beneficiaries of the New Deal's free trade policies. While these new multinational corporations were better able to tolerate the pro-labour policies of the New Deal, they did not necessarily support it. Instead, Ferguson credits the rise of independent industrial unionism as the result of masses of American voters for the first time in US history successfully pooling their resources to become major investors in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign Finance Reform==
Although the 'Investment Theory' is largely concerned with financial donations to political parties, Ferguson argues that the theory implies reform must look beyond campaign finance alone. While acknowledging a need for reform of campaign finance, 'if only to prevent more and more of society's resources going down a black hole', Ferguson suggests, that no matter how diligent the regulators are, wealthy investors will doubtless find new ways to corrupt the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, since the problem of money influencing politics stems from the cost of information, Ferguson argues the solution might come from finding ways for regular citizens to share these costs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since it is inefficient for individuals or even groups of individuals to cope with this problem on an individual basis, Ferguson proposes that the cost must be subsidized by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the United States (and other nations) already subsidize some of these costs, for example in providing public finance to political parties, franking mail or providing staff to politicians, this rarely takes place on a scale that actually does the public any good. Instead, this funding merely subsidizes parties that the rich control, with the effect that public money merely leverages the contributions of major investors.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, then, is to apply the 'Golden Rule' to ordinary citizens by providing enough public support to allow ordinary members of the public to run for office and have a reasonable chance of winning. This would not only allow ordinary citizens and (seemingly) heterodox opinions to be heard but would also have the effect of limiting the harm that private financing can have.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-093-65, Flüchtlinge auf Schiff.jpg|thumbnail|[[Refugees from Königsberg]] fleeing to western Germany before the advancing Red Army in 1945]]
Kaliningrad, or [[Königsberg]], had been a part of a German state (the [[Teutonic Order]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Imperial Germany|unified Germany]]) for several centuries before the [[Second World War]], and the city was historically a rich German cultural center, being the home of – among others – the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. 

The annexation of the Königsberg area of [[East Prussia]] to Russia became a stated war aim of the Soviet Union at [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Michael|last2=Coppieters|first2=Bruno|last3=Malashenko|first3=Alekseĭ Vsevolodovich|title=Conflicting Loyalties and the State in Post-Soviet Russia and Eurasia|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714648828|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503193910/https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|archivedate=2018-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the city was captured by the [[Soviet Union]]. As agreed by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]], northern Prussia, including Königsberg, was annexed by the USSR, which attached it to the [[Russian SFSR]]. In 1946, the city's name was changed to [[Kaliningrad]].

In October 1945, only about 5,000 Soviet civilians lived in the territory.&lt;ref name="malinkin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malinkin|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Building a Soviet City: the Transformation of Königsberg|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=2 May 2018|date=8 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707061350/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1947 and October 1948, about 100,000 [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-50)|Germans were forcibly moved]] to Germany.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|title=How to be Russian with a Difference? Kaliningrad and its German Past|journal=Geopolitics|date=13 May 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=345–366|doi=10.1080/14650040903486967}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400,000 Soviet civilians arrived by 1948.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Some moved voluntarily, but as the number of willing settlers proved insufficient, [[collective farms]] were given quotas of how many people they had to send to Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Often they sent the least socially desirable individuals, such as alcoholics and the uneducated.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] suggested that the [[Lithuanian SSR]] should annex Kaliningrad Oblast. The offer was refused by the [[Lithuanian Communist Party]] leader [[Antanas Sniečkus]], who did not wish to alter the ethnic composition of his republic.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=39}} In the late Soviet era, rumors spread that the Oblast might be converted into a homeland for [[Soviet Germans]].&lt;ref name="diener10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Hagen|first2=Joshua|title=Borderlines and Borderlands: Political Oddities at the Edge of the Nation-State|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742568440|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pci-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaliningrad Oblast remained part of the Soviet Union until [[USSR dissolution|its dissolution]] in 1991, and since then has been an [[exclave]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. After the Soviet collapse, some descendants of the expellees and refugees traveled to the city to examine their roots.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; According to the 2010 Russian Census, 7,349 ethnic Germans live in the Oblast, making up 0.8% of the population.&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the status of Kaliningrad and the rights of expellees was a mainstream political issue until the 1960s, when the shifting political discourse increasingly associated similar views with right-wing revisionism.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"/&gt;

According to a ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article published in 2010, in 1990 the West German government received a message from the Soviet general Geli Batenin, offering to return Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="ballast"/&gt; The offer was never seriously considered by the Bonn government, who saw [[German reunification|reunification]] with the East as its priority.&lt;ref name="ballast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiegrefe|first1=Klaus|title=ZEITGESCHICHTE: Historischer Ballast|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014130823/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the EU was alleged to be in talks with Russia to arrange an [[EU association|association]] agreement with the Kaliningrad Oblast, at a time when Russia could not repay £22 billion debt owed to Berlin, which may have given Germany some influence over the territory.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html "Germany in secret talks with Russia to take back Konigsberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206041607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html |date=2018-02-06 }}." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. January 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of "buying back" Kaliningrad or other "secret deals" were repudiated by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|last=Wagner|first=Rudolf|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|date=22 January 2001|accessdate=2018-03-21|title=Königsberg für eine Hand voll Euro?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010948/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rumor about a debt-related deal, published by the Russian weekly ''Nash Continent'', alleged that Putin and [[Edmund Stoiber]] had agreed on the gradual return of Kaliningrad in return for waiving the country's $50 billion debt to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karabeshkin|first1=Leonid|last2=Wellmann|first2=Christian|title=The Russian Domestic Debate on Kaliningrad: Integrity, Identity and Economy|date=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783825879525|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501085510/https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for irredentism==
[[Inesis Feldmanis]], head of the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the [[University of Latvia]], has been quoted saying that the [[Soviet Union]]'s annexation of Kaliningrad is "an error in history".&lt;ref name="moscow"/&gt;

The [[Freistaat Preußen]] Movement, one of the most active offshoots of the [[Reichsbürger]] movement, considers the Russian (and German) government as illegitimate and see themselves as the rightful rulers of the region.&lt;ref name="rhz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reichsbürger: Wie eine „Ministerpräsidentin“ aus der Eifel die Bundesrepublik bekämpft und einen Weltkrieg riskieren will|url=https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Rhein-Zeitung|date=16 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325191444/https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the movement is split into two competing factions, one based in [[Königsfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate]] and the other in Bonn.&lt;ref name="rhz"/&gt;

===In Lithuania===
{{seealso|Lithuania Minor}}
Some political groups in [[Lithuania]] claim the parts of Kaliningrad Oblast between the [[Pregolya River|Pregel]] and [[Nemunas river|Nemunas]] Rivers, but they have little influence.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}} [[Linas Balsys (politician)|Linas Balsys]], a deputy in the Lithuanian parliament, has argued that the status of the exclave should be discussed at international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts comment on Lithuanian MP’s claims regarding Russia's Kaliningrad|url=http://tass.com/politics/927891|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=TASS|date=30 January 2017|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317113724/http://tass.com/politics/927891|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the former Lithuanian president [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] called for the separation and '[[decolonization]]' of Kaliningrad from Russia.&lt;ref name="kempton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempton|first1=Daniel R.|last2=Clark|first2=Terry D.|title=Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275973063|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095203/https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, the Lithuanian parliament speaker [[Romualdas Ozolas]] expressed his view that Kaliningrad should become an independent republic.&lt;ref name="vitunic"/&gt;

Poland has made no claim to Kaliningrad, and is seen as being unlikely to do so, as it was a net beneficiary of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], which also decided the status of Kaliningrad.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6001">'''Lemon socialism''' is a pejorative term for a form of [[Nationalization|government intervention]] in which government [[subsidies]] go to weak or failing firms (''lemons''; see [[Lemon law]]), with the effective result that the government (and thus the taxpayer) absorbs part or all of the recipient's losses. The term derives from the conception that in socialism the government may nationalize a company's profits while leaving the company to pay its own losses, while in lemon socialism the company is allowed to keep its profits but its losses are shifted to the taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul |title=The Geithner put |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/the-geithner-put/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=30 January 2009}} (Defining lemon socialism as "socialized losses, privatized profits.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rithotz |first1=Barry |title=Greeks Stand Up to 'Lemon Socialism' |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2015-07-06/greeks-stand-up-to-lemon-socialism- |accessdate=27 October 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may also be used to describe government efforts to nationalize companies or industries, in which the government takes over failing companies without taking over healthy companies.&lt;ref name=green74&gt;{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Mark J. |title=Deciding On Utilities: Public or Private? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/26/archives/deciding-on-utilities-public-or-private-con-ed-has-taken-a-step.html |accessdate=27 October 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=26 May 1974}} ("Critics fear that a rush to public ownership may bring a form of “lemon socialism"—where the government, as in England, takes over failing companies, but not healthy ones.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Justice and Democracy|first=Robin|last=Hahnel|pages=116|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-93344-7}} ("This problem is also referred to as 'lemon socialism': When social democrats were able to nationalize companies, or industries, it was usually because they were in terrible shape. Consequently they often performed badly as public enterprises simply because they were going to perform badly in any case.")&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of free markets may then point to the faltering, nationalized enterprises as examples of how government regulation hurts business.&lt;ref name=shaw/&gt;

== Origin ==
[[Mark J. Green]] coined the exact phrase in a 1974 article discussing the [[utility company]], [[Con Ed]].&lt;ref name=green74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=Lemon credit|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|date=2 February 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/lemon-credit/|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentiment was earlier expressed in the adage "[[Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor]]", which was in use by the 1960s, though the notion of privatizing profits and socializing losses dates at least to 1834 and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s closing of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].

== Other languages ==
{{expand section|date=December 2009}}
In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], lemon socialism is known as "[[:is:Sósíalismi andskotans|Sósíalismi andskotans]]", meaning "the devil's socialism", a term coined by [[Vilmundur Jónsson]] (1889–1971, Iceland's Surgeon General) in the 1930s to criticize alleged [[crony capitalism]] in [[Landsbanki]], which term has gained renewed currency in the debate over the [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/Oslo%20financial%20crisis%202009.ppt |title=Icelandic banks 2008 in context|author=[http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/inenglish.htm Thorvaldur Gylfason], grandson of Vilmundur Jónsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon socialism, or more precisely crony capitalism, is also referred to as [[:is:Pilsfaldakapítalismi|Pilsfaldakapítalismi]], meaning "skirt capitalism", ''pilsfaldur'' being the hemline of the skirt; and the term referring to children hiding behind their mothers' skirts after having done something wrong to criticize the alleged lack of transparency in dealings and reluctance to deal with bad consequences by themselves.

This is a list of [[scandal]]s or controversies whose names include a "-gate" suffix, by analogy with the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as other incidents to which the suffix has (often facetiously) been applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://public.oed.com/blog/the-gate-suffix/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |chapter=-gate, suffix |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list also includes controversies that are widely referred to with a "-gate" suffix, but may be referred to by another more common name (such as the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]]). Use of the "-gate" suffix has spread beyond U.S. English to many other countries and languages.

== Etymology, usage, and history of ''-gate'' ==

The [[suffix]] ''[[wikt:-gate|-gate]]'' derives from the Watergate scandal of the United States in the early 1970s, which resulted in the resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;"-gate, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2015. Web. June 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal was named after the [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the complex itself was named after the "Water Gate" area where [[symphony orchestra]] concerts were staged on the [[Potomac River]] between 1935 and 1965.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPostAnswerManWaterGate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|title=Answer Man: A Gate to Summers Past|author=John Kelly|work=The Washington Post|date=December 13, 2004|accessdate=September 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jsdEHs1g?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|archivedate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix is used to embellish a noun or name to suggest the existence of a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|far-reaching scandal]], particularly in [[politics]] and [[government]]. As a [[CBC News]] column noted in 2001, the term may "suggest unethical behaviour and a [[cover-up]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I|last=Partridge|first=Eric|page=844|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-25937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such usages have been criticised by commentators as [[cliché]]d and misleading;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06-16/watergate-scandal-changed-political-landscape/55639974/1|title=Watergate scandal changed the political landscape forever|work=USA Today|date=June 16, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Stanyer comments that "revelations are given the 'gate' suffix to add a thin veil of credibility, following 'Watergate', but most bear no resemblance to the painstaking investigation of that particular piece of presidential [[corruption]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanyer|first=James|title=Modern political communication: mediated politics in uncertain times|page=59|publisher=Polity|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-2797-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer links the widespread use of ''-gate'' to what the sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] calls "scandal syndrome":

{{quote|[A] self-reproducing and self-reinforcing process, driven on by competitive and combative struggles in the media and political fields and giving rise to more and more scandals which increasingly become the focus of mediated forms of public debate, marginalizing or displacing other issues and producing on occasion a climate of political crisis which can debilitate or even paralyse a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=John|authorlink=John Thompson (sociologist)|title=Political scandal: power and visibility in the media age|page=265|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7456-2550-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The adoption of ''-gate'' to suggest the existence of a scandal was promoted by [[William Safire]], the conservative ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and former Nixon administration speechwriter. As early as September 1974 he wrote of "Vietgate", a proposed [[Nixon pardon|pardon of the Watergate criminals]] and [[Vietnam War]] [[draft dodger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=Watergate in American memory: how we remember, forget, and reconstruct the past|page=151|publisher=Basic Books|year=1993|isbn=978-0-465-09083-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he coined numerous ''-gate'' terms, including ''Billygate, Briefingate, Contragate, Deavergate, Debategate, Doublebillingsgate'' (of which he later said "My best [-gate coinage] was the encapsulation of a minor ... scandal as doublebillingsgate"), ''Frankiegate, Franklingate, Genschergate, Housegate, Iraqgate, Koreagate, Lancegate, Maggiegate, Nannygate, Raidergate, Scalpgate, Travelgate, Troopergate'' and ''Whitewatergate''. The ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine suggested that his aim in doing so was "rehabilitating Nixon by relentlessly tarring his successors with the same rhetorical brush – diminished [[guilt by association]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smoking Lexicon|last=Cohen|first=Noam|work=New York Magazine|page=13|date=February 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safire himself later said to author [[Eric Alterman]] that he "may have been seeking to minimize the relative importance of the crimes committed by his former boss with this silliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sound and fury: the making of the punditocracy|page=79|last=Alterman|first=Eric|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage has spread into languages other than English; examples of ''-gate'' being used to refer to local political scandals have been reported from [[Argentina]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Hungary]], [[Greece]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph |first=Brian D. |editor-last1=Spencer |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last2=Zwicky |editor-first2=Arnold M.|title=The handbook of morphology|page=361|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|chapter=Diachronic Morphology|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-22694-9}} He cites:

*{{cite journal|last1=Schuhmacher|first1=W. W.|title=More on {{nbh}}Gate|journal=American Speech|date=1989|volume=64|issue=4|page=380|jstor=455733}} (for German)

The use of a suffix in this way is not new. ''-mandering'' has long been used as a suffix by a politician's name in analogy with [[Gerrymandering#Etymology|gerrymandering]] ([[Andrew Johnson#Congressman (1843–1853)|"Henry-mandering" was used in 1852]]). In recent years, the ''-gate'' suffix as a catch-all signifier for scandal has seen some competition from {{nowrap|''-ghazi'',}} as in "Ballghazi" instead of "[[Deflategate]]", or "Bridgeghazi" instead of "[[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]]".  The use of ''-ghazi'' is a play on the [[investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack]], which despite numerous official investigations into the possibility of government cover-ups, has resulted in no criminal charges or major repercussions for the individuals supposedly involved.  ''-ghazi'' may be seen as carrying an ironic or self-effacing connotation in its usage, implying that the event described has the appearance and media coverage of a scandal, but does not actually amount to much in a grander sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeflateGate ... or Ballghazi? Will the new scandal suffix have staying power|last=Farhi|first=Paul|work=The Washington Post|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/deflategate--or-ballghazi-will-the-new-scandal-suffix-have-staying-power/2015/01/27/db1c5eac-a571-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Deflategate]] || 2015 || After the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45, Indianapolis Colts 7|2015 AFC Championship game]], the [[National Football League|NFL]] acknowledged it was investigating reports that the game balls had been deflated. One report may have come from [[Indianapolis Colts]] player [[D'Qwell Jackson]] after he intercepted a pass by [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]]. Patriots coach [[Bill Belichick]] stated he knew nothing of the reports until the morning following the game, and that he and the team would "cooperate fully" with any investigation.  Brady called the allegation "ridiculous". On January 20, sources reported that 11 of 12 footballs provided by the Patriots were underinflated. On May 11, 2015, the NFL announced it had suspended [[Tom Brady]] without pay for 4 games of the [[2015 NFL season|upcoming season]]. The Patriots were fined $1 million and lost their first-round pick in the [[2016 NFL Draft]] and their fourth-round pick in the [[2017 NFL Draft]]. In September 2015 a federal judge overturned the suspension, allowing Brady to play the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]]. A federal appeals court overturned the lower court's ruling, reimposing the suspension for 2016. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/deflategate-nfl-investigating-england-patriots-deflated-balls/story?id=28322679 |title=Deflategate: NFL Probing Whether New England Patriots Used Deflated Balls |date=January 19, 2015|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24981262/report-nfl-finds-11-footballs-were-under-inflated-in-afc-championship-game | title=Report: NFL finds 11 footballs were under-inflated in AFC title game | publisher=[[CBSSports.com]] | date=January 20, 2015 | accessdate=January 21, 2015 | author=Dubin, Jared}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/deflate-gate-england-patriots-coach-team-cooperate-probers/story?id=28330108 |title=Deflate-Gate: New England Patriots Coach Says Team Will Cooperate With Probers |date=January 19, 2015|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nesn.com/2015/01/reports-dqwell-jacksons-interception-sparked-deflated-ball-controversy/ |title=Reports: D’Qwell Jackson's Interception Sparked Deflated Ball Controversy |date=January 20, 2015|publisher=NESN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000492185/article/brady-suspended-4-games-patriots-forfeit-2016-first-rounder|title=Brady suspended 4 games; Patriots forfeit 2016 first rounder|work=NFL.com|first=Gregg|last= Rosenthal |date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Driv3rgate]]
|2004
|Before the worldwide release of ''[[Driver 3]]'', Atari offered the magazines ''[[PSM3|PSM2]]'' and ''[[Xbox World]]'' early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores. This deal was taken by both of them, yet, due to the disappointing nature of the game when it was released, gamers took to forums to complain about the mysterious circumstances related to why both magazines gave positive scores for a heavily berated game. Many then figured out that Atari had paid both, and as a response the comments were systematically wiped by administrators, which gave way to suggestions of a cover up by the publishing house. This controversy would later be referred to as "DRIV3Rgate" and the affair gained a fairly large amount of coverage in the games press and on Internet forums. During this time, Atari hired a guerrilla team to, in desperation, repeatedly make new accounts and post positive threads and comments about the game in an attempt to reduce the controversy.

Gerstmann had awarded a ''Fair'' rating to the game ''[[Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men]]'' at a time when the game was being heavily advertised on GameSpot, which led to accusations from many games journalists of a lack of editorial integrity on the part of GameSpot, who denied that the review had been a part of the reasoning behind the dismissal. However, a subsequent interview with Gerstmann in 2012 countered this statement, with Gerstmann claiming that, although there was more to his firing than any single review, it would not be untrue to say that the Kane &amp; Lynch episode contributed to it.

|[[2013 horse meat scandal|Horsegate]] (also "Horsemeat-gate")
|2013
|A UK scandal in which it emerged that several large supermarket chains were selling meat containing horse or equine meat while claiming they were "100% beef." Further context to this is that, while horsemeat is mostly fine for human consumption and is eaten in countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world, it is rarely sold on the mainstream UK market and is considered somewhat culturally unacceptable to eat in British society.

{{political corruption sidebar}}
The term '''mafia state''' is a political [[buzzword]] to describe a [[Sovereign state|state]] system where the [[government]] is tied with [[organized crime]], including when government officials, [[police]], and/or [[military]] take part in [[Black market|illicit enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137529/moises-naim/mafia-states Mafia States: Organized Crime Takes Office] by Moisés Naím.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''mafia'' is a reference to any organized crime groups strongly connected with the authorities.

According to the critics of the mafia state concept, the term "has now been so used and abused in popularized descriptions of organized criminal activity that it has lost much of its analytic value".&lt;ref name=peter-andreas/&gt;

According to US diplomats, [[Alexander Litvinenko]] coined the phrase Mafia state.&lt;ref name="luhn-harding-guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/spain-issues-arrest-warrants-for-russian-officials-close-to-putin | date = 5 November 2015 | access-date = 27 April 2016 | first1 = Alec | last1 = Luhn | first2 = Luke | last2 = Harding | authorlink2 = Luke Harding | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = Spain issues arrest warrants for Russian officials close to Putin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Particular applications of the concept==

===[[Cosa Nostra]] in Italy and [[Yakuza]] in Japan===
[[File:Giulio Andreotti.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Giulio Andreotti]], seven-time [[Prime Minister of Italy]], was charged with having links to the Mafia]]
In a critical review of Moisés Naím's essay in ''[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]'', Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese [[Yakuza]], writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments.&lt;ref name=peter-andreas&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreas |first=Peter |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137692/peter-andreas-moises-naim/measuring-the-mafia-state-menace |title=Measuring the Mafia-State Menace: Are Government-Backed Gangs a Grave New Threat? |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat.&lt;ref name=peter-andreas/&gt;

In Italy, the actions of the mafia can continue to affect people's lives today. The Italian "Camorra" Mafia network became powerful in the city of [[Naples]] in the 19th Century; although it can trace its origins back to 15th Century Spain and today extending its influence to European countries above Italy as well. The Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta both as well existed in Italy with a confederation of about 150 different groups each with their own organizations and ruling body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Letizia|first1=Paoli|title=Oxford Handbook of Italian Politics|date=May 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199669745|pages=670–671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the network, known as the "[[Casalesi clan]]" became involved in business in the 1970s and 80s, eventually gaining control of large areas of the local economy "partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges". Among the contracts the clan gained was for the disposal of toxic waste, however, much of it was dumped illegally. This dumped toxic waste is thought to be cause of a rise in the number suffering from cancer in towns around Naples. The rise was first noticed two decades ago, and has been calculated that there has been a 40 and 47 per cent increase in cancer in women and men respectively. The Italian Senate is currently investigating the causes of the cancers, with illegal dumping thought to be the likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24678624 | work=BBC News | title=The toxic reason a mafia boss became a police informant | date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries described as Mafia states===

====Republics and territories of the former Yugoslavia====
[[File:Secretary Kerry Puts the Cap Back on His Pen After Signing an Accession Protocol to Continue Montenegro's Admission to NATO in Brussels (27045333901) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Montenegro's president [[Milo Đukanović]] is often described as having strong links to [[Montenegrin mafia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.occrp.org/personoftheyear/2015/ OCCRP announces 2015 Organized Crime and Corruption ‘Person of the Year’ Award]". [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Kosovo]], a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a "mafia state" by Italian MEP [[Pino Arlacchi]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=b92.net&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=72906 |title=Kosovo is "mafia state", says Italian MEP |publisher=B92.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by [[Moisés Naím]] in his 2012 essay "Mafia States" in the ''[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]''. Naím pointed out that [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]] [[Hashim Thaçi]] is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made, and investigated by several countries, against Thaçi.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Naím also labeled [[Montenegro]] as a "mafia state" in the same essay,&lt;ref name=foreignaffairs.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreas |first=Peter |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137692/peter-andreas-moises-naim/measuring-the-mafia-state-menace |title=Measuring the Mafia-State Menace |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as a hub for [[cigarette smuggling]].&lt;ref name=peter-andreas/&gt;

====Transnistria====
[[Transnistria]], an [[diplomatic recognition|unrecognised]] break-away state from [[Moldova]], has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a [[quasistate]] whose economy is dependent on [[contraband]]&lt;ref name="An illegal business "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bne.eu/archive_story.php?id=3467&amp;words[]=contraband&amp;words[]=moldova | title=An illegal business that's smoking | publisher=[[Business New Europe]] | date=2012-04-18 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gunrunning]].&lt;ref name="Ющенко"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://korrespondent.net/business/149005-yushchenko-ukraina-nedopoluchaet-iz-za-kontrabandy-iz-pridnestrovya | title=Ющенко: Украина недополучает из-за контрабанды из Приднестровья | publisher=[[Korrespondent]] | date=23 March 2006 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hotbed "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jan/18/20040118-103519-5374r/ | title=Hotbed of weapons deals | publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Приднестровье самоизолировалось"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/656240 |title=Приднестровье самоизолировалось |work=Kommersant-Ukraine |date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |author1=СВИРИДЕНКО, АЛЕКСАНДР |author2=НЕПРЯХИНА, НАТАЛИЯ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191045/http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/656240 |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, [[Vladimir Voronin]], called Transnistria a "residence of international mafia", "smuggling stronghold" and "outpost of [[Islamism|Islamic combatants]]". The allegations were followed by attempts of customs blockade. Reacting to the allegations, [[Russia]]n state-run [[Russia-1 (TV channel)|RTR]] aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of [[small arms]] purposely for subsequent [[arms trafficking|illegal trafficking]] via the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] port of [[Odessa]]. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler [[Igor Smirnov]].&lt;ref name="ДНЕСТРОВСКИЕ ПОРОГИ"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://gazeta.zn.ua/POLITICS/dnestrovskie_porogi.html | script-title=ru:ДНЕСТРОВСКИЕ ПОРОГИ | work=[[Zerkalo Nedeli]] | date=February 8, 2002 | accessdate=2 January 2014 | author=Bulavchenko, Aliona | language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in [[arms trafficking]] concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} During the press-conference on 30 November 2006 head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyWih4cCCc8 Fragment of EUBAM press-conference regarding Mission activities in 2004-2006] Transnistrian Customs Committee Press-Service.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Ukrainian Foreign Minister and acting chairman of the OSCE Leonid Kozhara gave an interview to ''El País'' newspaper, commenting on situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/06/04/actualidad/1370334170_344660.html Queremos zonas de libre comercio tanto al Este como hacia el Oeste] El Pais. 4 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts from Russia and Transnistria state that allegations of Transnistria being a "mafia state", "black hole of Europe", "heaven for arms trafficking", etc. are a carefully planned defamation campaign paid by the Moldovan government and aimed at producing negative image of Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://customs-science.net/?p=85 Some aspects of administrative legal regime of customs activities of Transnistria in context of work of international monitoring missions] Customs and Science. 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials from the [[European Union]] and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]), say they have no evidence that the Tiraspol regime has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material. Much of the alarm is attributed to efforts by the Moldovan government to increase pressure on Transdniester.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/1062030.html Moldova: Western Diplomats Say Reports Of Smuggling From Transdniester Likely Exaggerated] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. October 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
The term has been used by [[defector]] [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and some Western media to describe the [[political system]] in [[Russia]] under [[Vladimir Putin]]'s rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17200833 Putin's Russia 'now a mafia state'], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11893886 Wikileaks: Russia branded 'mafia state' in cables], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/24/115524 British MPs paint scary picture of Putin's Russia], [[EUObserver]]&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization came to prominence following the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], which revealed that US diplomats viewed Russia as "a [[corruption|corrupt]], [[Autocracy|autocratic]] [[kleptocracy]] centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]] and [[organised crime]] are bound together to create a 'virtual [[Russian mafia|mafia]] state.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-russia-mafia-kleptocracy WikiLeaks cables condemn Russia as 'mafia state'], [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334865/WikiLeaks-Putin-probably-knew-Alexander-Litvinenko-poisoning.html 'Mafia state' leader Putin knew of poison plot that killed former KGB spy in London], [[Daily Mail]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his book titled ''[[Mafia State (book)|Mafia State]]'', journalist and author [[Luke Harding]] argues that Putin has "created a state peopled by ex-[[KGB]] and [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] officers, like himself, [who are] bent on making money above all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3329930.htm Expelled Moscow correspondent claims Russia is mafia state], abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; In the estimation of American diplomats, "the government [of Russia] effectively [is] the mafia."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/europe/02wikileaks-russia.html?pagewanted=2 Below Surface, U.S. Has Dim View of Putin and Russia], [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-751968 Russia - Mafia State: It's important to tell the truth about Putin's Russia], [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Holmes, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n01/stephen-holmes/fragments-of-a-defunct-state Fragments of a Defunct State], [[London Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', "the term had entered the lexicon of expert discussion" several years before the cables leak, "and not as a frivolous metaphor. Those most familiar with the country had come to see it as a kleptocracy with Vladimir Putin in the role of ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'', dividing the spoils and preventing [[wikt:turf war|turf war]]s between rival clans of an essentially criminal elite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/10/russia-mafia-harding-putin Review: Mafia State], [[New Statesman]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Stephen Blank noted that Russia under Putin is "a state that European officials privately call a Mafia state" that "naturally gravitates toward Mafia-like behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Blank (2008): What Comes After the Russo–Georgian War? What's at Stake in the CIS, ''[[National Committee on American Foreign Policy|American Foreign Policy Interests]]'', 30:6, 379–391&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolay Petrov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said "it's pretty hard to damage the Russian image in the world because it's already not very good".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121223084127/http://www.euronews.com/2010/12/02/putin-russia-s-mafia-state-image-no-disaster Russia’s "mafia state" image no disaster], euronews&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The scholar of [[Law and Economics]] [[Edgardo Buscaglia]] describes the political system of [[Mexico]] as a "Mafiacracy". Buscaglia characterises the condition between the state, the economy and organized crime in Mexico as a mutual interweaving, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2011-03/drogenstaat-mexiko-korruption Die Zeit-Online: Interview with Edgardo Buscaglia (German-speaking Article)]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico has also been labeled as a [[Narco-state]] (a country where the political power and the economy it's closely related and its relies highly on protecting the drug trafficking mafias).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/1380561.ven-en-eu-a-mexico-como-narcoestado.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malta ====
Jonathan Benton, the former head of a [[United Kingdom]] anti-corruption agency, described [[Malta]] as a “mafia state” where money laundering transactions of hundreds of millions of euros are made every year without any problem. He made this statement while speaking on [[BBC Radio|BBC radio]] following the murder of investigative journalist [[Daphne Caruana Galizia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171021/local/ex-british-anti-corruption-boss-dubs-malta-mafia-state.660939|title=Ex-British anti-corruption boss dubs Malta ‘mafia state’|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-level (or multilevel) governance''' is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Political scientists [[Liesbet Hooghe]] and [[Gary Marks]] developed the concept of multi-level governance in the early 1990s and have continuously been contributing to the research program in a series of articles (see Bibliography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piattoni|first=Simona|title=Multi-level Governance: a Historical and Conceptual Analysis|journal=European Integration|year=2009|volume=2|series=31|pages=163–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their theory resulted from the study of the new structures that were put in place by the EU ([[Maastricht Treaty]]) in 1992. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It "illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority".

==Origins and significance of the concept of multi-level governance==
'Multi-level governance' is a recent concept, having first entered the lexicon of political science around fifteen years ago as comparativists became re-acquainted with European integration and discovered that authority was shifting not only from central states up to Europe, but also down to subnational authorities. The first efforts to understand this were descriptive, spawning concepts that have generated an extensive literature. Multi-level, polycentric, and multi-layered governance emphasize the dispersion of decision making from the local to the global level. In recent years these concepts have cross-pollinated subfields of political science including [[European studies]] and [[decentralization]], [[federalism]] and [[international organization]], [[public policy]] (e.g. [[environmental policy]], [[health policy]]) and public-private governance, [[local governance]] and [[transnational governance]].

The authors of a recent survey of the literature on the structure of government conclude that ‘We attribute many of the recent “cutting-edge” theoretical contributions in political science to studies of “multi-level governance”’ and they note that although students of federalism ‘considered the current subject matter of their field to be based on well-defined, well rooted and broadly accepted ideas, they were nevertheless open to a new flowering of federal theory as a result of fertilization by these new MLG theoretical developments’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Michael|author2=Lisa Turkewitsch|title=The Concept of Multilevel Governance in Studies of Federalism|journal=paper presented at the International Political Science Association|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing entirely new under the sun. Though scarcely recognized at the time, this research revives a rich tradition in political science represented by [[Karl Deutsch]] (1966) on the effect of societal transactions on government structure, [[Robert Dahl]] (1973) on the virtues and vices of multilevel democracy, and [[Stein Rokkan]] (1983) on identity and territorial politics.

==Application of the concept==
===Multi-level governance and the European Union===
The study of the [[European Union]] has been characterized by two different theoretical phases. The first phase was dominated by studies from the field of [[international relations]]; in the second phase these studies were revised and insights from among others, [[public policy]] were added. The most straightforward way of understanding this theoretical shift is to see it as a move away from treating the EU as an [[international organisation]] similar to others (e.g. [[NATO]]) to seeing it as something unique among international organisations. The uniqueness of the EU relates both to the nature and to the extent of its development. This means that in some areas of activity the EU displays more properties related to national political systems than to those of international organisations.

The theory of multi-level governance belongs to the second phase. Multi-level governance characterizes the changing relationships between actors situated at different territorial levels, both from the public and the private sectors. The multi-level governance theory crosses the traditionally separate domains of domestic and international politics and highlights the increasingly fading distinction between these domains in the context of [[European integration]]. 
Multi-level governance was first developed from a study of EU policy and then applied to EU [[decision-making]] more generally. An early explanation referred to multi-level governance as ''a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers''&lt;ref&gt;G. Marks, 'Structural policy and Multi-level governance in the EC' in: A. Cafruny and G. Rosenthal (ed.) ''The State of the European Community: The Maastricht Debate and Beyond'' (Boulder 1993) pp.391–411&lt;/ref&gt; and described how ''supranational, national, regional, and local governments are enmeshed in territorially overarching policy networks''.&lt;ref&gt;I.Bache, ''Europeanization and Britain: Towards Multi-level governance?'' Paper prepared for the EUSA 9th Biennal Conference in Austin, Texas, 31–2 March April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emphasized both the increasingly frequent and complex interactions between governmental actors and the increasingly important dimension of non-state actors that are mobilized in cohesion policy-making and in the EU policy more generally. As such, multi-level governance raised new and important questions about the role, power and authority of states.

No other international form of cooperation is characterized by such far-reaching integration as the [[European Union]]. This becomes evident by the number and scope of policy areas covered by the European Union and the way policy is developed. The European Union can be characterised by a mix of classic intergovernmental cooperation between sovereign states and far-reaching supranational integration.

Multi-level governance within the EU is understood as respecting competences, sharing responsibilities and cooperating between the various levels of governance: the EU, the Member States and the regional and local authorities. In this context, it refers to the principle of [[subsidiarity]], which places decisions as close as possible to the citizens and ensures that that action at Union level is justified in light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Multilevel governance: building Europe in partnership|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice Multilevel Governance within the EU is about participation and coordination between all levels of government both in the decision making process and in the implementation or evaluation of European policies.

The combination of communal decision-making with the wide area of policy areas results in a deep entanglement of the member states’ national policy levels with the European policy level. This entanglement is one of the basic principles of the multi-level governance theory. The multi-level governance theory describes the European Union as a [[political system]] with interconnected institutions that exist at multiple levels and that have unique policy features. The European Union is a political system with a European layer ([[European Commission]], [[European Council]] and [[European Parliament]]), a national layer and a regional layer. These layers interact with each other in two ways: first, across different levels of government (vertical dimension) and second, with other relevant actors within the same level (horizontal dimension).

Concerning with the changes of the institutional design of the European Union, the current model governance has been shaped as a setup of constraints upon political margin of discretion, applying the central tenet of ordoliberalism with the aim to use strong rules in order to reduce the discretionary exercise of powers by institutions so as to avoid an arbitrary use of them. This principle has achieved an extreme effect at the European level, that one not to avoid arbitrary use of political powers but to keep political responsibility and participation out of the decision-making process. As Laruffa concludes: 
"It is quite clear that such a model of governance, which is made only by rules without any role for a democratic policy-making process, imposes a de facto limit to on the political rights of the European citizens. This means that there is a control exercised by rules over the European citizens rather than a control by the European citizens over rules and policies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressiveeconomy.eu/sites/default/files/papers/Matteo%20Laruffa%20The%20European%20economic%20governance.pdf Laruffa Matteo, The European Economic Governance: Problems and Proposals for Institutional Innovations, Winning Paper for the Annual Meeting Progressive Economy, Brussels, 6 March 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Union: Multilevel Governance in Practise'''

Within the European Union nearly 95,000 local and regional authorities currently have significant powers in key sectors such as education, the environment, economic development, town and country planning, transport, public services and social policies. These local and regional authorities implement nearly 70% of EU legislation. They help ensure the exercise of European democracy and citizenship. Special rights and competences for regions, cities and communities are supposed to enable and preserve diversity of governance at local and regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande and Delebarre|title=Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multilevel Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; By thinking beyond traditional EU - Member States relations the EU multi-level governance concept further strengthens regional and transnational cooperation. In a broader sense, this concept also includes the participation of non-state players like economic and social partners and civil society in the decision making process of all levels of governance(thus taking up the vertical and horizontal dimensions of multilevel governance).

'''The Treaty of Lisbon as an important step towards Multilevel Governance'''

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] represents an important step towards institutional recognition of multi-level governance in the way the European Union operates. It strengthens the competences and influence of local and regional authorities in the Community decision-making process giving roles to national (and regional) parliaments and the [[Committee of the Regions]] and enshrines the territorial dimension of the European Union, notably territorial cohesion as part of the process of European integration. The Committee of the Regions has established a system to monitor the compliance with the subsidiarity thorough the whole EU policy and law making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of the Regions: Subsidiarity Monitoring Network|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/networks/Pages/subsidiarity-monitoring-network.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multilevel governance within the EU as an ongoing process'''

Nevertheless, multi-level governance within the EU is a dynamic and ongoing process. On 16 June 2009 the Committee of the Regions adopted a White Paper on multi-level governance which recommended specific mechanisms and instruments for stimulating all stages of the European decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|last2=Delebarre|first2=Michel|title=The Committee of the Regions' White Paper on Multi-level Governance|url=http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/Ourviews/Documents/White%20Paper%20on%20MLG.pdf|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document, together with the follow-up opinion "Building a European culture of Multilevel Governance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van den Brande|first1=Luc|title=Building a European Culture of Multilevel Governance: Follow-up to the Committee of the Regions' White Paper|url=http://www.toad.cor.europa.eu/ViewDoc.aspx?doc=cdr%5ccivex-v%5cdossiers%5ccivex-v-020%5cEN%5cCDR273-2011_FIN_AC_EN.doc&amp;docid=2829023|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed the Committee’s political commitment to Multi-level Governance, proposing a first political project for Building Europe in partnership. As a follow up to the 2009 White paper on Multi-level Governance, the Committee developed a "Scoreboard on Multi-level Governance" to monitor on a yearly basis the development of multi-level governance at European Union level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=The Multilevel Governance Scoreboard|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/mlg-scoreboard.aspx|website=www.cor.europa.eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe'''

On 3 April 2014 the Committee of the Regions adopted a Charter for Multi-level Governance calling public authorities of all levels of governance to use and promote multi-level governance in their future undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee of the Regions|title=Charter for Multilevel Governance in Europe|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/governance/Pages/charter-for-multiLevel-governance.aspx|website=www.cor.europa,eu|publisher=Committee of the Regions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter is open for signature to:

• all European Union local and regional authorities;

• European and national associations of local and regional authorities, as well as local and regional authorities' network are invited to officially commit to multilevel governance principles, giving the Charter their formal support;

• National and European political figures wishing to back up the Charter are also invited to declare their support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=New|first1=Europe|title=CoR: Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/cor-charter-multilevel-governance-europe|accessdate=3 April 2014|agency=New Europe|date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level governance beyond the European Union===
The point of departure for multi-level governance was Europe, but recent books and articles have dealt with the dispersion of authority away from central states in Latin America, Asia, and North America. Decentralization has been at least as marked in Latin America as in Europe over the past two decades, and several Asian countries have decentralized in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand &amp; Laliberte 2010; Bird &amp; Vaillancourt 2008; Eaton 2008; Falleti 2010; Smoke et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion of authority above the national state is most evident in the EU, but it is not sui generis. A recent survey counts 32 regional IGOs pooling authority over quite wide areas of policy and which cover all but a handful of states in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Goertz &amp; Powers 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The number of governmental and non-governmental [[international organizations]] has increased markedly over the past two decades, as has their scope, range and intrusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya &amp; Johnston 2007; Farrell et al. 2005; Hurrell 1993; Volgy et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Crossborder interdependence – from migration to climate change to terrorism – has stimulated regional organization in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brondizio, Ostrom, Young 2009; Hurrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal dimension of multi-level governance==
The "vertical" dimension refers to the linkages between higher and lower levels of government, including their institutional, financial, and informational aspects. Here, local capacity building and incentives for effectiveness of sub national levels of government are crucial issues for improving the quality and coherence of public policy.

The "horizontal" dimension refers to co-operation arrangements between regions or between municipalities. These agreements are increasingly common as a means by which to improve the effectiveness of local public service delivery and implementation of development strategies.

==Consequences and practical relevance of multi-level governance==
There has been an intensification of research on the consequences as well as the character of multi-level governance. The concept was developed as a tool of pure research, but it now motivates policy makers. From the late 1990s the European Commission began to refer to its own mission as one of achieving multilevel governance, especially in cohesion policy.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardi (2005: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Commission set up a committee on multilevel governance to contribute to its White Paper on governance. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, claims that ‘the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge’ and that, in the current economic crisis, 'multilevel governance must be a priority'.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2008 resolution, the European Parliament called on the member states ‘to develop as quickly as possible the practical measures set out in the First Action Programme . . . with a view to strengthening multilevel governance’.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament resolution of 21 October 2008 on governance and partnership at national and regional levels and a basis for projects in the sphere of regional policy (2008/2064(INI)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 344 representatives of elected regional and local authorities across the EU approved a resolution on a 'European Union Charter for Multilevel Governance', which would bring localities and regions into European democratic decision making.&lt;ref&gt;‘Own-Initiative Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The Committee of the Regions’ White Paper on Multilevel Governance’, 80th plenary session, 17–18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has been taken up by several political parties including the European Peoples Party, representing Christian democratic parties in the European Parliament, which recently stated that ‘multilevel governance should be one of the guiding principles of the EU, an integral part of any European strategy or policy where local and regional authorities are widely implicated, and monitored closely to ensure that it is indeed being put into practice on the ground’.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cor.europa.eu/epp/News/Pages/18October2011.aspx (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

International organizations have also taken positions on the issue. In 2009, the United Nations Development Programme released a report, ‘Delivering Human Security through Multilevel Governance’, which argued that ‘the two-level approach to international relations . . . is being replaced by a much more complex multilevel system of governance that also involves local, sub-national providers of public goods as well as regional governance actors acting at a supranational but not a global level’. The World Bank has commissioned a series of studies examining multilevel governance; the United Nations has a research and training institute on comparative regional integration that studies ‘multilevel regulatory processes and the relations between sub- and supra-national regional governance’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103529/http://www.cris.unu.edu/Comparative-Regional-Integration.15.0.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }} (accessed on 13 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD has created a directorate on multilevel governance.

However, the consequences of multilevel governance are debated. In the eyes of its detractors, multilevel governance exacerbates corruption (Treisman 2000), leads to gridlock (Scharpf 2007), engenders moral hazard (Rodden 2006), constrains redistribution (Obinger, Castles, Leibfried 2005), obfuscates accountability (Peters &amp; Pierre 2004), and wastes money (Berry 2009). Research on both causes and consequences of multi-level governance is ongoing and more and more information about the subnational as well as the international dimension of multi-level governance is available in the context of larger data sets.&lt;ref&gt;For a current large-scale research project on multi-level governance see http://www.falw.vu/~mlg/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Amongst others, the project codes regional authority in 74 countries between 1950 and 2010 as well as international authority in 72 [[international governmental organizations]] from 1950 to 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=2011|volume=20|issue=6|ssrn=1970698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-level governance of climate change in cities ===
Global climate change is being contributed to by ever increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from decisions and activities of individuals and organisations at local, regional, national and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|author2=Kristine Kern|title=Local Government and the Governing of Climate Change in Germany and the UK|journal=Urban Studies|year=2006|volume=43|series=12|pages=2237–2259|doi=10.1080/00420980600936491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are suggested to contribute up to 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, reflecting the increasing proportions of global populations living and working in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2010|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we know, tackling climate change is an extensive, time-consuming and costly task, a task that cannot be achieved solely through the policy implementation and regulation from central governments and bodies alone. It has become increasingly clear that nation-states will be unable to commit to and meet international targets and agreements for offsetting climate change without engaging with the activity of sub-national and local action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereby, warranting the extreme importance of multi-level governance of climate change within cities.

Forms of governance at multi-levels have taken off increasingly at the local scale, building upon the notion of ‘think global, act local’, in cities in particular. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stem from certain activities that originate from specific places, bringing about thought that the local scale is the most appropriate political scale to produce necessary offsets in emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities are exemplary of such specific places in which local governance action can and will help reduce GHG emissions. The levels of governance authority handed down to local governments within cities has been perceived to out-do policy goals within the national and international arena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some local governments taking on their own initiatives for tackling urban climate change. This sets an important stance to which the local scale of multi-level governance is important for tackling global climate change within the urban arena.

Four distinct modes of governance exist within the dynamics of climate change in cities. Each stems from the local level with the ability of being implemented on multi-scales to mitigate and adapt to urban climate change. Self-governing is the capacity of local governments to govern its own activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as improving energy efficiency within a designated city, without the burdening pressure to meet targets of increased energy efficiencies set by national governments. A form of self-governing within multi-level systems is horizontal collaboration where cities may collaborate with regions demonstrating multi-levels of governance to tackle urban climate change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; imperative to the success of city climate change policy. Governing through enabling is the co-ordination and facilitation of partnerships with private organisations by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kern|first = Kristine|title = Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal = Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change.|year = 2008|url = |last2 = Gotelind Alber}}&lt;/ref&gt; National governments also implement this mode of governance to implement policy and action within cities. Governing through provision, a form of vertical collaboration along with governing through enabling, applies itself to the multi-levels of governance. Climate change in cities is tackled here through the shaping of and delivery of services and resources, with additional support aided to local governments from regional and national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, another form of vertical collaboration, is governing through regulation. Such regulation characterises traditional forms of authoritative governance, exemplifying local to nation-state relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Kristine|author2=Gotelind Alber|title=Governing Climate Change in Cities: Modes of urban Climate Governance in Multi-level Systems|journal=Conference on Competitive Cities and Climate Change|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost nearly covering the entirety of the multi-level governance scale.

=== Subnational Integration of Climate Actions ===
Within the various initiatives of the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership ([[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)|LEDS GP]]), the thematic working group on Subnational Integration ([http://ledsgp.org/working-groups/subnational-integration-of-leds/ SNI-WG]) was created in 2013 to support learning and facilitate collaboration between national and subnational governments for accelerated effective climate actions. The SNI-WG realizes several activities at global and regional levels including organizing panels at multiple regional and global forums, hosting peer-learning discussions, publishing reports and case studies, along with facilitating technical workshops, webinars and providing advisory Remote Expert Assistance on LEDS ([http://ledsgp.org/assistance REAL]) support upon request. This process has generated observations, feedback and insights on the potential of the vertical integration and coordination of subnational climate actions to accelerate and scale-up both local and global emission reductions. Improving coordination and integration between the different levels of authority in a country is critical in determining both national and global capacity to govern climate change. City and subnational governments require support from the national government, and vice versa, in order to design and implement intersectoral policies and actions for domestic decarbonization pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/multilevel-governance-low-emission-development-lac/?loclang=en_gb|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America: Multilevel dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilevel governance theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that the coordination and vertical integration of climate actions can:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Coordination-and-vertical-integration-of-climate-actions-web-final.pdf|title = The Coordination and Vertical Integration of Climate Actions|last = Muller|first = Scott A|date = 2015|journal = LEDS GP Working Paper|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help alleviate domestic political constraints.
* Raise national government ambitions for more aggressive Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ([http://unfccc.int/focus/indc_portal/items/8766.php INDCs]) and [[Greenhouse gas|GHG mitigation]] commitments.
* Scale up, as well as unlock, additional and new mitigation opportunities at the subnational level.
* Accelerate the effective implementation of national targets, strategies and development priorities by “localizing” them. This can also provide opportunities for “bundled approaches” and increasing “co-benefits” by linking local priorities with diverse development objectives Improve the consistency of sub-national and national climate data sets; strengthening MRV.
* Create a more bankable “low-risk” environment for infrastructure finance and private sector investments.
* Enable safe learning and strengthen domestic institutions.
* Address recognized challenges and limits to sub-national [[Non-state actor|non-state actor (NSA)]] climate actions.
* Expand and accelerate the flow of international public and private climate finance to cities, urban infrastructure and local priorities.
* Help address some of the persistent collective action challenges to multilateral climate agreements.

==== Cities for Climate Protection program ====

The [[Cities for Climate Protection program|Cities for Climate Protection]] (CCP) program is one example of multi-level governance of climate change. Roles and responsibilities are shared within different levels of governance, from state actors to non-state actors (Betsill &amp; Bulkeley, 2006). Membership consists of 40 large cities worldwide ([[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]]), with local governments often working in close connection with national governments. However, the CCP can overlook the activity of nation-states giving local governments the opportunity to amend positions of policy implementation and regulation for offsetting urban climate change, which may be of a controversial nature to national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=Michele|author2=Harriet Bulkeley|title=Cities and the Multi-level Governance of Global Climate Change|journal=Global Governance|year=2006|volume=12|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus illustrating even though climate change in cities can be addressed and governed at local, regional, national and international levels, it does not always follow a hierarchical order.

==Criticism on multi-level governance theory==
Many of the problems associated with multi-level governance revolve around the notion of levels. The very idea of levels and levels of analysis is imbued with hierarchical implications. However, different levels or social spaces often interact or cut across with one another in complex ways that are not strictly hierarchical. To what extent can 'levels' be identified at all? The notion that international bodies constitute a discrete level of authority and governance is contestable. International regulatory networks may not be separate sources of authority but instead represent the reconstitution of state authority and the pursuit of state-level governance by other means. While territorial levels make sense when we are referring to public forms of authority, they seem less compatible with private and market forms of authority.

Another criticism on the theory of multi-level governance is that it's not really a proper theory, rather that it is an approach. The main difference between multi-level governance and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between [[intergovernmentalism]] and [[supranationalism]] and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the [[sovereignty]] of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.

The identification of partial political measures and general macroeconomics is divided on diverse decisional levels. National governments maintain an important decisional role but the control unlocalizes at supranational level. Individual national sovereignty is dilated in this decisional process and the supranational institutions have an autonomic role.

== Arguments for multi-level governance ==
=== Security ===
The use of security as a means of instituting ideals of democracy. The shift to a multi-level governance perspective of enforcing the ideals prevents one nation from imposing its personal agenda or perception of what these ideals entail. Additionally, the use of supranational judgement creates a uniformity for the international portrayal and enforcement of democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of multi-level security governance allows for a pooling of resources to manage this enforcement, while still allowing States to act autonomously. The supranational level merely acts as a medium for allowing the promotion of mutually beneficial security. With the rise of transnational threats, a method for ensuring international security without the reliance on a single policing nation is required. Multi-level governance provides functional means of dealing with the deficiencies of merely national actors dealing with transnational issues on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Howorth|first2=Jolyon|last3=Krahmann|first3=Elke|last4=Terriff|first4=Terry|last5=Webber|first5=Mark|title=The Governance of European Security|journal=Review of International Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–26|jstor=20097896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Interdependence ===
The preliminary notion of the European Union was the European Coal and Steel Community. The union was between the nations of France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. Striving for the concept of European peace the nations sought to bind the nations through economic interdependence. Coming about as a reaction to World War II, the ECSC created an economic tie for previously independent nations. It provided the European peace the nations sought, and would evolve into the European Union seen today. It was not a new concept as trade has historically been viewed as a catalyst for peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating multi-level governance is shown to create the necessary ties for fostering economic interdependence to a greater degree than mere trade between nations. The linking of nations through a sharing of capital creates an adhesiveness that deters the escalation of political conflict from reaching a state of war. On the international stage, political conflict leads to war as a result of perception of potential gains being larger than the opportunity costs. Interdependence created by multi-level governance is shown to greatly reduce the probability of war by increasing the opportunity costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartzke|first1=Erik|last2=Quan|first2=Li|last3=Boehmer|first3=Charles|title=Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict|journal=International Organization|date=2001|volume=55|issue=2|pages=391–438|jstor=3078636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in opportunity cost to war can be viewed from even the economic ties perspective. It is seen by noting that economic ties between participatory nations makes the cost of disruption to the system through the escalation of the political sphere towards war illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Jean-Marc|last2=Ripsman|first2=Norrin|title=Qualitative Research on Economic Interdependence and Conflict: Overcoming Methodological Hurdles|journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate|date=2003|pages=310–323|jstor=10.3998/mpub.11952.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
Multi-level government has shown to increase efficiency of governance by creating an agreed upon standard for the implementation and execution of policies. To elaborate, the establishment of a supranational institution can be used to set standards for the way cooperating nations run their environmental, industrial, and safety policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor for multi-level governance is the terms the national actors agree to when forming the supranational institution as they will give certain decision making processes to the higher level, and agree to abide by the outcome. Nations consent to the terms as they face a common issue of international policy that has to deal with collective-action problems making it nonsensical to attend to by themselves. Agreements between nations to form a multi-level government creates an efficiency gain that allows them to all share in the positive benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gruber|first1=Lloyd|title=The Efficiency Rationale for Supranational Governance|journal=Ruling the World: Power Politics and the Rise of Supranational Institutions|date=2000|pages=61–80|jstor=j.ctt7s8w1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded use of the term "bleeding-heart libertarian" seems to have been in a 1996 essay by [[Roderick T. Long]].&lt;ref name=long&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freenation.org/a/f41l2.html|title=Beyond the Boss|last=Long|first= Roderick|year=1996|accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently used in a [[blog]] post by Stefan Sharkansky,&lt;ref name=sharkansky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usefulwork.com/shark/archives/000001.html|title=My Blog and Welcome to It|last=Sharkansky|first=Stefan|date=2002-06-01|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later picked up and elaborated on by [[Arnold Kling]] in an article for ''[[TCS Daily]]''.&lt;ref name=kling-intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2003/09/bleeding-heart-libertarianism.html|title=Bleeding-Heart Libertarianism|last=Kling|first=Arnold|date=2003-09-29|accessdate=2012-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519054220/http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2003/09/bleeding-heart-libertarianism.html#|archive-date=2012-05-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has been used sporadically by a number of libertarian writers including [[Anthony Gregory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory32.html|title=Don't Privatize Plunder|last=Gregory|first=Anthony|publisher=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618072835/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory32.html#|archive-date=2015-06-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryan Caplan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Who's More Irresponsible?|last=Caplan|first=Bryan|publisher=EconLog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, a group of academic philosophers, political theorists, and economists created the Bleeding Heart Libertarians blog.&lt;ref name=BHL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2011/03/bleeding-heart-libertarianism/|title=Bleeding-Heart Libertarianism|last=Zwolinski|first=Matt|publisher=Bleeding Heart Libertarians blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular contributors to the blog include [[Fernando Tesón]], [[Gary Chartier]], [[Jason Brennan]], [[Roderick T.

[[File:Discurso de Perón.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]] is the central symbol in the [[Justicialist Party|Peronist party]]]]
[[File:Eva Perón Discurso.jpg|thumb|[[Eva Perón]] claims the female vote in 1947]]
'''Peronism''' ({{lang-es|peronismo}}) or '''Justicialism''' (''justicialismo'') is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] political movement based on the political ideology and legacy of former President [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]] and his second wife [[Eva Perón]].

The Peronist's [[Justicialist Party]] (''Partido Justicialista'') derives its name from the concept of [[social justice]] ({{lang-es|justicia social}}).

Since its inception in 1946, Peronist candidates have won nine of the 12 presidential elections from which they have not been banned. As of 2018, Perón was the only Argentine to have been elected president three times.

==Overview==
The pillars of the Peronist ideal, known as the "three flags", are social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty. Peronism can be described as a [[third position]] [[ideology]] as it rejects both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]. Peronism espouses [[corporatism]] and thus aims to mediate tensions between the classes of society, with the state responsible for negotiating compromise in conflicts between managers and workers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

However, it is a generally ill-defined ideology as different and sometimes contradictory sentiments are expressed in the name of Peronism. Today, the legacy and thought of Perón have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina; therefore Peronists are usually described as a [[political movement]]. Traditionally, the Peronist movement has drawn its strongest support from the [[working class]] and sympathetic [[Trade union|unions]] and has been characterized as [[proletarian]] in nature.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

From the perspective of opponents, Peronism is an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] ideology. Perón was often compared to [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Dictator|dictators]], accused of [[demagoguery]] and his policies{{which|date=October 2018}} derided as [[populism|populist]]. Proclaiming himself the embodiment of nationality, Perón's government often silenced dissent by accusing opponents of being unpatriotic. The corporatist character of Peronism drew attacks from [[socialists]] who accused his administration of preserving capitalist exploitation and class division. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] rejected its modernist ideology and felt their status threatened by the ascent of the Peronist [[wiktionary:apparat|apparat]]. [[Liberalism|Liberals]] condemned the Perón regime's arbitrariness and dictatorial tendencies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Defenders of Peronism also describe the [[doctrine]] as populist, albeit in the sense that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Perón in esteem for his administration's [[anti-imperialism]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] as well as its socially [[progressivism|progressive]] initiatives. Amongst other measures introduced by Perón's governments, [[social security]] was made universal while education was made free to all who qualified and working students were given one paid week before every major examination. Vast low-income housing projects were created and paid vacations became standard. All workers (including [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] employees) were guaranteed free medical care and half of their vacation-trip expenses and mothers-to-be received three paid months off prior to and after giving birth. Workers' recreation centers were also constructed throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Perón's policies==
{{History of Argentina}}
Perón's ideas were widely embraced by a variety of different groups in Argentina across the political spectrum. Perón's personal views later became a burden on the ideology, see for example his [[anti-clericalism]], which did not strike a sympathetic chord with upper-class Argentinians.

Peronism is widely regarded as a form of corporate socialism, or "[[right-wing socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/13/world/buenos-aires-journal-carlos-carlos-how-does-your-economy-sink.html "Buenos Aires Journal"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 13 January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Perón's public speeches were consistently [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[populism|populist]]. It would be difficult to separate Peronism from [[corporate nationalism]], for Perón nationalized Argentina's large corporations, blurring distinctions between corporations and government. At the same time, the [[labor union]]s became corporate, ceding the right to strike in agreements with Perón as Secretary of Welfare in the military government from 1943–1945. In exchange, the state was to assume the role of negotiator between conflicting interests.

Peronism also lacked a strong interest in matters of [[foreign policy]] other than the belief that the political and economic influences of other nations should be kept out of Argentina—he was somewhat [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Early in his presidency, Perón envisioned Argentina's role as a model for other countries in Latin America and beyond, but such ideas were ultimately abandoned. Despite his oppositional rhetoric, Perón frequently sought cooperation with the United States government on various issues.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Chronicle of an Inconclusive Negotiation: Perón, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank (1946–1955)|url=http://hahr.dukejournals.org/content/92/4/637.abstract|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Perón===
Political opponents sustain that Perón and his administration resorted to organized violence and dictatorial rule; that Perón showed contempt for any opponents; and regularly characterized them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Perón maintained the institutions of democratic rule, but subverted freedoms through such actions as nationalizing the broadcasting system, centralizing the unions under his control and monopolizing the supply of newspaper print. At times, Perón also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including [[Radical Civic Union]] leader [[Ricardo Balbin]]; and shutting down opposition papers, such as ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]''.

Perón's admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]] is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Political Ideologies |last=Eatwell |first=Roger |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8264-5173-6 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars categorize Peronism as a [[Fascism|fascist]] ideology.&lt;ref name="peronism"&gt;Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&amp;q=Fayt#v=snippet&amp;q=Fayt&amp;f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Fayt]] believes that Peronism was just "an Argentine implementation of [[Italian fascism]]".&lt;ref name="peronism"/&gt; Hayes{{Clarify|reason=who is Hayes?|date=May 2016}} reaches the conclusion that "the Peronist movement produced a form of fascism that was distinctively Latin American".&lt;ref name="peronism"/&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. After Perón ascended to the presidency in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of [[caudillo]]s, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' or ''[[Don Segundo Sombra|Don Segundo]]'' that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.&lt;ref&gt;''Borges: A Life''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Attitudes towards Jews===
Perón's ideology was economic and political in character and did not feature the [[antisemitism]] of [[Nazism]].

Before Perón came to power in Argentina, the country had the largest Jewish population in Latin America. After becoming president, he invited members of the Jewish community to participate in his government. One of his advisors was [[José Ber Gelbard]], a Jewish man from Poland. Peronism did not have antisemitic or other bias.&lt;ref&gt;Crassweller, David. ''Perón and the Enigmas of Argentina''. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987. p. 221. {{ISBN|0-393-30543-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Virtual Library]] writes that while Juan Perón had sympathized with the Axis powers, "Perón also expressed sympathy for Jewish rights and established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949. Since then, more than 45,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from Argentina".&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Rebecca. [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Argentina.html#WW2 "Post World War II"]. Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem'', author Laurence Levine, also former president of the U.S.–Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that "although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Perón's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Laurence. ''Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem: 1950–2000 From an American Point of View''. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; While Perón allowed many Nazi criminals to take refuge in Argentina, he also attracted many Jewish immigrants. Argentina has a Jewish population of over 200,000 citizens, the largest in Latin America and one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Valente, Marcela. [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/education/diplomacy/argentina-75/continuing-efforts-conceal/ "Continuing Efforts to Conceal Anti-Semitic Past"]. IPS-Inter Press Service. 27 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peronism after Perón==
===The fall of Perón===
A military and civilian coup, the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', led by General [[Eduardo Lonardi]], overthrew the Perón regime in 1955. During the coup, Lonardi drew analogies between Perón and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. Lonardi used the quote "neither victors nor vanquished" ({{lang-es|link=no|ni vencedores ni vencidos}}), which was used by [[Justo José de Urquiza]] after deposing Rosas in the [[battle of Caseros]]. The official perspective was that Perón was "the second tyranny", the first one being Rosas; and that both ones should be equally rejected and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end, they draw the line of historical continuity "[[May Revolution|May]] – [[Battle of Caseros|Caseros]] – [[Revolución Libertadora|Libertadora]]", matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular, so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto. pp. 278–281.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity "[[José de San Martín|San Martín]] – [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] – [[Juan Perón|Perón]]".&lt;ref name="tres"&gt;Chaneton. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of Perón, who lived for 16 years in exile in [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]], is an important key to understanding Peronism. After he went into exile, he could be invoked by a variety of Argentine sectors opposed to the current state of affairs. In particular, the [[personality cult]] of [[Eva Perón]] was conserved by supporters while despised by the "national [[bourgeoisie]]". In the 1960s, John William Cooke's writings became an important source of left-wing revolutionary Peronism. Left-wing Peronism was represented by many organizations, from the [[Montoneros]] and the [[Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas]] to the Peronist Youth, the Frente Revolucionario Peronista and the Revolutionary Peronist Youth, passing by Peronismo en Lucha or Peronismo de Base, which supported a [[Marxist]] viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Navarrazo"&gt;Servetto, Alice. [http://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar:8180/publicaciones/bitstream/1/681/1/ES_9_17_1999_pag_91_109.pdf "El derrumbe temprano de la democracia en Córdoba: Obregón Cano y el golpe policial (1973-1974)"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706083051/http://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar:8180/publicaciones/bitstream/1/681/1/ES_9_17_1999_pag_91_109.pdf|date=6 July 2011}} ''Estudios Sociales''. n° 17. Late 1999, revised paper of a 1997 conference at the [[National University of La Pampa]], 19 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, older Peronists formed the base of the orthodox bureaucracy, represented by the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica ([[Augusto Vandor]], famous for his 1965 slogan "For a Peronism without Perón" and declaring as well that "to save Perón, one has to be against Perón", or [[José Ignacio Rucci]]). Another current was formed by the "62 Organizaciones 'De pie junto a Perón'", led by [[José Alonso (trade unionist)|José Alonso]] and opposed to the right-wing Peronist unionist movement. In the early 1970s, left-wing Peronism rejected liberal democracy and political pluralism as the mask of bourgeois domination. The anti-communist right-wing Peronism also rejected it in the name of corporatism, claiming to return to a "Christian and humanist, popular, national socialism".&lt;ref name="Navarrazo"/&gt;

===Perón restored===
By 1970, many groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum had come to support Perón, from the left-wing and Catholic [[Montoneros]] to the fascist-leaning and strongly antisemitic [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]], one of Argentina's first [[guerrilla]] movements. In March 1973, [[Héctor José Cámpora]], who had been named as Perón's personal delegate, was [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elected President of Argentina]], paving the way for the return of Perón from Spain. A few months after Perón's return and the subsequent [[Ezeiza massacre]] during which the Peronist Left and Right violently clashed, [[Argentine general election, September 1973|new elections]] were held in September with Perón elected president and his third wife Isabel vice president.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt;

José Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, had been replaced temporarily by interim President [[Raúl Alberto Lastiri]] while Perón had chosen to openly support the Peronist right. On 1 October 1973, Senator Humberto Martiarena, who was the national secretary of the Superior Council of the National Justicialist Movement, publicized a document giving directives to confront "subversives, terrorist and Marxist groups" which had allegedly initiated a "war" inside the Peronist organizations.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt; From then on, the Superior Council took a firm grip on the Peronist organizations to expel the Left from it.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo/&gt;

On that same day, a meeting took place among President [[Raúl Lastiri]], Interior Minister Benito Llambí, Social Welfare Minister [[José López Rega]], general secretary of the Presidency José Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors, which has been alleged to have been the foundational act of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] [[death squad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaggero, Manuel Justo.  [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-80601-2007-02-19.html "El general en su laberinto"]. ''[[Pagina/12]]''. 19 February 
2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perón's health was failing throughout his third and final term, which ended abruptly with his death and the succession of his wife to the presidency on 1 July 1974, but she was ousted by the military in another ''coup d'état'' in 1976, paving the way for the ensuing dictatorship's '"[[National Reorganization Process]]" and the subsequent "[[Dirty War]]" against everyone deemed [[subversion|subversive]], especially leftists, including left-wing Peronists.

===Menem years===
[[File:Kirchner en Gualeguaychú 5-may-2006 3-presidencia-govar.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Néstor Kirchner]] addressing a multitude at Gualeguaychú]]
The official Peronist party is the [[Justicialist Party]] (PJ), which was the only Peronist party for a long time. During the government of [[Carlos Menem]], a group of legislators led by [[Carlos Álvarez (politician)|Carlos Álvarez]] known as the "Group of 8" left the party, claiming that the government was not following Peronist doctrines. They created a new party, the [[Broad Front (Argentina)|Broad Front]].

A short time later, [[José Octavio Bordón]] left the PJ as well, fearing that he might lose a [[primary election]] against Menem and thus he created his own party to take part in the [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 elections]] and allied with Álvarez' Broad Front in the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity]] (Frepaso) coalition. Similar breakaway movements followed frequently after that, creating many small parties which were led by single politicians claiming to be the authentic inheritors of Peronism.

===Kirchnerism===
{{Further|Kirchnerism}}
The PJ did not participate as such during the [[Argentine general election, 2003|2003 elections]]. The party allowed all three precandidates to run for the general elections, using small parties created for that purpose. [[Néstor Kirchner]] won the elections running on a [[Front for Victory]] ticket. As he did not disband his party after the election, Kirchnerism relies on both the PJ and the Front for Victory.

In 2004, Chilean [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]] [[Ignacio Walker]] wrote a column in ''[[El Mercurio]]'' criticizing Peronism stating it had "Fascistoid", "authoritarian" and "corporative" traits. He added that "I tend to think the real wall that separates Chile from Argentina is not the Andes but the  legacy of Peronism and its perverse logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2004/10/04/160124/ignacio-walker-nuestros-vecinos-argentinos.html|title=Ignacio Walker: "Nuestros vecinos argentinos"|last=Walker|first=Ignacio|date=6 May 2004|newspaper=[[El Mercurio]]|access-date=26 May 2014|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after Walker had written this column, he was appointed [[chancellor]] and the surfacing of his previous statements caused a diplomatic impasse between Chile and Peronist-ruled Argentina. A similar situation happened again in 2006, when it was made known that Chilean minister [[Andrés Velasco]] had referred to some Peronist leaders as having "fascist traits" and had supported Walker's analysis in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/2006/03/20/214075/resurgen-en-argentina-polemicos-dichos-de-velasco-sobre-el-peronismo.html|title=Resurgen en Argentina polémicos dichos de Velasco sobre el peronismo|last=|first=|date=20 March 2006|newspaper=[[El Mercurio]]|access-date=26 May 2014|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">A '''Planning and Zoning Commission''' is a local [[election|elected]] or appointed [[government]] board charged with recommending to the local town or city council the boundaries of the various original [[zoning]] district and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein and any proposed amendments thereto and shall collect data and keep itself informed as to the best practices generally in effect in the matter city planning and zoning to the end that it may be qualified to act on measures affecting the present and future movement of traffic, the segregation of residential and business districts and the convenience and safety of persons and property in any way dependent on city planning and zoning. Some jurisdictions may refer to them also planning commissions, planning boards, zoning commissions, and zoning boards.

The [[chairman]] of the Planning and Zoning Commission (or a staff member) is responsible for publishing public hearing in the newspaper about certain matters that come before the commission.  Most [[municipal]] or [[County (United States)|county]] Planning and Zoning Commissions consist of five to seven members.  This number does not include alternates. In some states, planning and zoning commissions are regional or county.

Some communities elect planning and zoning commission members.  In other [[jurisdictions]], the Planning and Zoning Commissioners are appointed by the [[Mayor]] or [[First Selectman]] of the [[city]] or [[town]] and approved by the city's legislative body, i.e. [[city council]], [[board of aldermen]], etc. (some planning commissioners are appointed by the City Commission as a whole). 

Please note that planning and zoning commissions may also be approving agencies for development permits, variances to the zoning code. Other jurisdictions may have separate zoning board of adjustments or appeals appointed by the governing body that perform the function instead of the planning and zoning commission doing it. Some jurisdictions have featured court appointed zoning boards/boards of adjustment and appeals due to the quasi-judicial functions.

A central question in political philosophy is "To what extent is political authority legitimate?" Views range from political authority having no legitimacy ([[philosophical anarchism]]) to political authority being virtually unlimited in scope ([[totalitarianism]]).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

The era may be marked by unstable coalitions and policy compromises,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Shalal]], "German Social Democrats Face Pressure over Coalition Talks", Reuters, 22 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; discontinuity of purpose, frequent changes of government, corruption, and denial.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schenker]], ''Lebanon's Stagnation'', [[The Washington Institute]], 19 December 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional politics being seen to fail, there may be an increase in scapegoating, victimization, rioting, rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbas Alnasrawi]], ''Arab Nationalism, Oil, and the Political Economy of Dependency'',  Greenwood Publishing, 1991, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; terrorism, attempted [[coup d'etat|coups d'etat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] editorial: "Ankara's Shame", 21 April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; assassinations, or other revenge missions.

==History of the concept==

[[Ibn Khaldun]] observed periods, following 'expansion to the limit', when 'the habit of subservience' generated 'lies, ruses and deceit', and possibly a 'split in the dynasty'.&lt;ref&gt;Muqadimmah, Routledge, 2001, p255&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Kennedy]], 'Great powers in relative decline instinctively respond by spending more on 'security' and thereby…compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kennedy]], [[The Rise and Fall of The Great Powers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an [[ideocracy]], Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn see self-destruction as a factor in ideological stagnation. The ideocracy may split into 'warring camps'. It may be ended by a military coup, as in [[Peronist]] [[Argentina]]. There may be a popular rebellion. The economy may stagnate, as demands exceed ability. There may be external attacks by other states which fear the spread of the ideology,&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p149-53&lt;/ref&gt; A further possibility is peaceful erosion. A new generation matures which is less fervent and more tolerant of pluralism. Technological developments and artistic expression (for example, the plays of [[Vaclav Havel]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]) erode faith in the ideology. The leadership become a less-effective self-serving, careerist elite.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p154-61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

According to Bruno S. Sergi,&lt;ref&gt;'Misinterpreting Modern Russia', Bloomsbury, 2011, chapter nine&lt;/ref&gt; Russia experienced 'transformative' leadership under [[Peter the Great]], [[Catherine the Great]], [[Tsar Alexander II]], [[Lenin]] and [[Gorbachev]], but stagnation followed in each case. The USSR is said to have suffered stagnation between the early 1970s and its collapse from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] under [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] stagnated between 1945-1949 when it failed to deal with the communist threat.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Roger Louis]], ''The British Empire in the Middle East, 1945-1951'', Oxford University Press, 1984, chapter three&lt;/ref&gt; His son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] experienced, according to Andrew Scott Cooper, 'economic slowdown, corruption, youth rebellion, a revolutionary underclass, and pressure for reform'. The Shah relied on his [[White revolution]], repression, and the oil boom, but these all failed to keep his regime in power.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Scott Cooper, ''The Fall of Heaven: the Pahlavis and the final days of Iran'', Henry Holt, 2016, p214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Callaghan]] and [[Steve Fielding]]&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting The Labour Party'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2003, p 151&lt;/ref&gt; say that postwar Britain suffered from 'pluralistic stagnation' between 1945–1979 when both parties endorsed the corporatist consensus.

In [[Israel]] adherence to the original socialist ideology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Yakir Plesner]], 'The Political Economy of Israel', [[Middle East Quarterly]], March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and fading hopes for a [[two-state solution]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dahlia Scheindlin]], 'Israelis now face a fateful choice as hopes for a two=state solution fade', [[The Guardian]], 1/1/2017&lt;/ref&gt; are factors causing stagnation according to commentators.

[[File:Luxembourg Referendum 2015 Postal vote - ballot and other documents.jpg|thumb|Ballot and other documents for postal voting for the [[Luxembourg constitutional referendum, 2015]]]]
'''Postal voting''' is [[voting]] in an election whereby ballot papers are distributed to electors or returned by post, in contrast to electors voting in person at a [[polling place|polling station]] or electronically via an [[electronic voting]] system. Historically, postal votes must be distributed and placed in return mail before the scheduled [[election day]], it is sometimes referred to as a form of [[early voting]]. It can also be used as an [[absentee ballot]].  However, in recent times the model in the US has morphed, in municipalities that use postal voting exclusively, to be one of ballots being mailed out to voters, but the return method taking on alternatives of return by mail or dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes and/or voting centers. 

Postal voting refers only to the means by which the ballots are submitted, not to the method by which the votes are counted. Election officials may count the votes by processing the mailed-in ballots through electronic [[voting machine]]s, or may count the votes manually.

To enable as many voters as possible to participate, postal voting can assist people who may not be able to attend a polling station in person, for example because of a physical disability, absence from the locality or some other reason. Postal voting is generally available to voters upon application, sometimes with restrictions. If no reason for a request is required, it may be called '''postal vote on demand'''. Postal voting may be an option for voters in some jurisdictions, while in some elections there may be '''all-postal voting'''.

A form of postal voting was introduced in Western Australia in 1877, followed by an improved method in South Australia in 1890.&lt;ref name="atsod"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia: The State of Democracy |last=Sawer |first=Marian |author2=Norman Abjorensen |author3=Philip Larkin  |year=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=1862877254 |pages=107–114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F09pc74M9NMC |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, concerns about postal voting have been raised as to whether it complies with the requirements of a secret ballot, in that people cast their vote outside the security of a polling station, and whether voters can cast their vote privately free from another person's coercion. There have been cases of [[electoral fraud]] with postal votes in the United Kingdom (including in Birmingham at the [[United Kingdom elections, 2004|2004 European and local government elections in the UK]]).&lt;ref name="Judge upholds vote-rigging claims"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4406575.stm |title=Judge upholds vote-rigging claims |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politics.guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hugh Muir, Sandra Laville and Audrey Gillan |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election/story/0,15803,1458341,00.html |title=New fears over postal vote fraud |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date= 2005-04-13|accessdate=2010-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1564522,00.html Labour to halt postal vote fraud but only after election (Times, April 11, 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109115209/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1564522,00.html |date=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==All-postal voting==
''All-postal'' voting is the form of postal voting where all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the system applied, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post, or there may be an opportunity to deliver them by hand to a specified location.

There is some evidence that this method of voting leads to higher turnout than one where people vote in person or have to apply for a postal vote. Critics suggest that this is only a temporary impact, and that there are dangers in people using ballot papers intended for other electors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

It has been tested by a large number of local authorities in the [[United Kingdom]] for their elections, and in 2004 it was used for elections to the European Parliament and local authorities in four of the English regions (see below for more details).

==Experience of postal voting and all-postal voting by country==
===France===
France had absentee voting until the 1970s, when it was abolished because they were classified as a security risk in terms of vote-rigging.

===Germany===
Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have had the opportunity to participate in elections. Like in many other countries, in more recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, [http://network.gruene-washington.de/SitePages/briefwahl2017.aspx various tools] are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting.

===Italy===
[[File:Plico elettorale Italia 2013.jpg|thumb|Electoral package sent to an Italian voter in South America during the [[Italian general election, 2013]].]]
Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all referendums and national elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate).

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], opposition leader and former deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]] alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|date=March 3, 2008|title=Malaysian oppn accuse govt of postal vote fraud|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/03/2177581.htm|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] had actually won during the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 elections]], before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun (Malaysia)|date=March 27, 2008|title=One foot in the door|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/news_features/one_foot_in_the_door.html|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes.

===Mexico===
[[File:Boleta electoral marcada, de las elecciones federales de México de 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Postal ballot paper for Mexico federal election 2012]]
In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the [[National Electoral Institute]] which then sends the ballots outside the country.

===Philippines===
{{Main|Elections in the Philippines#Voting}}
Mail-in ballots are an option for [[Overseas Filipinos]] in select countries only. The general practise for local and overseas absentee voting in [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippine]] elections requires that ballots be cast in person at select polling places, such as a [[Consulate|consulate office]].

===Spain===
In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Voting in Switzerland}}
Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=161.1|link=161_1|art=8|en=Federal Statute on Political Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back.

===United States===
[[File:Early voting US states.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|No-excuse early voting in U.S. states, as of September 2014.

'''Vote-by-mail''' (also known as '''Vote from Home'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/janfeb-2016/vote-from-home-save-your-country/|title=Vote from Home, Save Your Country|date=2016-01-10|work=Washington Monthly|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a variation of postal voting in the United States in which a [[ballot]] is mailed to the [[home]] of a registered voter, the voter fills it out and returns it via postal mail or drops off the ballot in-person into a secure drop box or at a voting center. This process eliminates the requirements to staff and run a polling center during an election and can result in considerable cost savings to the state.&lt;ref name="pewt_Colo"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Colorado Voting Reforms: Early Results |work=pewtrusts.org |date=March 22, 2016 |access-date=25 October 2018 |url= https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2016/03/colorado-voting-reforms-early-results }}&lt;/ref&gt; Balloting materials may be sent via the United States Postal Service without prepayment of postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/703.htm#wp1114319 |title=USPS DMM 703.8 |publisher=Pe.usps.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ballots are sent out around three weeks before the election date, after a voter's pamphlet has been distributed. To vote by mail, an individual marks the ballot for their choice of the candidates (or writes in their name), places the ballot in a secrecy envelope, seals it, places it in the provided mailing envelope, seals it and signs and dates the back of the mailing envelope. This envelope is then either stamped and mailed at any mailbox, or dropped off (postage free) at a local ballot collection center.

[[File:Oregon ballot return box.jpg|thumb|A vote-by-mail ballot is returned to a ballot drop box.]]
There is a cut off date for mailing ballots and it is determined by the local voting jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, postmarks do not count, and ballots must be received by a certain time on election day. In other jurisdictions, a ballot must have a postmark on or before the day of the election and be received prior to the date of certification. Many vote-by-mail jurisdictions enlist the help of volunteers to take ballots in walk up Drop off Booths or drive-up Quick Drop locations. The [[Help America Vote Act]] requires some polling options, often at central election headquarters, with machines designed for voting by those disabled who cannot vote a normal ballot.

In the 2016 US Presidential election, approximately 33 million ballots were cast via mailed out ballots (about 25% of all ballots cast). That was from a combination of the 100% vote by mail jurisdictions plus absentees elsewhere. In 2016, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report outlining the turnout improvements seen in vote by mail elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Elections: Issues Related to Registering Voters and Administering Elections |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office (U.S. GAO) |date=June 2016 |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/678131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a report from the US Senate Intelligence Committee of Russian meddling in the 2016 election pointed out that paper ballots, by definition part of all vote by mail elections, were inherently safer than electronic voting systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Russian Targeting of Election Infrastructure During The 2016 Election: Summary of Draft SSCI Recommendations |url= https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ef45f5_32dc275babf6443eb608d8340f4e964e.pdf |publisher=US Senate Intelligence Committee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, some [[electoral fraud]] has occurred over the years involving political operatives illegally aiding those eligible to vote by mail, usually voters over 65 years of age or voters with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====States with all vote-by-mail elections====
[[Image:Oregon special election ballot.jpg|thumb|125px|An Oregon mail-in ballot for a special election in May 2005.]]

In 1998, voters in [[Oregon]] passed an [[Oregon Ballot Measure 60 (1998)|initiative]] requiring that all elections be conducted by mail. Voters may also drop their ballots off at a [[County (United States)|county]] designated official drop site. Oregon has since reduced the cost of elections, and the time available to tally votes has increased. Oregon requires receipt of votes by 8:00{{nbsp}}pm local time on election day. County elections offices collect from post offices at their closing time on election day and from drop boxes at 8:00{{nbsp}}pm election day. Any valid ballot received by 8:00{{nbsp}}pm local time on election day by any county is required to be counted, unless the cumulative votes of any valid ballots transferred to the relevant county elections office after the closing of the polls cannot change the outcome of the election for any given seat.

In 2011, the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] legislature passed a law requiring all counties to conduct vote-by-mail elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2013, [[Colorado]] began holding all elections by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx#mail|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A Pantheon Analytics study of the 2014 election showed a significant uptick in voter participation from what would have normally been "low propensity" voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Showalter |first1=Amelia |title=Colorado 2014: Analysis of Predicted and Actual Turnout |url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ef45f5_e8b1a125bf7644c9bab0572a7062a960.pdf |publisher=Pantheon Analytics |accessdate=7 November 2018 |format=PDF |date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PEW Charitable Trust study of the same election showed significant cost savings.&lt;ref name="pewt_Colo"/&gt;

in 2014, [[Utah]] started allowing each county to make their own decision regarding whether to go to 100% mailed-out ballots. In the 2016 general election, 21 of their 29 counties did so. That rose to 27 of 29 counties in 2018, covering over 98% of their electorate.  A Pantheon Analytics study of Utah's 2016 general election showed a 5-7% point higher turnout in the counties using vote by mail than those with traditional polling places, with even higher differences (~10% points) among younger voters. 

In 2016, [[California]] passed SB 450 which authorizes a roll-out of vote by mail across the state, at county discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Voter's Choice Act |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/ |website=www.sos.ca.gov |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five counties will do so in 2018. For 2020, all counties will be authorized to do so, except Los Angeles County, which will be authorized in 2022.

====Controversy====
[[Project Vote]] published their findings in a 2007 article titled "Vote-by-Mail Doesn't Deliver" by
Michael Slater and Teresa James. The article's conclusion states,

{{quote|Thanks largely to Oregon's experience, many reform-minded advocates and policymakers have become persuaded that vote-by-mail stimulates increased voter turnout with few drawbacks. We think the facts don't support their arguments. VBM reinforces the stratification of the electorate; it's more amenable to both fraud and manipulation than voting at polling places; and it depends too much on the reliability of the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Slater and Teresa James |url=http://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2011/02/vote-by-mail-doesnt-deliver-slater.doc |title=Vote-by-Mail Doesn't Deliver |publisher=Tompaine.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Oregon (the original Vote-by-Mail state), more than half of voters now choose to drop off ballots. The states of Colorado and Washington have followed suit, with California starting to roll out in 2018.  Utah will hit 98% of voters in this model in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/oregon-voter-turnout-high|title=Why Voter Turnout In Oregon Is Incredibly High|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/25/14092264-the-real-vote-fraud-opportunity-has-arrived-casting-your-ballot-by-mail|title=The real vote-fraud opportunity has arrived: casting your ballot by mail|first=|last=Investigations|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Get out the Vote===
VBM Changes [[Get out the vote]] (GOTV) in a big way.
With VBM a government no longer has to get people to the vote center on election day, a government only has to collect their ballots and take those easily portable envelopes to a vote center or VBM drop site. This makes GOTV a lot easier, but it also makes fraud possible.  There are already apocryphal stories and urban legends about people collecting ballots and dumping them. There is very little evidence for actual fraud. Some jurisdictions have set limits in an attempt to reduce putative fraud:  New Jersey and Colorado limit agents to 10 and 3 ballots respectively; Oregon too has limits.  Face to face GOTV has been found to be less effective with VBM. &lt;ref&gt; Arceneaux, Kevin and Kousser, Thad and Mullin, Megan, Get Out the Vote-by-Mail?

====Alternatives====
An increasing number of states in the USA now allow [[drive-thru voting]]. In the process voters leave their absentee ballots in a drop box at designated locations. Some locations allow drop-off voting 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/11/it-is-time-for.html |title=It's Time for Drive-Thru Voting |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date= November 4, 2008|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It turns out that more and more states are adopting the Colorado model, providing voters with multiple ways to return their ballot: by mail, via in person secure drop boxes, and at voting centers where they can get questions answered, replacement ballots, etc. Oregon now has 300 drop boxes across the state in the weeks leading up to each election, and in fact more voters now cast their ballot in person than by return mail.  The term "Vote at Home" is starting to replace "Vote by mail" for that reason.  California's roll-out of vote by mail is incorporating voting centers as a key part of their effort.  Anchorage's successful pilot included many drop boxes and some voting centers.

===United Kingdom===

==== History ====
Voting at elections originally took place by way of a public show of hands or by a public ballot. The right to vote by secret ballot was introduced by the ''Parliamentary and Municipal Elections Act 1872'' (the ''[[Ballot Act 1872]]''). After this voting took place at polling stations where voters marked their votes in secret and placed their ballot papers in a closed box.

Absent voting was first introduced for the immediate post-war period in 1918 for servicemen and others prevented ''‘by reason of the nature of their occupation…from voting at a poll''' by the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]''. Armed forces still serving overseas at the end of World War I were allowed to vote by post, and permanent arrangements were made for proxy voting by servicemen. The ''[[Representation of the People Act 1945]]'' again made temporary provision for postal voting by service voters. Postal voting was not extended to civilians until 1948 when the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1948]]'' granted postal voting facilities to both service personnel and to certain groups of civilians including those who were physically incapacitated, those unable to vote without making a journey by sea or air or because of the nature of their occupation, and those who were no longer residing at their qualifying address. All had to provide an address in the UK to which ballot papers could be sent. Service personnel could, alternatively, vote by proxy if they were likely to be at sea or abroad on polling day.

In 1983, in its review of electoral law, the Home Affairs Select Committee criticised the categories of absent voters who were allowed to vote by post. The Committee made clear that they would not wish absent voting facilities to be made available to everybody on demand but recommended that "the Home Office should review the existing criteria for eligibility for absent voting facilities, and in particular we suggest that it would be permissible to apply for a postal vote due to absence “by reason of employment”, without the necessity to distinguish between one type of employment or another."&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Acts, Report of the Home Affairs Select Committee, HC 32 1982-83, para 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also called for voters absent on holiday to have the right to apply for a postal vote. The Government responded to the Committee's report in January 1984 and expressed some concern at the increased opportunities for electoral abuse offered by absent voting (especially postal voting) and in particular by the standing arrangements made for those allowed an absent vote for an indefinite period. However, the Government's response was summed up as follows:

* First, apart from service voters and electors resident abroad, the right to apply for an absent vote for an indefinite period should in general be confined to those who are unable or likely to be unable to vote in person on polling day (or to vote unaided) through blindness or other physical incapacity. (The special arrangements for those unable to reach the polling station from their qualifying address without a sea or air journey would continue unchanged).
* Second, the right to apply for an absent vote at a particular Parliamentary, European Parliament or local election in Great Britain should be extended to all those who for whatever reason are unable or likely to be unable to vote in person on polling day. This would benefit holiday makers, people who are away in the course of employment and all other electors who although prevented from voting in person on polling day may not apply under existing provisions.
 
The ''Representation of the People Act 1985'' subsequently made provision for these extensions to the right to apply for an absent vote. The proposals did not apply to Northern Ireland where there was already widespread concern, shared by the Government, at the extent and nature of electoral abuse, including the abuse of postal voting. Further amendments were made to the rules governing absent voting in the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1989]]''.

By 1999 the system of postal and proxy voting for those unable to vote at polling stations was seen as cumbersome and complex. A Working Party on Electoral Procedures chaired by [[George Howarth]], Minister of State at the Home Office, published its report in October 1999. The working party recommended that

* Absent voting should be allowed on demand
*The application and voting procedures for absent voting should be simplified

The ''[[Representation of the People Act 2000]]'' implemented the Howarth report's recommendations. ''The Representation of the People (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2001'' introduced the changes to the absent voting arrangements from 16 February 2001. The main change was to allow postal voting on demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03667.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, any elector has been entitled to request a postal vote (known as ''postal voting on demand'') without giving a reason,&lt;ref name="House of Commons Library Research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03667.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423150329/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03667.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from in [[Northern Ireland]], where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Prior to 2001, postal votes had been available since 1948 only to those unable to attend a polling station for reasons of ill health, employment or planned holiday away from home and to some electors living on small islands where they would need to cross water to reach their polling station. Before 1985, holidays were not a sufficient reason, and the employment criterion allowed only some professions.

====Procedure====

Registered voters who wish to vote by post must submit an additional application form to the Electoral Registration Officer at their [[local authority]] (or to the [[Electoral Office for Northern Ireland]] if in [[Northern Ireland]]) stating whether they want their ballot paper to be sent for one single election, all elections until a specified date or indefinitely. They must also submit their date of birth, and signature specimen on the form (or apply for a grant of a signature waiver due to a disability or inability to read or write&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 2000]], Schedule 4, Paragraphs 3(8), 4(5) and 7(11)&lt;/ref&gt;).  In addition, if a person eligible to vote in the [[United Kingdom]] is chosen by another voter to be his/her proxy, the proxy can apply to vote by post.  To receive a postal vote for an election, the postal vote application must have been received by the Electoral Registration Officer by 5 p.m. eleven working days before polling day.

Returning officers issue and despatch postal ballot packs at 5 p.m. on the eleventh working day before polling day at the earliest.  Issue of postal ballots is not open to the scrutiny of candidates and their agents; by law, only the returning officers, their staff, representatives of the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and observers accredited by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] are permitted to attend. Some returning officers produce postal ballot packs in house, whilst others outsource the process to an external company.

Each postal ballot pack contains inside the cover envelope a ballot paper, two envelopes ("A" and "B") and a postal voting statement. Postal ballots are printed on paper of a colour different from that of ballots issued in polling stations.  Postal ballot papers contain the following design, security and identification features on the reverse:&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 72&lt;/ref&gt;
*an official mark (e.g. a watermark or an official stamp)
*a unique identifying mark (e.g. a barcode which is different for each individual ballot paper)
*a unique identification number
When issuing each postal ballot paper, the officer marks on a list (called the '''corresponding number list''') next to the postal ballot's unique identification number the elector number of the voter to whom the postal ballot is sent, and then makes a mark next to the voter's name in a separate list of postal voters.  The unique identification number of the postal ballot paper is also marked on the postal voting statement sent within the postal ballot pack.  The local authority name and address and the name of the constituency/ward are printed on both envelopes "A" and "B".  Once all ballot papers for an election have been issued by the returning officer, the '''corresponding number list''' is sealed in a packet which can only be opened upon the order of a court when an election result is challenged.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 75(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 75(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receipt of the postal ballot pack, the voter completes the ballot paper according to the instructions and seals it inside the envelope marked "A". A separate postal voting statement must be filled in by the voter with his/her date of birth and signature (unless a signature waiver has been granted or if the voter is an anonymous elector).  It is strongly recommended that postal voting statement and envelope "A" (containing the ballot paper) be placed and sealed inside the larger envelope "B" when returned, although this is not a requirement.  The vote can be posted back to the returning officer at the local authority address (postage is prepaid when returned from within the United Kingdom), or returned in person to the returning officer at the local authority office, or directly handed in to a polling station on polling day (but only one which is situated within the constituency/ward marked on envelopes "A"/"B").&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 79(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 79(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the vote to be counted, it must ''reach'' the returning officer/polling station by the close of poll (usually 10 p.m. on polling day).

Upon receipt of a postal ballot pack in the post (or of the postal ballot paper and postal voting statement if sent separately), the returning officer places it inside the '''postal voters' ballot box''' allocated to the particular constituency/ward.  If a presiding officer receives a postal ballot pack in a polling station, it is sealed inside a packet which is later delivered to the returning officer at the close of poll together with a form recording the number of postal ballot packs received by the presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 79(3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 79(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and their agents, representatives of the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and observers accredited by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and entitled to observe the opening of postal ballot packs - the returning officer must give candidates and their agents at least 48 hours' written notice of the time and location of every opening session of postal ballot packs.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 80&lt;/ref&gt;  After emptying the '''postal voters' ballot box''', the postal voting statements and envelopes marked "A"/loose postal ballot papers are separated into two different groups.  The returning officer is required to verify the date of birth and signature filled in on at least 20% of the postal voting statements from each postal voters ballot box with the details provided on the original postal vote application forms.  If the details do not match, then the postal voting statement is rejected.  The returning officer makes a mark next to the name of the voter on the postal voters list for each postal voting statement received, even if it is selected for verification and rejected.  On a separate list, the returning officer must write down the unique identification numbers of postal voting statements which were chosen for verification and subsequently rejected.

The returning officer then compiles all loose postal ballot papers together with postal ballot papers having been removed from envelopes marked "A". The unique identification numbers of all rejected postal ballot papers are noted on a list.
The postal ballot papers are counted and finally placed in the '''postal ballot box(es)''', except for rejected postal ballot papers and postal ballot papers which have the same unique identification number as rejected postal voting statements.  The postal ballot box is securely sealed by the returning officer (candidates and agents can also apply their own seals).

At the count, the '''postal ballot boxes''' have their seals broken, are opened and then the postal ballot papers are counted.

Voters can contact the returning officer to check that their postal voting packs (or their postal voting statements and their postal ballot papers) have been received - however a response can only be given after an opening session since the returning officer will have to refer to the postal voters list.  At the end of an election, the marked postal voter lists are open for public inspection and also can be purchased by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], candidates, elected representatives, government departments, police forces, registered political parties and local constituency parties.

====Controversy====
There have been cases of electoral fraud with postal votes in the UK (including at the [[UK elections, 2004|2004 European and local government elections]] in Birmingham).&lt;ref name="Judge upholds vote-rigging claims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politics.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

====All-postal voting pilots====
In 2000, the UK government passed legislation to permit local authorities to apply to pilot innovations in the method of voting at local elections (including all-postal voting, [[electronic voting]], and voting at weekends), with the first pilot elections being held in May that year.

In May 2000, 2002 and 2003, many local authorities piloted all-postal voting at their local elections. In May 2003, 35 local authorities did so. The outcome of those pilots was a recommendation from the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] that all-postal voting should be adopted as the normal method of voting at local elections in the UK. This reflected the positive impact on voter turnout at these elections (in some places, turnout doubled) and the fact that there was no evidence of an increase in [[electoral fraud]].

The local elections scheduled for May 2004 were postponed to June and combined with the European Parliament elections. The UK government used this opportunity to trial all-postal voting in these elections across four [[Regions of England|regions]]: [[North East England (European Parliament constituency)|North East]], [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West]], [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands]], and [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]].

The pilots did show a significant increase in turnout where postal voting was trialled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2009.0059|title=Fewer Costs, More Votes?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">'''Public reason''' refers to a common mode of deliberation that individuals may use for issues of public concern.  The concept implicitly excludes certain assumptions or motivations that are considered improper as a basis for public decision making, even as a person may apply them in personal decisions that do not have a significant impact on the public.  

==Immanuel Kant==
The phrase "public use of one's reason" (''Vernunft in allen Stükken öffentlichen Gebrauch'') was used by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question "[[What is Enlightenment?]]," where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's "What Is Enlightenment"|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|work=An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?|accessdate=9 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160840/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[society]]. Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|title=The Idea of Public Reason Revisited|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|year=1997|volume=64|pages=765–807|doi=10.2307/1600311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual's reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family).

[[File:AntiIII%25AntiAntiRefugeeBoiseanPunk.jpg|thumb|right|A punk protests against a [[ACT! for America]] counter-protest against refugee policy in Boise, Idaho in November 2015.]]

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare Krishna===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

[[File:Fist.svg|thumb|150px|right|Painted symbol of the Power Fist]]

The '''raised fist''', or the '''clenched fist''', is a [[symbol]] of [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/22/every-movement-needs-a-symbol-enter-the-wisconsin-fist-of-solidarity/ |title=Every Movement Needs a Symbol: Enter The Wisconsin Fist of Solidarity |first=Megan |last=Gibson |publisher=Time |date=February 22, 2011 }}{{rs|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[salute]] to express unity, strength, defiance, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. 

==History==

[[File:Spanish War Children (restored).png|thumb|right|Children preparing for evacuation during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1930s), some giving the Republican salute. The Republicans showed a raised fist whereas the Nationalists gave the [[Roman salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calleja |first1=Eduardo Gonzále |chapter=The symbolism of violence during the Second Republic in Spain, 1931–1936 |title=The Splintering of Spain |chapterurl={{Google books|ypBS6N0aFJgC|page=23|plainurl=yes}} |pages=23–44 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511497025.005 |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Ealham |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Richards |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-511-49702-5 |quote=The Roman salute characteristic of Italian fascism was first adopted by the PNE and the JONS, later spreading to the Falange and other extreme right groups, before it became the official salute in Franco's Spain. The JAP salute, which consisted of stretching the right arm horizontally to touch the left shoulder enjoyed only relatively little acceptance. The gesture of the raised fist, so widespread among left-wing workers' groups, gave rise to more regimented variations, such as the salute with the fist on one's temple, characteristic of the German  ''[[Rotfrontkämpferbund|Rotfront]]'', which was adopted by the republican Popular Army. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A raised fist was used as a [[logo]] by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L. Kornbluh, Solidarity, 1917; Rebel Voices: An IWW Anthology, Charles H. Kerr Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (IWW) in 1917. However, it was popularised during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, when it was used by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] as a greeting, and was known as the "[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] salute" or the "[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute". The salute subsequently spread among leftists and anti-fascists across Europe.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17739105 |title=Breivik: What's behind clenched-fist salutes? |last=Kelly |first=Jon |date=17 April 2012 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic symbol was popularised in 1948 by [[Taller de Gráfica Popular]], a print shop in [[Mexico]] that used art to advance revolutionary social causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html|title=Mexican posters on social and educational themes|work=docspopuli.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use spread through the United States in the 1960s after artist and activist [[Frank Cieciorka]] produced a simplified version for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]: this version was subsequently used by [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name=aiga&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aiga.org/not-your-grandparent-s-clenched-fist |title=Not Your Grandparent’s Clenched Fist |last=Patton |first=Phil |date=10 January 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised fist was frequently used in propaganda posters produced during the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 revolt in France]], such as ''La Lutte continue'', depicting a factory chimney topped with a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/20180404-culture-france-may-68-posters-show-where-they-were-made-beaux-arts-paris |title=France May 68: the art of revolution |last=Hird |first=Alison |date=4 April 2018 |website=[[rfi.fr]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Considine |first1=Liam |date=Autumn 2015 |title=Screen Politics: Pop Art and the Atelier Populaire |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/24/screen-politics-pop-art-and-the-atelier-populaire |journal=Tate Papers |issn=1753-9854 |issue=24 |access-date=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/may-1968-paris.html |title=Printing a Revolution: The Posters of Paris ’68 |last=Rubin |first=Alissa J. |author-link=Alissa J.

The symbol has been picked up and incorporated around the world by various [[oppression|oppressed]] groups. In 2015 it has emerged in the southeast area of Ukraine among the [[separatists]] battling the Ukraine Kiev government forces, along with the phrase "¡No Pasarán!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Senesi |first=Vauro |date=19 January 2015 |title=Viaggio in Ucraina: al fronte di Lugansk con i ribelli filorussi.

The image gallery shows how a raised fist is used in [[visual communication]]. Combined with another [[graphic design|graphic element]], a raised fist is used to convey [[polysemous]] [[gesture]]s and opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hat4PMRx7lUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=raised%20fist&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20fist&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Meaning in Gesture|first=Geneviève|last=Calbris|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the elements combined, the meaning of the gesture changes in [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and [[intention]]. For example, a [[hammer and sickle]] combined with a raised fist is part of [[communist symbolism]], while the same fist combined with a [[Venus symbol]] represents [[Feminism]], and combined with a [[book]], it represents [[librarian]]s.

A raised-fist icon appears prominently as a feminist symbol on the covers of two major books by [[Robin Morgan]], ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'', published in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=9 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sisterhood Is Forever'', in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=7 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol had been popularised in the feminist movement during the [[Miss America protest]] in 1968 which Morgan co-organised.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A raised fist incorporates the outline of the state of Wisconsin, as designed in 2011, for union protests against the state rescinding collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wisaflcio.typepad.com/wisconsin-state-afl-cio-blog/2011/12/the-blue-fist.html|title=The Story Behind the Blue Fist - Wisconsin State AFL-CIO Blog|work=typepad.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised fist logo may represent unity or solidarity, generally with oppressed peoples. The black fist, also known as the [[Black Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[black nationalism]] and sometimes [[socialism]]. Its most widely known usage is by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s. A black fist logo was also adopted by the [[northern soul]] music [[subculture]]. The white fist, also known as the Aryan fist or the [[White Supremacy|White Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[white nationalism]].

A white fist holding a red rose is used by the [[Socialist International]] and some socialist or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party in France]] and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] occasionally use a red clenched fist on [[Northern Irish murals|murals]] depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. However, this is considered rare; the red hand is usually depicted with a flat palm.

[[Irish Republicans]] often have the raised fist as a symbol of resistance against British rule.

The Gonzo fist emblem is characterized by two thumbs and four fingers holding a [[peyote]] button, was originally used in [[Hunter S. Thompson|Hunter S. Thompson's]] 1970 campaign for sheriff of [[Aspen, Colorado]]. It has become a symbol of Thompson and [[gonzo journalism]] as a whole.

The [[Unicode]] character for the raised fist is {{unichar|270A}}.

{{Disputed section|date=February 2016}}
The raised fist salute consists of raising one arm in the air with a clenched fist. The meaning can vary based on context.

[[Image:Raised Fist at antiwar demo.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]: A woman raises her fist in solidarity with protestors opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].]]

Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, it is sometimes called the red salute, whereas amongst some African-American activists, especially in the United States it has been called the [[Black Power]] salute. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was sometimes known as the [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute.

The clenched fist gesture is sometimes thought to have originated in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the Popular Front salute was at one time the standard salute of Republican forces. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: "...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gesture—it means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Mary. Letter to Leo Hurwitz and Janey Dudley, 25 November 1938. Reprinted in Cary Nelson and Jefferson Hendricks, eds. "Madrid 1937: Letters of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the Spanish Civil War," Routledge: 1996. Reprinted online [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/scw/letters.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] [[paramilitary]] organization of [[Communist Party of Germany]] used the salute before [[World War II]] as a probable counter-gesture to the fascist salute.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, Gottfried: "Symbolgeschichte als Sozialgeschichte? Zehn vorläufige Notizen zu den Bild- und Zeichensystemen sozialer Bewegungen in Deutschland", in: Warneken, Bernd Jürgen (Hg.): "Massenmedium Strasse. Zur Kulturgeschichte der Demonstrationen." Frakfurt/Main 1991. S. 27–28. Cited in: Schulte-Rummel, Sven "Die politische Symbolik der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands in der Weimarer Republlik" [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/95026.html].
"Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Symbolen der Kommunisten beginnt die Geschichte der geballten Faust in der Ära der Weimarer Republik. Sie war prägendes Symbol bei Straßenaufmärschen, Spiegel der gewaltbereiten Demonstranten, die voller Frust über das System dem Staat die geballte Faust zeigten." Translation: "Unlikely the most of other Communists symbols, the history of Raised fist started in the era of Weimar Republic. It was a definitive symbol of street marches, reflection of the marchers who were ready for violence, who were disappointed by the whole system of the state and showed their clenched fists to it."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], medal winners [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|gave the raised fist salute]] during the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. For this, they were banned from further Olympic activities. The event was one of the most overtly political statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Lewis | first=Richard | date=2006-10-08 | title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, "Silent Gesture", that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a [[human rights]] salute.

[[Nelson Mandela]] also used the clenched fist salute upon his release from [[Victor Verster Prison]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A raised White fist is also a popular [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/raised-fist-salute-has-varied-meanings/ |title=Raised-Fist Salute Has Varied Meanings |first=J. David |last=Goodman |date=April 16, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian right-wing terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]] made a clenched-fist salute upon his conviction. Similarly [[Carlos the Jackal]] used the gesture in court, and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] raised his fist to photographers after his arrest for the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist is used by officials in Mainland China when being sworn into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/premier/news/2016/09/18/content_281475445040096.htm|title=State Council holds first swearing-in ceremony to uphold Constitution|work=english.gov.cn|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] has suggested that the appeal of the salute is that it allows the individual to indicate that they "intend to meet malevolent, massive institutional force with force of (their) own", and that they are bound in struggle with others against common oppression.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

'''Statolatry''', which combines [[idolatry]] with the [[State (polity)|state]], first appeared in [[Giovanni Gentile]]'s ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'', published in 1931 under [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s name, and was also mentioned in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks (1971) sometime between 1931-1932, while he was imprisoned by Mussolini. The same year, the [[encyclical]] ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'' by [[Pope Pius XI]] criticized [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] as developing "a [[paganism|pagan]] worship of the state" which it called "statolatry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:1beJv0ilFMwJ:www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11FAC.HTM+%22Non+Abbiamo+Bisogno%22+%22statolatry%22&amp;hl=en ''Non abbiamo bisogno'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''politiolatry''' was used to describe [[reason of state]] doctrine in the 17th century with similar intent.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, J. H. (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450-1700''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig von Mises' ''Omnipotent Government'' (1944) ==

The term was also popularized and explained by [[Ludwig von Mises]] in his 1944 work ''[[Omnipotent Government]]''. '''Statolatry''' is literally worship of the State analogous to ''[[idolatry]]'' as worship of idols. It asserts that the glorification and aggrandizement of 'State' or 'Nation' is the object of all legitimate human aspiration at the expense of all else, including personal welfare and independent thought. Expansion of the power and influence of one's State is to be achieved, if necessary, through aggressive [[war]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] adventures (i.e. [[imperialism]]). It far exceeds the [[patriotism]] of those who recognize the rights of people other than themselves to [[self-determination]], and might best be described as super-patriotism or [[chauvinism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17147">'''Taxation of the Jews in Europe''' refers to taxes imposed specifically on [[Jewish]] people in [[Europe]], in addition to the taxes levied on the general population.  Special taxation imposed on the Jews by the state or ruler of the territory in which they were living has played an important part in Jewish history.&lt;ref name="Judaica"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ancienttaxation.html Taxation. Encyclopaedia Judaica.] Reproduced by Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of special taxes on the Jews followed their admission to civil rights in France and elsewhere in Europe at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Judaica"/&gt;

== In the Roman Empire ==
The [[Fiscus Judaicus]] ([[Latin]]: "Jewish tax") or "Temple Tax" was a [[tax]] collecting agency instituted to collect the tax imposed on [[Jewish diaspora#Post-Roman Diaspora|Jews]] in the [[Roman Empire]] after the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE in favor of the temple of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter Capitolinus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 CE.  Vespasian imposed the tax in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 65.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

== In the Holy Roman Empire ==
The Jewish populations of Europe were politically insecure and could be easily exploited for the levying of heavy taxes in exchange for official protection. The high interest rates charged by Jews became an illimitable source of tax revenue and Jewish wealth was technically easy to gauge because Jews typically stored their assets in the form of cash or promissory notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Imperial Tax Register of 1241 was the first register to include taxes on the Jews. The total of the taxes on the Jews listed in the Register amounted to 857 silver marks; the total contribution of all the cities together amounted to 4.290 silver marks. These local taxes served wholly or in part to finance town-building. Not all of the contributions reached the central administration. In contrast, it is clear from the Register that the payments made by the Jews reached the Exchequer in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 13&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes on the Jews were first described as the ’’Jewish Tax’’ in 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opferfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. This taxation was 1 florin for every Jew and included assets worth more than 20 florins. Widows were not exempted. King Wenceslas removed the taxable minimum but an exemption for Jews dependent on alms was made later by Sigsmund, who himself levied heavy taxation. Sigsmund taxed a third of the value of Jewish properties. It was represented as a coronation tax as part of Sigsmund's attempts to ascend the throne.  Isenmann disagrees and believes it was an innovation sprouted by Archchamberlain Konrad von Weinsberg. By 1433-4 the tax collectors were collecting tax worth a half of Jewish properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Triers]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG.

== Leibzoll ==

The ''[[Leibzoll]]'' or ''Judengeleit'' was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler | title=The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA669| year=1906| publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Hungary ==
[[Tolerance tax]] (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], beginning in 1747.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Poland ==

=== Koło ===
In 1571 a contract was drafted with regard to the status of the Jews in [[Koło]], in which the city's Christians have undertaken to provide protection to the Jews, in return for which the Jews were required to pay a special annual municipal tax.&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;Mahler, Rafael. [http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/kolo/kol008.html "From the near and far past".  Some information about the history of the Jews of Koło.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729 the Jewish community was required to pay 150 gold coins as an annual poll tax, and in 1738 this sum was increased to 300 gold coins.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

In 1775 the Polish parliament imposed a special duty on books written in [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], requiring each book to be stamped by the municipality. Despite heavy penalties imposed on owners of unstamped books, many books were concealed and unstamped.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

== In Russia ==
The Russian [[Kosher tax]], known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==In Galicia==
Between 1777 and 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the southeast corner of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], paid a number of special taxes, including the "protection and [[tolerance tax]]", and the "property and occupation tax". In 1784, the property and occupation tax was replaced with the kosher meat tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Moldavia==
In 1741, Moldavian prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the crupca, an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=925 Iaşi, by Lucian-Zeev Herşcovici ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Altona and Hamburg ==
During the period 1641&amp;ndash;1842, the [[Jews]] of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (then a town close to Hamburg) paid specifically Jewish taxes as well as the same taxes as other residents of Altona. The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents.

In 1640 the Danish King [[Christian IV]] acquired part of the [[Holstein-Pinneberg|County of Pinneberg]] including Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Altona was subsequently granted the rights and status of a town on 23 August 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Hamburg ===

The community was founded principally by Portuguese merchants and was known as the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Portuguese-Jewish Community]], although many of its members were of Spanish-Jewish descent. 

These [[Sephardic Jews]], who initially pretended to be persecuted [[Catholic]]s, first came to [[Hamburg]] at the end of the 16th century. They were mostly Portuguese- or Spanish-speaking merchants. In 1621, when the armistice between [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]] came to an end, many of the Portuguese Jews moved to Hamburg. They were made welcome, even after the actual situation had become clear; however they were not permitted to establish a cemetery within the city walls. Thanks to the linguistic skills of the Sephardim and their contacts among their co-religionaries they controlled a large sector of the German market in provisions. The Sephardim differed culturally and socially from the Jews who came to Altona, and subsequently also to Hamburg, from the east. These were [[Yiddish Language]] speaking [[Ashkenazim]].
The permanent settlement of the Ashkenazim was opposed by both the [[Senate of Hamburg]] (town council) and the citizens, supported by the Sephardim, who did not wish to see the establishment of a second community in Hamburg. As servants, referred to as tudescos, the Ashkenazi Jews were, de facto, under the protection of the Sephardic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 91&amp;ndash;94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Altona ===

On 1 August 1641 the Danish king had formally granted the Ashkenazi Jews the privilege of having in Altona, as hitherto, a cemetery and a synagogue, thus providing the basis for the existence of a Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the Danish kings promised the Jews personal security, the freedom to practice trade and religious liberties. Some of the Jews living in Hamburg therefore tried  to secure the legal protection of the Danish crown in case of any attempt to expel them. In Altona the conditions of residence were favorable, in Hamburg the conditions for trading. These were the reasons for the genesis of the Altona community of Ashkenazi Jews from Hamburg and Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to immigration from the east, Altona became a center of research and scholarship in Jewish teaching, attracting hundreds of students. The officially recognized [[Beth din|Jewish court of justice]] had a reputation as one of the most distinguished in the whole Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 243&amp;ndash;244&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews did not acquire these privileges freely, but in return for the payment of taxes.

=== Levies on Jews ===

From 1584 to 1639, as in the Middle Ages, the Jews of Altona paid taxes specific to the Jews, but no further taxes. Each Jewish family was required to pay 6 [[rixdollar|Reichstaler]] per year. Under Danish rule this changed: the Jews continued to pay the specifically Jewish taxes plus the same taxes as all other residents.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; From 1641 every Jewish family was required to pay 5 Reichstaler in Jewish taxes; in the year when Altona became a town the contribution rose to 6 Reichstaler.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135, pp. 180&amp;ndash;181&lt;/ref&gt; With the ordinance of 1641 the Danish king had permitted the Jews [[shechita]]. This privilege too was not cost-free. For the years 1667&amp;ndash;1669 we have records of taxes paid by Jewish butchers. According to these the rates were 1 Mark and 8 Schillinge for an ox, 4 Schillinge for a calf and 2 Schillinge for a lamb. These taxes were twice as high as those paid by Christian butchers.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 153, pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; From 1681 Individual taxes on the Jews (6 Reichstaler plus the payments made by the Jewish butchers), were replaced by lump-sum payments by the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the year 1712 onwards it is possible to calculate the amount of the lump-sum payments made by the Jews. During the period 1712&amp;ndash;1818 this amounted to 6 Reichstaler for each Jewish family; 6 Reichstaler was the level that had already been set in 1584. Assuming that a Jewish family consisted of approximately 6 persons, 6 Reichstaler corresponded to 1 Reichstaler for each individual Jew. On top of this 1 Reichstaler, also paid by the other residents, had to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 265-266. Meaningful conversion of the face-value can be made for this period since, unlike the paper money of Copenhagen, the silver currency of Altona was stable, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents. The influence of this on business practice constituted an obstacle to the granting of civil rights. In the year 1818 the Jewish Elders declared to the community of Altona that they could not, ’’on the one hand, levy specifically Jewish taxes on the members of their community and, on the other hand, encourage our co-religionaries, especially the younger ones, to pursue useful activity. In short: so to improve our condition that we might not seem unworthy to acquire civil rights. The extension – against our wishes - of the taxes on the Jews would be incompatible with the granting of civil rights.’’&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the struggle of the Jewish community for emancipation. The Jewish community secured the abolition of taxes on the Jews in the year 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chinese State in Ming Society''''' is a history book which investigates the role of the [[Government|state]] in China in the [[Ming dynasty]] (from 1368 to 1644 in the [[Late Imperial China|late Imperial Chinese era]]); the interface between the state and [[society]], and the effect of the state on ordinary people.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"&gt;{{cite journal

==Synopsis==
''The Chinese State in Ming Society '' is set in the Ming dynasty, an era in which there was much "[[Commerce|commercial]] expansion and [[Culture|cultural]] [[innovation]]".&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt; The book is an "account of events and issues that engaged the members of local [[elite]]s in [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] society and of the interface between these elites and the state,"&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; and the impact of the state on ordinary people in areas such as [[education]], [[Judiciary|justice]], the [[military]] and [[taxation]].&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

The book consists of a reworking of eight "heavily illustrated" essays which Brook has written and published separately over the years, and is divided into four main sections (parts I to IV) with two of these essays to each part of the book.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt; The parts are named "Space", "Fields", "Books" and "[[Monastery|Monasteries]]", each of which "represent important areas of intersection between the Ming state and society."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoutledgeBlurb"/&gt;

Brook argues that the model of [[despotism|despotic government]] fails to account for the complex interactions between individuals, groups, communities, society and state in this period.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; Instead he proposes that by 1500 the Chinese had a remarkably developed system of [[Government|governance]], surpassing that of the European [[Monarchy|monarchs]] of the time, and that the developments were not the result of the isolated actions of the state, but rather of a complex interface and interaction, including local representatives of the state such as [[magistrate]]s and local networks of the elite [[Social class|class]] of [[gentry]].&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; According to Ellen Soulliere in her review, Brook argues that "society had the [enduring] ability to constrain, limit and sometimes redirect the [[authority]] of the state, without challenging its most basic claim to be the source of all legitimate authority."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Writing in the ''[[New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies]]'', Ellen Soulliere describes the book as a "detailed", "succinct" and "compelling" account.&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt; In conclusion, she states that "All in all, this is a fascinating and very valuable book that addresses major themes in [[History of China|Chinese history]] while greatly expanding our detailed knowledge of the issues that engaged people at the level of their local communities. It illuminates the [[Group conflict|conflicts]] and [[Controversy|controversies]] that kept the state and society in a state of dynamic tension throughout the Ming period and beyond."&lt;ref name="NewZealandJournalOfAsianStudies"/&gt;

'''Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|PC|FRS}} (23 July 1666 &amp;ndash; 28 April 1732) was an [[England|English]] [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] politician.

==Youth and early career==
He was born in [[Staffordshire]], the son of Thomas Parker, an attorney at [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. He was educated at [[Adams' Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PRKR685T|name=Parker, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Janet Carrier, whose sister was married to William Anson, [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|1st Baron Anson]]'s father. He was called to the bar in 1691, and became a [[Member of Parliament]] and was [[knight]]ed in 1705. In 1710 he refused the office of [[Lord Chancellor]], but was made a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Counsellor]]. He was [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] from 1710 to 1718 and was involved in the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell|Dr Sacheverell]]. He made a vehement attack on Sacheverell and the high church clergy.&lt;ref name=aim25&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/frames/fulldesc?inst_id=13&amp;coll_id=3645&amp;full=1&amp;template=1]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a friend of [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]], whose satirical ''Fable of the Bees'' became highly controversial in the 1720s.

He became a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1713. He also had a grammar school built at [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], his home town. In 1714 he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Parker of Macclesfield'''.

On 1 August 1714, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] died, and her successor, [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], was in [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], so Baron Parker was designated Regent of Great Britain, Ireland and the realms beyond the seas until the new monarch could be informed of the situation and take the crown. He governed until 18 September 1714. 

In 1718, because the King could not speak English, Parker gave the [[speech from the throne|King's Speech]] in the [[House of Lords]].

==Lord Chancellor==
In 1718, he became Lord Chancellor and given a pension for life, and was a favourite of the [[George I of Great Britain|King]]. In 1721, he was advanced to the title '''Earl of Macclesfield''' with the additional subsidiary title of '''Viscount Parker'''. In 1724, he was implicated in financial irregularities, but he did not resign as [[Lord Chancellor]] until 1725.

==Impeachment==
In 1725, he was [[impeachment|impeached]] and tried in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt; He was, unanimously, convicted of corruption for taking more than £100,000 in bribes (the equivalent of more than £11,000,000 today). He was fined £30,000 and placed in the [[Tower of London]] until payment was received. He was also struck off the roll of the [[Privy Council]]. He was a fabulously wealthy man, possibly because of his corruption, but as this money was confiscated, he had no resources to pay his fine. He spent most of the rest of his life at [[Shirburn Castle]], where he was buried.

He was, however, still able to be a pallbearer at the funeral of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in 1727. He died in [[Soho Square]], London.

'''Trans-Love Energies''' is a [[medical marijuana]] compassion center in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

==History==
The organization began in Detroit during the early 1960s as a communal living environment, but later relocated to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Love Energies that was a nucleus of artists who believed in common goals that if the people work together those goals can be reached

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder was poet and political activist, [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]. The commune consisted of two houses located side-by-side. Each house was home to a musical band, and to free-thinkers of the time, including members of the [[White Panther]] movement, the ''[[Ann Arbor Argus]]'' newspaper, and the [[MC5]]. The address of their 1486 Gratiot Ave. office is often considered the birthplace of Detroit techno as it housed Kevin Saunderson's KMS Recording in 1982.

==Current role==
The organization has narrowed its scope from the social activism of the 1960s to assisting persons who wish to use marijuana to cope with medical ailments.

{{basic forms of government}}
'''World government''' or '''global government''' is the notion of a common [[political]] authority for all of humanity, yielding a global [[government]] and a single [[state (polity)|state]] that exercises [[authority]] over the entire [[Earth]]. Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [[world domination]] or through peaceful and voluntary [[supranational union]].

There has never been a worldwide [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], [[military]], or [[constitution]] with global jurisdiction. The [[United Nations]], beyond the [[United Nations Security Council]] (which has the ability to issue mandatory resolutions), is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster co-operation between existing [[nation|national]] governments rather than exert authority over them.

==History==

===Origins of the idea===
The idea and aspiration of world government has been known since the dawn of history. Bronze Age Egyptian Kings aimed to rule "All That the Sun Encircles", Mesopotamian Kings "All from the Sunrise to the Sunset", and ancient Chinese and Japanese Emperors "All under Heaven". These four civilizations developed impressive cultures of [[Great Unity]], or Da Yitong as the Chinese put it. In 113 BC, the Han Dynasty in China erected an Altar of the Great Unity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] II:38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] said that the Roman achievement of imposing one Government over the Mediterranean world was a "marvelous" achievement, and that the main task of future historians will be to explain how this was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | title=The Histories of Polybius | volume=1 | author=[[Polybius]] | translator=Evelyn S. Shuckburg from the text of F. Hultsch | year=1889 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | publisher=Macmillan and Co | location=London and New York | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328103700/http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | archive-date=2016-03-28 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dante===
The idea of world government outlived the fall of the [[Pax Romana]] for a millennium. [[Dante]] in the fourteenth century despairingly appealed to the human race: "But what has been the condition of the world since that day the seamless robe [of Pax Romana] first suffered mutilation by the claws of avarice, we can read—would that we could not also see! O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, and sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"" (''[[De Monarchia]]'', 16:1)

===Francisco de Vitoria===
{{Main|Francisco de Vitoria}}

Early father of international law, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (c. 1483–1546) is considered the "founder of global political philosophy". De Vitoria conceived of the ''res publica totius orbis'', or the "republic of the whole world". This came at a time when the [[University of Salamanca]] was engaged in unprecedented thought concerning [[human rights]], [[international law]], and early economics based on the experiences of the [[Spanish Empire]].

===Hugo Grotius===
{{Main|Hugo Grotius}}
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|150px|Title page of the 1631 second edition of ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'']]

''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace'') is a 1625 book in Latin, written by [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645) and published in Paris, on the legal status of war. It is now regarded as a foundational work in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html USYD.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220195422/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius was a philosopher, theologian, playwright, and poet. He is known for coming up with the idea of having an international law, and is still acknowledged today by the American Society of International Law.

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Writing in 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] considered World Citizenship to be a necessary step in establishing world peace]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote the essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]] ([[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf.]]) (1795)". In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of [[Perpetual peace|lasting peace]] throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.

The "Preliminary Articles" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:

# "No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War"
# "No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation"
# "[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished"
# "National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States"
# "No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,
# "No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State"

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.

# "The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican"
# "The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States"
# "The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality"

===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===
The year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''Characteristics of the Present Age'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:

{{quote|
There is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally... Such is the case in Ancient History ... As the States become stronger in themselves and cast off that [Papal] foreign power, the tendency towards a Universal Monarchy over the whole Christian World necessarily comes to light... This tendency ... has shown itself successively in several States which could make pretensions to such a dominion, and since the fall of the Papacy, it has become the sole animating principle of our History... Whether clearly or not—it may be obscurely—yet has this tendency lain at the root of the undertakings of many States in Modern Times... Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward.&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, (1806). "Characteristics of the Present Age," ''Theory and Practice of the Balance of Power, 1486–1914: Selected European Writings'', (ed. Moorhead Wright, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1975, pp. 87–89).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Joseph Smith===
{{Main|World Government (Mormonism)}}
{{See also|Theodemocracy}}

In early 19th century [[Mormon]] theology, [[Joseph Smith]] taught that a [[theodemocracy]] would guide and direct the [[Kingdom of God]] ([[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]) on the earth during the [[end time]]s. On March 11, 1844, Smith organized a [[Council of Fifty]], who were to work under the direction of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities of his church, along with a [[Council of Friends]]. This group of three organizations was expected to rule as a world government just prior to the [[Millennialism|Millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrus |first= Hyrum Leslie |date= 1958 |title= Joseph Smith and World Government |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |oclc= 4146522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BYUR1.1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |contribution= Joseph Smith and World Government |title= Book Reviews |first= Robert E. |last= Riggs |pages= 71–73 |journal= [[BYU Studies]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date= Winter 1959 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107125015/http://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |archivedate= 2011-11-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |title= The Grand Fundamental Principles of Mormonism: Joseph Smith's Unfinished Reformation |first= Don |last= Bradley |date= April 2006 |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |pages= 32–41 |access-date= 2012-02-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140634/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |archive-date= 2012-09-04 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alfred, Lord Tennyson===
In 1842, the English poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], published the oft-quoted lines "[[Locksley Hall]]": ''For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see / Saw a Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be /... / Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer / and the battle-flags were furled / In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. / There the common sense of most shall hold / a fretful realm in awe / And the kindly earth shall slumber / lapt in universal law''.

===Ulysses S. Grant===
President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was convinced in 1873: "Transport, education and rapid development of both spiritual and material relationships by means of steam power and the telegraph, all this will make great changes. I am convinced that the Great Framer of the World will so develop it that it becomes one nation, so that armies and navies are no longer necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Clarence Streit]], [[Union Now|Union Now: The Proposal for Inter-Democracy Federal Union]], (London &amp; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1940), p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also commented, "I believe at some future day, the nations of the earth will agree on some sort of congress which will take cognizance of international questions of difficulty and whose decisions will be as binding as the decisions of the Supreme Court are upon us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartzberg |first= Joseph E. |authorlink= Joseph E.

===William Gladstone===
The first thinker to anticipate a kind of world unity ("great household of the world") under the American primacy seems to be British politician [[William Gladstone]]. In 1878, he wrote:

{{quote|
While we have been advancing with portentous rapidity, America is passing us by as if a canter. There can hardly be a doubt, as between America and England, of the belief that the daughter at no very distant time will ... be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother ... She [America] will probably become what we are now—head servant in the great household of the world...&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Hans Kohn]], "The US and Western Europe: A New Era of Understanding," ''Orbis'', 6/1,  (1962): p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kang Youwei===
In 1885, [[Kang Youwei]] published his ''One World Philosophy'', where he based his vision on the evidence of political expansion which began in the immemorial past and went in his days on.&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 85).&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes:

{{quote|Finally, the present Powers of the world were formed.  This process [of coalescing and forming fewer, larger units] has all taken place among the 10,000 countries over several thousand years. The progression from dispersion to union among men, and the principle [whereby] the world is [gradually] proceeding from being partitioned off to being opened up, is a spontaneous [working] of the Way of Heaven (or Nature) and human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No factor, he believed, in the long run could resist the "laws of empires".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kang Youwei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, pp. 79–80, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; Kang Youwei projects the culmination of the ongoing world unification with the final confrontation between the United States and Germany: "Some day America will take in [all the states of] the American continent and Germany will take in all the [states of] Europe.  This will hasten the world along the road to One World."&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"/&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (1886) envisaged: 
{{quote|
I should rather prefer such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening—namely to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the domination of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Vacher de Lapouge===
The French demographer, George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], followed K'ang Yu-wei in 1899 with his ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social''. Similarly, he outlined the logistic growth of empires from the Bronze Age till his days, when "six states govern... three quarters of the globe", and concluded: "The moment is close when the struggle for the domination of the world is going to take place."&lt;ref&gt;George Vacher de Lapouge, ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," p. XXXI).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacher de Lapouge did not bet on Washington and Berlin in the final contest for world domination contrary to K'ang Yu-wei. Like his earlier compatriot, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], he guessed the Cold War contenders correctly but he went one step further. He estimated the chances of the United States as favorite in the final confrontation:

{{quote|The reign of Europe is over, well over... The future of France seems less certain but it is unnecessary to become illusioned... I do not believe by the way that Germany might count for a much longer future... We could... envisage... the possibility that England and her immense Empire comes to surrender to the United States. The latter... is the true adversary of Russia in the great struggle to come... I also believe that the United States is appealed to triumph. Otherwise, the universe would be Russian.&lt;ref&gt;George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," pp. XXXI–XXXII).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bahá'u'lláh===
In the second half of the 19th century, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] founded the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a religion which identified the establishment of world unity and a global federation of nations as a key principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Bahá'í International Community | date = 1995 | title = Turning Point for All Nations | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | access-date = 2013-03-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130406044732/http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | archive-date = 2013-04-06 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He envisioned a [[Bahá'í administration|set of new social structures]] based on participation and consultation among the world's peoples, including a world legislature, an international court, and an international executive empowered to carry out the decisions of these legislative and judicial bodies.

In ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]],'' first published in 1938, [[Shoghi Effendi]], great-grandson of Bahá'u'lláh and the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Bahá'í Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957, described the anticipated world government of that religion as the "world's future super-state" with the Bahá'í Faith as the "State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=7 |chapter=Local and National Houses of Justice |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-3.html#pg7 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shoghi Effendi, "The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá'u'lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=203 |chapter=World Unity the Goal |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-56.html#pg203 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his many scriptures and messages addressed to the most prominent state leaders of his time, Bahá'u'lláh called for world reconciliation, reunification, [[collective security]] and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Many of the most fundamental [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] address the central issue of world unity, such as the following: "The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author=Bahá'u'lláh  |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh  |date=1976  |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh  |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust  |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA  |isbn=0-87743-187-6  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |access-date=2013-03-29  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403063729/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |archive-date=2013-04-03  |dead-url=no  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|title=Global statistics for all religions: 2001 AD|author=|date=|website=www.bible.ca|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xz7V0tX7?url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|archive-date=2011-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Peace Congress===
{{Main|International Peace Congress}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}

Starting in 1843, [[International Peace Congress]]es were held in [[Europe]] every two years, but lost their momentum after 1853 due to the renewed outbreak of wars in Europe ([[Crimea]]) and North America ([[American Civil War]]).

===International organizations===
{{Main|International organizations}}
[[File:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|thumb|150px|Emblem of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] ]]

International organizations started forming in the late 19th century – the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in 1863, the [[Telegraphic Union]] in 1865 and the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1874. The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published "The Institutes of the Law of Nations" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed "an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions".

===H. G. Wells===
In ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1900), [[H. G. Wells]] envisaged that "the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic" will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, "a New Republic dominating the world", will by the year 2000 become the means "by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever". It will be "a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle". Such a synthesis "of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', pp 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Republic "will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes..." Its principles and opinions "must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase". The New Republic must ultimately become a "World-State".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===League of Nations===
{{Main|League of Nations}}
{{See also|Fourteen Points}}

The [[League of Nations]] (LoN) was an inter-governmental organization founded as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919–1920. At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.

===World Communism===
According to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.

Although [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.

The heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917–23]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].

===Halford Mackinder===
Anticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:
{{quote| 
Gradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater. It may perhaps be thought that with the continuance of this process all mankind will be in the end unified … Unless I mistake, it is the message of geography that international cooperation in any future that we need consider must be based on the federal idea. If our civilization is not to go down in blind internecine conflict, there must be a development of world planning out of regional planning, just as regional planning has come from town planning.&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Habitat," ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'', 47, (1931): p 333, also 335.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nazi Germany===
{{Further|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum}}

The ruling [[Nazi Party]] of 1933–1945 [[Germany]] envisaged the ultimate establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard L. (1995) ''Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in modern German and world history''. [[Cambridge University Press]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=9OfrTvu7CNYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=hitler+world+peace+can+be+obtained+only&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=VqgYTcyqGYihOprn7LsJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20peace&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt; In its move to overthrow the post-[[World War I]] [[Treaty of Versailles]] Germany had already withdrawn itself from the [[League of Nations]], and it did not intend to join a similar [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] organization ever again.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1995, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In his desire and stated political aim of expanding the living space (''Lebensraum'') of the German people by destroying or driving out "lesser-deserving races" in and from other territories dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] may have devised an ideological system of self-perpetuating [[expansionism]], in which the expansion of a state's population would require the conquest of more territory which would, in turn, lead to a further growth in population which would then require even more conquests.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt; In 1927, [[Rudolf Hess]] relayed to [[Walter Hewel]] Hitler's belief that [[world peace]] could only be acquired "when one power, the [[Racial supremacism|racially best one]], has attained uncontested supremacy". When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself "the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly".&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt;

===Imperial Japan===
During its imperial period (1868–1945), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, "''[[Hakkō ichiu]]''", translated as "eight corners of the world under one roof". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Greater Asian Coprosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.

===Atlantic Charter===
{{Main|Atlantic Charter}}
[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]

The [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.

===Harry Truman===
U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: "We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

===World Federalist Movement===

{{Main|World Federalist Movement}}
{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}

The years between the conclusion of World War II and 1950, when the [[Korean War]] started and the [[Cold War]] mindset became dominant in international politics, were the "golden age" of the world federalist movement. [[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the "bible" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.

Similar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.

===United Nations===
{{Main|United Nations}}
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]

[[World War II]] (1939–1945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.

===Proposed United Nations Parliamentary Assembly===
{{Main|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly}}
[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]

A [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.&lt;ref name="CrossPartyCoalition"&gt;Watson, Graham (26 September 2007).

Davis [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his American citizenship]] and started a [[Registry of World Citizens]]. On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of [[Ellsworth, Maine]] the formation of the "World Government of World Citizens" based on 3 "World Laws"—One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |title=Worldservice.org |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043653/http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |archive-date=2010-02-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this declaration, mandated, he claimed, by Article twenty one, Section three of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government.

====World Passport====
{{main|World Passport}}
The World Passport is a 45-page document sold by the [[World Service Authority]], a non-profit organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm Romingerlegal.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206221359/http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm|date=2010-02-06}}, 99-1334 - U.S. v.

World Passports have allegedly  been accepted sporadically by some 174 countries, but no immigration authority has a de facto or de jure policy of acceptance with regards to the document. The latest edition of the World Passport, which has been on sale since January 2007, is an MRD ([[Machine-readable passport|machine readable document]]) with an alphanumeric code bar enabling computer input plus an embedded "ghost" photo for security, printing overcovered with a plastic film. The document is in 7 languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese|Simplified Chinese]] and [[Esperanto]]. Two covers are available: "World Passport", and "World Government Passport" (for registered World Citizens), ("passport" is in 7 languages on both covers). Other documents sold by the WSA include a World Birth Certificate, a World Political Asylum Card, a World Marriage Certificate, and a World Identity Card. Each page within the document is numbered and each page has the World Citizen logo in the background. There are two pages for affiliation with companies, organizations, and firms. There are nineteen visa pages in the document. On the back cover there are spaces for personal information such as a person’s home address.

===Legal Realism (1954)===
{{Main|E. Adamson Hoebel}}

Legal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331–333)&lt;/ref&gt; "Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates – postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done – and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law – then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive".

===End of the Cold War (1992)===
While enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–1992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.

Following the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.

{{As of|2018}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.

The Earth is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations.  In this way a countries cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.

Among the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:
* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.
* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;br/&gt;Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.
* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the "closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.
* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.
* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.
* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.
* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.

In addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the "[[global market]]") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws. A proactive form of globalization is emerging, spawned by international corporations that wish to loosen trade restrictions. It is the global financial firms that have been the most eager proponents of this expansion. A group of advocates from different parts of the world had been pushing for an integrated global society as envisioned in the Globalist Manifesto which is the foundation of globalism ideology.&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;Falk, Avner.

==Existing regional unions of nations==
{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}

The only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Bauböck-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship? Normative Approaches to Supranational Union|journal=[[Theoretical Inquiries in Law]]|volume=8|issue=2, Article 5|publisher=[[Berkeley Electronic Press]]|issn=1565-3404|url=http://www.bepress.com/til/default/vol8/iss2/art5|doi=10.2202/1565-3404.1157|accessdate=2009-08-01|quote=A normative theory of supranational citizenship will necessarily be informed by the EU as the only present case and will be addressed to the EU in most of its prescriptions|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127190025/http://www.bepress.com/til/default/vol8/iss2/art5/|archivedate=2010-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of other regional organizations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects.

* [[African Union]] (AU)
* [[Arab League]]
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN)
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM)
* [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA)
* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS)
* [[Commonwealth of Nations]] 
* [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (CCASG)
* [[East African Community]] (EAC)
* [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EEU)
* [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)
* [[Organization of American States]] (OAS)
* [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC)
* [[Turkic Council]] (TurkKon)
* [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR)
* [[Union State]]

Other organisations that have also discussed greater integration include:

* [[Arab League]] into an "[[Arab Union]]"
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) into a "Caribbean Federation"
* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) into a "[[North American Union]]"
* [[Pacific Islands Forum]] into a "[[Pacific Union]]"

===European Union===
[[File:Locator European Union.svg|thumb|right|150px|Map of [[European Union]] nations]]

The most relevant model{{peacock-inline|date=July 2018}} for the incremental establishment of a global federation may be the [[European Union]] (EU), which politically unites a large group of widely diverse (and some formerly hostile) nations spread over a large geographical area and encompassing over 500 million people. Although the EU is still evolving, it already has many attributes of a federal government such as open internal borders, a directly elected parliament, a court system, an official currency ([[Euro]]), and a centralized economic policy. A treaty change would be needed to allow for enlargement of the Union beyond the European continent.&lt;ref name="gissac1"&gt;Bart Gissac "Idées pour l'Union", ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'', 5 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's example is being followed by the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Organization of Central American States]], and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-eight European states.  It has developed a "single market" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without a passport.  This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading.  The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money.  Not all EU member states use the Euro; the United Kingdom, for example, retains the [[pound sterling]].  Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.  Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union.

===NATO===
[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[NATO]] nations]]

The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of [[collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in [[Brussels]], Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22&amp;nbsp;countries participate in NATO's "[[Partnership for Peace]]", with 15&amp;nbsp;other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|the world's defence spending]].&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CARICOM===
[[File:CARICOM Map 2010-2.png|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[CARICOM]] nations]]

The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), is an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.

Since the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ).

===African Union===
[[File:African Union (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|150px|right|Map of [[African Union]] nations]]

The [[African Union]] (AU) is an organisation consisting of all the 55 [[Africa]]n states of the continent and African waters. Established on July 9, 2002, the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State.{{Citation needed|date = July 2014}} The purpose of the union is to help secure Africa's [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and a [[Economy of Africa|sustainable economy]], especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.

Projects for improved economic and political cooperation are also happening at a regional level with the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[East African Community]].

The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] is comparable to a [[confederation]] similar to the original [[European Community]]. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization, possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security.  It has also promoted cooperation on [[democratization]] and cross-border [[crime prevention]]. As a regional organization, CIS participates in [[Peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/lessons/Regional%20Organizations.pdf |title= Regional organizations in UN peacekeeping activities |access-date= 2017-06-29 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090807012106/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/lessons/Regional%20Organizations.pdf |archive-date= 2009-08-07 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(354 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the CIS have established the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] with the aim of creating a full-fledged [[common market]].

It was established on December 8, 1985 by [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Maldives]] and [[Bhutan]]. In April 2007, at the Association's 14th summit, [[Afghanistan]] became its eighth member.

===Organisation of Islamic Cooperation===
[[Image:OIC map.png|thumb|left|Map of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members (green) and observers (red)]]

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organisation]] with a permanent delegation to the [[United Nations]]. It groups 57 member states, from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. The organization claims it represents the Global Islamic World (''[[ummah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|title="The Organization has the singular honor to galvanize the Ummah into a unified body and have actively represented the Muslims by espousing all causes close to the hearts of over 1.5 billion Muslims of the world."|author=|date=|website=oic-oci.org|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926165053/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|archive-date=2015-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of the organisation are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Since the 19th century, many [[Muslims]] have aspired to uniting the Muslim ''ummah'' to serve their common political, economic and social interests. Despite the presence of secularist, nationalist and socialist ideologies in modern Muslim states, they have cooperated to form the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The formation of the OIC happened in the backdrop of the loss of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The final cause sufficiently compelled leaders of Muslim nations to meet in Rabat to establish the OIC on September 25, 1969.&lt;ref name=EIMW&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |title={title} |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314053224/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |archive-date=2010-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=January 2013}}

According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name=EIMW/&gt;

On August 5, 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.&lt;ref name=CDHRII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam|date=August 5, 1990|access-date=2010-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093031/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|archive-date=2010-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkic Council===

The [[Turkic Council]] is an international organization comprising Turkic countries. Since 1992, the ''Turkic Language Speaking Countries Summit'' has been organizing amongst the Turkic countries. On October 3, 2009, four of these countries signed the Nahcivan Agreement. The organizational center is [[İstanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.
