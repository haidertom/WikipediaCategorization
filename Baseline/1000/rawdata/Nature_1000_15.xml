[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood–it's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency—Bulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">The '''Aharonov–Casher effect''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon predicted in 1984 in which a traveling [[magnetic dipole]] is affected by an [[electric field]]. It is [[Duality (electricity and magnetism)|dual]] to the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], in which the quantum phase of a charged particle depends upon which side of a magnetic flux tube it comes through. In the Aharonov–Casher effect, the particle has a magnetic moment and the tubes are charged instead.  It was observed in a gravitational neutron inferometer in 1989(Cimmino et al.) and later by fluxon interference of magnetic vortices in Josephson junctions (Elion et al.).  It has also been seen with electrons and atoms.

In both effects the particle acquires a phase shift (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) while traveling along some path ''P''. In the Aharonov–Bohm effect it is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{AB} = \frac{q}{\hbar} \int_P \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

While for the Aharonov–Casher effect it is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{AC} = \frac{1}{\hbar c^2} \int_P (\mathbf{E}\times \boldsymbol \mu) \cdot d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is its charge and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic moment.  The effects have been observed together(Bogachek and [[Uzi Landman|Landman]]).

The '''amity-enmity complex''' was a term introduced by [[Sir Arthur Keith]]. His work, ''[[A New Theory of Human Evolution]]'' (1948), posited that humans evolved as differing races, tribes, and cultures, exhibiting patriotism, morality, leadership and nationalism. Those who belong are part of the [[in-group]], and tolerated; all others are classed as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]], and subject to hostility; 'The code of enmity is a necessary part of the machinery of evolution. He who feels generous towards his enemy... has given up his place in the turmoil of evolutionary competition.' [[Conscience]] in humans evolved a duality; to protect and save friends,
and also to hate and fight enemies. &lt;ref&gt; Sir Arthur Keith, A new theory of evolution, Watts and Co, 1948, p 82 &lt;/ref&gt;
Keith's work summarized earlier opinions on human [[tribalism]] by [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwin, [[Descent of Man]], 1879, chapter 7, On the Races of man &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwinism, Wallace, 1889, chapter 15 &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Spencer]].

==Case studies==
{{Unsourced section|date=November 2017}}
# United States; [[racial segregation]]: Keith suggested that racial segregation imposed by [[Jim Crow law]]s was a 'vast experiment' in which ten million coloureds were 'marked off (in 1948) from the rest by a frontier as sharply defined and jealously guarded as the frontiers of a kingdom'.
# [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]: White 'dominance' was 'deeply seated in the primitive organization of the Human brain. [[Boer]] and British settlers both agree 'there is an impassable frontier between them and the native races of Africa and Asia'.
# Jews in Europe: 'The Jews maintain a racial frontier (in 1948), such as dominant races surround themselves with; they carry themselves as if racially distinct...the Jewish frontier may be strengthened by the faith which is (sic) the standard of the race.'  Keith alleged that Jews had a 'dual code; conduct towards their fellows is based on amity, that to all outside their circle is based on enmity. The use of the dual code is the mark of an evolving race.'
# The Indian [[caste system]].

==Disruption==
The amity-enmity complex maintains 'tribal spirit' and thus unity, of the community, 'as long as personal contact between its members is possible.' If the community grows beyond this limitation, then disruption, swarming and disintegration occur. Modern mass communication enables communities 'of 100 million' to remain intact.

==Cyclical effect==
Keith expressed regret that this phenomenon, which explains so much, had not become common knowledge:  "[W]e eternally experience the misery... of each new manifestation of the complex, then invent some new 'ism' to categorise this behavior as an evil, dealing with a common behavioural trait piecemeal [instead of] finally grasping and understanding the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

== Modern examples of tribal instinct==
Colleges, sports teams, churches, trades unions, female fashions and political parties enable people to exhibit tribal loyalty within large, mass-communicating nations. 'In politics we have to take sides.' But all these 'petty manifestations' are cast aside in time of war.
[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Lloyd George]] are cited as statesmen who knew how to exploit the tribal spirit for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/3/6/31369/|title=Index of /files/31369|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

==In later works==
[[Robert Ardrey]] pointed out that similar behavior can be observed in most primates, especially baboons and chimps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, pp. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt; "Nationalism as such is no more than a human expression of the animal drive to maintain and defend a territory... the mentality of the single Germanic tribe under Hitler differed in no way from that of early man or late baboon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amity-enmity complex is a serious obstacle to [[world peace]] and [[world government]], and may even lead to [[nuclear holocaust]]:  "How can we get along without war?... if we fail to get along without war, the future will be as lacking in human problems as it will be remarkably lacking in men."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chapter one: Tribes and Supertribes; chapter four: Ingroups and Outgroups &lt;/ref&gt; makes a prescriptive point:  "We must try to step outside our groups and look down on human battlefields with the unbiased eye of a hovering Martian."  And he warns that "the truly violent species all appear to have exterminated themselves, a lesson we should not overlook."  The inherited aggression of the amity-enmity rivalry between communities is rationalized under a "persistent cloak of ideology... a matter of ideals, moral principles, social philosophies or religious beliefs....  [O]nly an immense amount of intellectual restraint will save the situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chap. four.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War Two]], a debate about the place of instinct and learning (the [[nature versus nurture|nature-versus-nurture]] debate) has occurred. According to [[Steven Pinker]], the "bitter lessons of lynchings, world wars, and the Holocaust" have caused "prevailing theories of mind" to be "refashioned to make racism and sexism as untenable as possible. The doctrine of the [[blank slate]] became entrenched in intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker makes the point that "conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition."  Man is a product of nature, as much as malarial mosquitoes; both "are doing exactly what evolution designed them to do, even if the outcome makes people suffer...  [We] cannot call their behavior pathological...  [T]he belief that violence is an aberration is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 313-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students’ Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the ‘Balance of Nature’|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an “Anti-Balance of Nature” Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
'''Biological naturalism''' is a theory about, among other things, the relationship between [[consciousness]] and [[Human body|body]] (i.e. [[Human brain|brain]]), and hence an approach to the [[mind–body problem]]. It was first proposed by the philosopher [[John Searle]] in 1980 and is defined by two main theses: 1) all [[mental event|mental phenomena]] from [[Pain and nociception|pains]], tickles, and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower-level [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes in the brain; and 2) mental phenomena are higher-level features of the brain.

This [[logical consequence|entails]] that the brain has the right [[causality|causal]] powers to produce [[intentionality]]. However, Searle's biological naturalism does not entail that brains and ''only'' brains can cause consciousness. Searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states, our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness. In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious. The brain is a [[biological machine]], and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it artificially." (Biological Naturalism, 2004)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Searle (2).jpg|thumb|John Searle]]
Searle denies [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], the idea that the mind is a separate kind of substance to the body, as this contradicts our entire understanding of [[physics]], and unlike [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he does not bring [[God]] into the problem. Indeed, Searle denies any kind of dualism, the traditional alternative to monism, claiming the distinction is a mistake. He rejects the idea that because the mind is not objectively viewable, it does not fall under the rubric of physics.

Searle believes that consciousness "is a real part of the [[reality|real world]] and it cannot be [[Eliminative materialism|eliminated]] in favor of, or reduced to, something else"&lt;ref&gt; ''John R. Searle: Thinking about the Real World'' by Dirk Franken, Attila Karakus, and Jan G. Michel [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24715-john-r-searle-thinking-about-the-real-world/]&lt;/ref&gt; whether that something else is a neurological state of the brain or a [[computer program]]. He contends, for example, that the software known as [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] ''knows'' nothing about [[chess]]. He also believes that consciousness is both a cause of events in the body and a response to events in the body.

On the other hand, Searle doesn't treat consciousness as a [[ghost in the machine]]. He treats it, rather, as a state of the brain. The causal interaction of mind and brain can be described thus in naturalistic terms: Events at the micro-level (perhaps at that of individual [[neurons]]) cause consciousness. Changes at the macro-level (the whole brain) constitute consciousness. Micro-changes cause and then are impacted by holistic changes, in much the same way that individual football players cause a team (as a whole) to win games, causing the individuals to gain confidence from the knowledge that they are part of a winning team.

He articulates this distinction by pointing out that the common philosophical term 'reducible' is ambiguous.  Searle contends that consciousness is "causally reducible" to brain processes without being "ontologically reducible".  He hopes that making this distinction will allow him to escape the traditional dilemma between [[reductive materialism]] and substance dualism; he affirms the essentially physical nature of the universe by asserting that consciousness is completely caused by and realized in the brain, but also doesn't deny what he takes to be the obvious facts that humans really are conscious, and that conscious states have an essentially first-person nature.

It can be tempting to see the theory as a kind of [[property dualism]], since, in Searle's view, a person's mental properties are categorically different from his or her micro-physical properties. The latter have "third-person [[ontology]]" whereas the former have "first-person ontology." Micro-structure is accessible objectively by any number of people, as when several brain surgeons inspect a patient's [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. But pain or desire or [[belief]] are accessible subjectively by the person who has the pain or desire or belief, and no one else has that mode of access. However, Searle holds mental properties to be a species of physical property—ones with first-person ontology. So this sets his view apart from a dualism of physical and non-physical properties. His mental properties are putatively physical.

==Criticism==
There have been several criticisms of Searle's idea of biological naturalism.

[[Jerry Fodor]] suggests that Searle gives us no account at all of exactly ''why'' he believes that  a biochemistry like, or similar to, that of the human brain is indispensable for [[intentionality]]. Fodor thinks that it seems much more plausible to suppose that it is the way in which an organism (or any other system for that matter) is connected to its environment that is indispensable in the explanation of intentionality. It is easier to see "how the fact that my thought is causally connected to a tree might bear on its being a thought about a tree. But it's hard to imagine how the fact that (to put it crudely) my thought is made out of hydrocarbons could matter, except on the unlikely hypothesis that only hydrocarbons can be causally connected to trees in the way that brains are." &lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry. (1980) "Searle On What Only Brains Can Do". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;217–219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Haugeland]] takes on the central notion of some set of special "right causal powers" that Searle attributes to the biochemistry of the human brain. He asks us to imagine a concrete situation in which the "right" causal powers are those that our neurons have to reciprocally stimulate one another. In this case, silicon-based alien life forms can be intelligent just in case they have these "right" causal powers; i.e. they possess neurons with synaptics connections that have the power to reciprocally stimulate each other. Then we can take any speaker of the Chinese language and cover his neurons in some sort of wrapper which prevents them from being influenced by neurotransmitters and, hence, from having the right causal powers. At this point, "Searle's demon" (an English speaking nanobot, perhaps) sees what is happening and intervenes: he sees through the covering and determines which neurons would have been stimulated and which not and proceeds to stimulate the appropriate neurons and shut down the others himself. The experimental subject's behavior is unaffected. He continues to speak perfect Chinese as before the operation but now the causal powers of his neurotransmitters have been replaced by someone who does not understand the Chinese language. The point is generalizable: for any causal powers, it will always be possible to hypothetically replace them with some sort of Searlian demon which will carry out the operations mechanically. His conclusion is that Searle's is necessarily a dualistic view of the nature of causal powers, "not intrinsically connected with the actual powers of physical objects." &lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, John. (1980) "Artificial Intelligence". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle himself actually does not rule out the possibility for alternate arrangements of matter bringing forth consciousness other than biological brains. He also disputes that Biological naturalism is dualistic in nature in a brief essay entitled ''"Why I Am Not a Property Dualist"''.

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

The '''buttered toast phenomenon''' is an [[observation]] that [[butter]]ed [[toast]] tends to land butter-side down after it falls. It is used an [[idiom]] representing pessimistic outlooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/butter-side-down.html|title='Why does bread always fall buttered side down?' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|last=Martin|first=Gary|website=Phrasefinder|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various people have attempted to determine whether there is an actual tendency for bread to fall in this fashion, with varying results.

==Origins==

The phenomenon is said to be an old proverb from "the north country." Written accounts can be traced to the mid-19th century. The phenomenon is often attributed to a parodic poem of [[James Payn]] from 1884:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apperson|first1=George Latimer|title=Dictionary of Proverbs|date=2005|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd.|location=Ware|isbn=1840223111|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7PMZJqSR4sAC&amp;dq=I%27ve+never+had+a+piece+of+toast+Particularly+long+and+wide%2C+But+fell+upon+the+sanded+floor%2C+And+always+on+the+buttered+side.&amp;q=buttered+toast#v=onepage&amp;q=buttered&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgaUQc8NbTYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%C2%A0James+Payn+from+1884+butter+side+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eUG4bkloJ2&amp;sig=SAta2G677ttPbqmzrWIsGij9iIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6L-pw7vUAhUR92MKHQOHAhcQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0James%20Payn%20from%201884%20butter%20side%20down&amp;f=false|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs|last=Manser|first=Martin H.|date=2007|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=9780816066735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|
I never had a slice of bread,&lt;br /&gt;
Particularly large and wide,&lt;br /&gt;
That did not fall upon the floor,&lt;br /&gt;
And always on the buttered side!
}}

In the past, this has often been considered just a pessimistic belief. A study by the [[BBC]]'s television series ''[[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|Q.E.D.]]'' found that when toast is thrown in the air, it lands butter-side down just one-half of the time (as would be predicted by chance).&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt; However, several scientific studies have found that when toast is dropped from a table (as opposed to being thrown in the air), it does fall butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breakfast at Murphy's (or why the toast lands butter-side down) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331810/Breakfast-at-Murphys-or-why-the-toast-lands-butter-side-down.html |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2001 |first=Robert |last=Matthews |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=R.

== Explanation ==

When toast falls out of one's hand, it does so at an angle, by nature of it having slipped from its previous position, then the toast rotates. Given that tables are usually between two and six feet (0.7 to 1.83 meters), there is enough time for the toast to rotate about one-half of a turn, and thus lands upside down relative to its original position. Since the original position is usually butter-side up, the toast lands butter-side down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buttered Toast and Other Patterns |url=https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_july_98.html |date=July 1998 |website=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |first=Keith |last=Devlin |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the table is over 10 feet (3 meters) tall, the toast will rotate a full 360 degrees, and land butter-side up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite show |title=Butter Side Down |url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/butter-side-down/ |series=[[The Naked Scientists]] |network=[[BBC]] |date=16 December 2007 |first1=Ben |last1=Valsler |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the toast travels horizontally at over 3.6 miles per hour (1.6&amp;nbsp;m/s), the toast will not rotate enough to land butter-side down.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic&gt;{{cite web |title=The Anthropomurphic Principle |url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/anthro/anthro.html |website=Why Do Math? |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] |first=Ian |last=Stewart |date=1995 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the phenomenon is caused by fundamental [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name="European-Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matthews |first=R A J |author-link=Robert Matthews (scientist) |title=Tumbling toast, Murphy's Law and the fundamental constants|journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] |date=18 July 1995 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=172–176 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/16/4/005 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/16/4/005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |bibcode = 1995EJPh...16..172M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==

The added weight of the butter has no effect on the falling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why does a falling piece of toast always seem to land on the buttered side? |url=http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |publisher=How Come? |date=2009-08-17 |first=Kathy |last=Wollard |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830231610/http://www.how-come.net/2009/08/17/why-does-a-falling-piece-of-toast-always-seem-to-land-on-the-buttered-side/ |archivedate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the butter spreads throughout the slice.&lt;ref name=Anthromurphic /&gt;

{{quote
|text=The mass of butter added to toast ( ~4g ) is small compared to the mass of the typical slice of toast (~35g), is spread thinly, and passes into the body of the toast. Its contribution to the total movement of inertia of the toast and rotational dynamics, thus its effect on the toast is negligible.

The following findings are from Mythbusters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythbusterstheexhibition.com/science-content/butter-side-up/#article|title=Mythbusters Museum|website=Mythbusters Museum|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Period of Rotation''': The usual scenario for a falling piece of toast is that a non-rotating slice slides or careens off a horizontal surface, such as a plate or table, over a fairly straight lip, which serves as a momentary fulcrum. In this scenario, the leading edge (or corner) is subject to the downward acceleration of gravity—without a countering force from the horizontal surface—sooner than the trailing edge (or corner). The interval where the leading edge of the toast is accelerating downward faster than the trailing edge imparts angular momentum. Once the toast begins to fall freely, air resistance governs any further change in angular momentum, with the toast serving as a complex airfoil (extremely difficult to analyze, especially if the toast has large, irregular holes). For a short fall, the initial angular momentum will dominate. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the toast to complete a full 360 degree spin. The problem for toast, in the typical case, is that the floor interrupts its fall somewhere in between a 90 degree and 270 toast rotation—this will cause the toast to go from butter-side-up to butter-side-down. With a higher the release point, there is a greater the chance for it to rotate beyond 270 degrees and consequently land butter-side-up. An even higher release point could cause the toast to rotate more than once, and again land butter-side down, but this is no longer a short fall at low velocity, and turbulence in this case should not be neglected. (Frisbee toast would resist the fulcrum torque due to [[gyroscopic effect]]s and probably not accord with this analysis.) 
* '''Moment of Inertia''': At the moment a piece of toast begins flipping towards the kitchen floor, it has inertia—it doesn’t want to stop flipping if it doesn’t have to. Its moment of inertia is determined by the speed at which the toast is flipping, combined with the size and mass of the toast. Most breakfast toast is about the same size and mass, unless you’re in Texas—home of the giant slices that carry the state name. But any way you slice it, the same rules apply. Add a little velocity to the spin as your breakfast goes sliding off your plate—give it a smack to add some inertia and see how it lands.
* '''Angular Momentum''': Just like a frisbee or a gyroscope, your toast gains stability when it spins. In fact, the faster it spins, the more stable it gets. This is angular momentum, or mass in motion around a single point, in action. Newton once claimed that a mass in motion likes to stay that way, and this is definitely true for toast. Once your toast is spinning, it wants to keep spinning—that is, until some other force acts on it, like the floor.

==In popular culture==
[[File:RamirezJelly.png|thumb|right|Ramirez's demonstration of the buttered toast phenomenon to prove that the devil is nearby.]]
In the 2010 [[M. Night Shyamalan]] film ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a group of adults in an elevator become trapped by unknown forces. Slowly over the course of the film, people begin to die in the elevator as the power blinks on and off, pinning the people against each other and creating a false narrative that the others are murderers (However, it is common opinion that the name of the film spoiled this false narrative). In the film, supporting cast member and fictional security guard Ramirez, in his suspicion that there may be unholy forces at play, dropped a slice of toast with jelly on one side, and dropped it on the floor. The toast landed on the jelly-side, after which Ramirez coined the phrase "Jelly Side Down," and subsequently 'proved' that the devil was nearby. However, there is some dispute in the film about whether or not this did actually prove the devil was near.

This phenomenon was also demonstrated and parodied in the October 29, 2013 ''[[Nostalgia Critic]]'' review of ''Devil'', (Reuploaded on July 23, 2016 by [[Channel Awesome]] on YouTube) in which actor [[Doug Walker (actor)|Doug Walker]] plays a priest who uses multiple food items to determine whether or not the Devil is near. After the other items show no sign of the Devil, the priest tosses a piece of toast as the last test. The toast lands jelly side down which means the Devil is near and the end of the world is imminent. Everybody in the church screams and panics as the priest repeatedly shouts, "Jelly side down!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFmdbXvLvI|title=Devil - Nostalgia Critic season 6, episode 40|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2016|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018|author=Doug and Rob Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crushed stone''' or '''angular rock''' is a form of [[construction aggregate]], typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using [[crusher]]s. It is distinct from [[gravel]] which is produced by natural processes of weathering and erosion, and typically has a more rounded shape.

==Uses==
Angular crushed stone is the key material for [[macadam]] road construction which depends on the interlocking of the individual stones' angular faces for its strength.&lt;ref name="isbn90-5699-159-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Max Lay |title=Handbook of Road Technology (Transportation Studies) |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=Washington, DC |year= 1998|pages= 28|isbn=90-5699-159-0 | quote = The strength and stiffness of the course of compacted angular stone came from the mechanical interlock which developed between individual pieces of stone. The principle is still used in modem road construction and since 1820 McAdam's name has been remembered by the term macadam used to describe the courses of unbound angular stone which he introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crushed natural stone is also used similarly without a binder for [[riprap]], railroad [[track ballast]], and [[filter stone]]. It may be used with a binder in a [[composite material]] such as concrete, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], or [[asphalt concrete]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2605-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cunningham, William D. |author2=McKetta, John J. |title=Encyclopedia of chemical processing and design |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |location=New York, N.Y |year=1976 |pages= 284 |isbn=0-8247-2605-7 | quote = Crushed stone can be used without binder for a variety of construction or industrial applications, or it may be mixed with a matrix binding material, such as bituminous or portland  cement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Crushed stone is one of the most accessible [[natural resource]]s, and is a major basic [[raw material]] used by [[construction]], agriculture, and other industries. Despite the low value of its basic products, the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and an indicator of the [[Measures of national income and output|economic well-being of a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/ |title=USGS Minerals Information: Crushed Stone |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The demand for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand for construction materials.&lt;ref name=Tepordei&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stat/ |title= Statistical Compendium - Crushed Stone|accessdate=2007-11-11 | date=1997-11-04 | first = Valentin V. | last = Tepordei |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Minerals Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone resources of the world are very large. High-purity [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] suitable for specialty uses are limited in many geographic areas. Crushed stone substitutes for [[roadbuilding]] include [[sand]] and [[gravel]], and [[slag]]. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, [[sintered]] or expanded [[clay]] or [[shale]], and [[perlite]] or [[vermiculite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stcrumcs07.pdf |title= Stone (Crushed)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |date = January 2007 | first = Jason Christopher | last = Willett |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Mineral Commodity Summaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crushed stone is a high-volume, low-value [[commodity]]. The industry is highly competitive and is characterized by many operations serving local or regional markets. Production costs are determined mainly by the cost of labor, equipment, energy, and water, in addition to the costs of compliance with [[Environmental law|environmental]] and [[Occupational safety and health|safety]] regulations. These costs vary depending on geographic location, the nature of the deposit, and the number and type of products produced. Crushed stone has one of the lowest average by weight values of all mineral commodities. The average unit price increased from US$1.58 per metric ton, f.o.b. plant, in 1970 to US$4.39 in 1990. However, the unit price in constant 1982 dollars fluctuated between US$3.48 and US$3.91 per metric ton for the same period. Increased [[productivity]] achieved through increased use of [[automation]] and more efficient equipment was mainly responsible for maintaining the prices at this level.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

Transportation is a major factor in the delivered price of crushed stone. The cost of moving crushed stone from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, crushed stone is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving crushed stone quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. [[Economies of scale]], which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

==United States statistical data==
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], 1.72&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes of crushed stone worth $13.8&amp;nbsp;billion was sold or used in 2006, of which 1.44&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes was used as [[construction aggregate]], 74.9&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used for cement manufacture, and 18.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used to make [[lime (material)|lime]]. Crushed [[marble]] sold or used totaled 11.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, the majority of which was ground very fine and used as [[calcium carbonate]].

In 2006, 9.40&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (almost all [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]) was used for [[soil]] treatment, primarily to reduce [[soil acidity]]. Soils tend to become acidic from heavy use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, unless a [[soil conditioner]] is used. Using aglime  or [[agricultural lime]], a finely-ground limestone or dolomite, to change the soil from acidic to nearly neutral particularly benefits crops by maximizing availability of plant nutrients, and also by reducing aluminum or [[manganese]] toxicity, promoting soil microbe activity, and improving the soil structure.

In 2006, 5.29&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (mostly limestone or dolomite) was used as a flux in [[blast furnaces]] and in certain steel furnaces to react with [[gangue]] minerals (i.e. [[silica]] and silicate impurities) to produce liquid [[slag]] that floats and can be poured off from the much denser molten metal (i.e., iron). The slag cools to become a stone-like material that is commonly crushed and recycled as [[construction aggregate]].

In addition, 4.53&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone was used for fillers and extenders (including asphalt fillers or extenders), 2.71&amp;nbsp;million tonnes for sulfur oxide removal-mine dusting-acid water treatment, and 1.45&amp;nbsp;million tonnes sold or used for poultry grit or mineral food.

Crushed stone is recycled primarily as [[construction aggregate]] or concrete.

==Landscape use==
Crushed stone or '[[road metal]]' is used in [[landscape design]] and gardening for gardens, parks, and municipal and private projects as a [[mulch]], [[walkway]], path, and [[driveway]] pavement, and cell infill for modular [[permeable paving]] units. As a mineral mulch its benefits include erosion control, water conservation, weed suppression, and aesthetic qualities. It is often seen used in [[rock garden]]s and [[cactus garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/mulch/mulchland.html#stone Cornell University: Gardening Resources - mulches]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://landscaping.about.com/od/drivewaysandwalkways1/f/gravel_driveway.htm AboutGardens: Crushed stone driveways]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

'''Decomposed granite''' is classification of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that is derived from [[granite]] via its [[weathering]] to the point that the parent material readily fractures into smaller pieces of weaker rock. Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into a mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles known as [[Grus (geology)|grus]], that in turn may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite. It has practical uses that include its incorporation into [[Road surface|paving]] and [[driveway]] materials, residential gardening materials in arid environments, as well as various types of [[walkway]]s and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]] in [[park]]s. Different colors of decomposed granite are available, deriving from the natural range of granite colors from different quarry sources, and admixture of other natural and synthetic materials can extend the range of decomposed granite properties.

==Definition and composition==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Decomposed granite is [[Rock (geology)|rock]] of [[granitic]] origin that has [[weathering|weathered]] to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles, [[sand]], and [[silt]]-sized particles with some [[clay]]. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.

The parent [[granite]] material is a common type of [[igneous rock]] that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is [[phaneritic]] in texture); it is composed of [[plagioclase feldspar]], [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of [[feldspar]], one of the primary constituents of [[granite]], into the clay mineral [[kaolin]] is one of the important weathering processes.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05&gt;Mitchell, J.K., and Soga, K. (2005) Fundamentals of soil behavior, Third edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., {{ISBN|9780471463023}}, pages 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles,&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt; where, ultimately, the grains of [[silica]] produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt;

==Uses==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[Image:Decomposed granite path.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Decomposed granite path]]
Decomposed granite, as a [[crushed stone]] form, is used as a [[Road surface|pavement]] building material. It is used on [[driveway]]s, [[garden]] [[walkway]]s, [[bocce]] courts and [[pétanque]] terrains, and [[urban park|urban]], [[regional park|regional]], and [[national park]] walkways and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]]. DG can be installed and compacted to meet handicapped accessibility specifications and criteria, such as the ADA standards in the U.S.  Different colors are available based on the various natural ranges available from different quarry sources, and polymeric stabilizers and other additives can be included to change the properties of the natural material. Decomposed granite is also sometimes used as a component of soil mixtures for cultivating [[bonsai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Randy|title=Guidelines For Creating Bonsai Soil|url=http://www.bonsailearningcenter.com/IMAGES/PDF%20Files/Soils.pdf|publisher=Bonsai Learning Center|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Joshua|title=Potting Soils for a Bonsai|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/potting-soils-bonsai-70677.html|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Despeciation''' is the loss of a unique species of animal due to its combining with another previously distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despeciation|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=24093|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[Speciation]] and is much more rare.  It is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique [[species]] but without the associated loss of a biological lineage.

==Example of three-spined sticklebacks==
[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[three-spined stickleback]] (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
For example, Taylor et al.'s genetic analysis of [[three-spined stickleback]]s across six lakes in southwestern [[British Columbia]] found two distinct species in 1977 and 1988 but only one combined species in data from 1997, 2000, and 2002.&lt;ref name=MolEcol&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor EB, Boughman JW, Groenenboom M, Sniatynski M, Schluter D, Gow JL|title=Speciation in reverse: morphological and genetic evidence of the collapse of a three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) species pair.|journal=Mol Ecol|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They concluded that external factors had imperiled the living conditions of the two species, thus eliminating the evolutionary specializations that had kept them unique.

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc. |volume=77 |issue= 5 |year=1996 |pages=853–868 |doi= 10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077&lt;0853:CATERE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1996BAMS...77..853W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural greenhouse effect==
[[File:Diagram showing the Earth's energy budget, which includes the greenhouse effect (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption and image description|250px|Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect]]
{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

All celestial bodies in the Solar System, including planets such as our own, orbit around the Solar System's centre of mass. The sun makes up 99.76% of this mass which is why the centre of mass is extremely close to the sun.

'''Earth's orbit''' is the [[orbit|trajectory]] along which [[Earth]] travels around the [[Sun]]. The [[list of Solar System objects in hydrostatic equilibrium#Planets|average distance]] between the Earth and the Sun is [[astronomical unit|149.60 million km]] (92.96 million mi),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Display=Facts&amp;Object=Sun | title = Sun: Facts &amp; Figures | work = Solar System Exploration | publisher = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate = July 29, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703111716/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun&amp;Display=Facts | archive-date = July 3, 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one complete orbit takes {{gaps|365.256||}}&amp;nbsp;days (1 [[sidereal year]]), during which time Earth has traveled 940&amp;nbsp;million km (584 million mi).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;[[Jean Meeus]], ''Astronomical Algorithms'' 2nd ed, {{ISBN|0-943396-61-1}} (Richmond, VA: Willmann-Bell, 1998) 238. See [[Ellipse#Circumference]]. The formula by Ramanujan is accurate enough.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.0167.

As seen from Earth, the planet's orbital [[prograde motion]] makes the Sun [[diurnal motion|appear to move]] with respect to [[fixed stars|other stars]] at a rate of about 1° (or a Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours) eastward per [[solar day]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Our planet takes about 365 days to orbit the Sun. A full orbit has 360°. That fact demonstrates that each day, the Earth travels roughly 1° in its orbit. Thus, the Sun will appear to move  across the sky relative to the stars by that same amount.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's [[orbital speed]] averages about 30&amp;nbsp;km/s (108,000&amp;nbsp;km/h; 67,000&amp;nbsp;mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter in 7 minutes and the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance]] to the [[Moon]] in 4 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|date=2004-09-01|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=Earth Fact Sheet|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counter[[clockwise]] direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes.

==History of study==
{{main|Heliocentrism}}
[[Image:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Heliocentric Solar System]]
[[Image:geoz wb en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Heliocentrism (lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model (upper panel)]]

[[Heliocentrism]] is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the [[Solar System]] and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to [[geocentrism]], which placed the Earth at the center. [[Aristarchus of Samos]] already proposed a heliocentric model in the 3rd century BC. In the 16th century, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' presented a full discussion of a [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|last = |first = |publisher = Johannes Petreius|date = 1543|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in much the same way as [[Ptolemy]] had presented his geocentric model in the 2nd century. This "[[Copernican revolution]]" resolved the issue of planetary [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. "Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book...had been [printed] over a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] [[Joan Blaeu]] was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Brotton, ''A History of the World in Twelve Maps'', London: Allen Lane, 2012, {{ISBN|9781846140990}} p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Earth==
{{main|Season}}
Because of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (often known as the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called [[polar night]] and [[midnight sun]]. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the [[season]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/|title = What causes the seasons? (NASA)|accessdate = January 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the orbit==
By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s (the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, toward the Sun or away from the Sun) and the [[equinox]]es (the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another). The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere [[winter solstice]] occurs on or about December 21; summer solstice is near June 21; spring equinox is around March 20; and autumnal equinox is about September 23.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/longest-day/equinox-solstice-2010-2019.htm|title = Date &amp; Time of Solstices &amp; Equinoxes|date = August 28, 2013|accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere (e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).

In modern times, Earth's [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] occurs around January 3, and the [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] around July 4 (for other eras, see [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]]). The changing Earth–Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. See "Orbital characteristics" table. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% of the radiation at aphelion.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2005-12-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wseason/wseason.htm|title=Earth's tilt creates seasons|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]] ([[gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1,500,000 [[kilometer]]s (0.01 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in radius, or approximately 4 times the average distance to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vázquez, M.|author2=Montañés Rodríguez, P.|author3=Palle, E.|date=2006|url= http://www.iac.es/folleto/research/preprints/files/PP06024.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Earth as an Object of Astrophysical Interest in the Search for Extrasolar Planets|publisher=Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias|accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For the Earth, the Hill radius is

:&lt;math&gt;R_H = a \left(\frac{m}{3M}\right)^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{3 \cdot 332\,946}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the maximal distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects orbiting the Earth must be within this radius, otherwise they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[Apsis|apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit. The orbital ellipse goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the perihelion (periapsis — nearest point to the Sun) on anywhere from January 2 to January 5, the point of March equinox on  March 19, 20, or 21, the point of June solstice on June 20, 21, or 22, the aphelion (apoapsis — farthest point from the Sun) on anywhere from July 3 to July 5, the September equinox on September 22, 23, or 24, and the December solstice on December 21, 22, or 23.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The diagram shows an exaggerated shape of Earth's orbit; the actual orbit is less eccentric than pictured.

Because of the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt)|axial tilt]] of the Earth in its orbit, the maximal intensity of Sun rays hits the Earth 23.4 degrees north of equator at the June Solstice (at the '''[[Tropic of Cancer]]'''), and 23.4 degrees south of equator at the December Solstice (at the '''[[Tropic of Capricorn]]''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=551|title = What is the significance of the Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle?|date = |accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
{{main|Stability of the Solar System}}
Mathematicians and astronomers (such as [[Laplace]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Gauss]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Kolmogorov]], [[Vladimir Arnold]], and [[Jürgen Moser]]) have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions, and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive "proofs" of stability for the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astropvhysics|editor-last=Murdin|editor-first=Paul|id=article 2198|url=http://eaa.iop.org/abstract/0333750888/2198|last=Laskar|first=J.|title=Solar System: Stability|date=2001|publisher=[[Institute of Physics Publishing]]|location=Bristol}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By most predictions, Earth's orbit will be relatively stable over long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gribbin|first=John|title=Deep simplicity : bringing order to chaos and complexity|date=2004|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6256-0|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Jacques Laskar]]'s work indicated that the Earth's orbit (as well as the orbits of all the inner planets) can become chaotic and that an error as small as 15 meters in measuring the initial position of the Earth today would make it impossible to predict where the Earth would be in its orbit in just over 100 million years' time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/national/earth-venus-smash-up-possible/story-e6frfkp9-1225732704812|title = Earth-Venus smash-up possible|last = |first = |date = June 11, 2009|work = |access-date = Jan 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling the Solar System is a subject covered by the [[n-body problem]].

[[File:Earth's shadow and Belt of Venus.jpg|thumb|220px|Earth's shadow (blue) and the [[Belt of Venus]] (pink) at [[dawn]], seen above the horizon where the sky meets the sea, looking west from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]], [[San Francisco]].&lt;br/&gt;
{{small|(Note: The lowest blue-grey area is the surface of the [[Pacific Ocean]], not the sky.)}}]]

'''Earth's shadow''' or '''Earth shadow''' is the [[shadow]] that [[Earth]] itself casts onto [[Earth's atmosphere|its atmosphere]] and into [[outer space]], toward the [[antisolar point]]. During [[Twilight#Civil twilight|twilight]] (both early [[dusk]] and late [[dawn]]), the shadow's visible fringe (sometimes called the '''dark segment''' or '''twilight wedge'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=twilight_wedge&lt;/ref&gt;) appears in a clear [[sky]] as a dark and [[diffuse]]d band low above the [[horizon]].

==Appearance==
[[File:Golden Gate Bridge, the Belt of Venus and the Earth's shadow.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth's shadow and the [[Belt of Venus]] at [[dusk]], looking east from the [[Marin Headlands]] just north of [[San Francisco]] in October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;{{small|(Note: A thin layer of greyish cloud partially obscures the horizon in this image.)}}]]

Earth's shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the "civil" stage of [[twilight]], assuming the sky is clear and the [[horizon]] is relatively unobstructed. The shadow's fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over [[azimuth|180°]] of the horizon&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt; opposite the [[Sun]], i.e. in the eastern sky at [[dusk]] and in the western sky at [[dawn]]. Before [[sunrise]], Earth's shadow appears to recede as the Sun rises; after [[sunset]], the shadow appears to rise as the Sun sets.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;

Earth's shadow is best seen when the horizon is low, such as over the sea, and when the sky conditions are clear. In addition, the higher the observer's [[elevation]] is to view the horizon, the sharper the shadow appears.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Belt of Venus==
{{main|Belt of Venus}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Full moon]] rising, as seen through the Belt of Venus. A very small part of the Earth's shadow (dark blue) is also visible in this image, but the horizon here is too high for more of the Earth's shadow to be seen.]]

A related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the [[Belt of Venus]], or anti-twilight arch, a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of Earth's shadow, named after the [[planet]] [[Venus]] which, when visible, is typically located in this region of the sky.
No [[terminator (solar)|defined line]] divides the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band blends into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

The Belt of Venus is quite a different phenomenon from the [[afterglow]], which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky.

===Color===
When the Sun is near the horizon around [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]], the sunlight appears reddish. This is because the light rays are penetrating an especially [[air mass (astronomy)|thick layer]] of the atmosphere, which works as a filter, [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] all but the longer (redder) wavelengths. 

From the observer's perspective, the red sunlight directly illuminates [[particulates|small particles]] in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the Sun. The red light is [[backscatter]]ed to the observer, which is the reason why the [[Belt of Venus]] appears pink. 

The lower the setting Sun descends, the less defined the boundary between Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus appears. This is because the setting Sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere. There the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present, and the eye only sees the "normal" (usual) blue sky, which is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] from air molecules. Eventually, both Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus dissolve into the darkness of the [[night sky]].&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Color of lunar eclipses==
{{main|Lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Near Greatest Eclipse 20101221 0011-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|A total [[lunar eclipse]] on [[December 2010 lunar eclipse|December 21, 2010]], shows the reddish light falling on the Moon's surface.]]

Earth's shadow is as curved as the planet is, and its [[umbra]] extends {{cvt|1,400,000|km|mi}} into outer space. (The [[antumbra]], however, extends indefinitely.) When the [[Sun]], Earth, and the [[Moon]] are [[syzygy (astronomy)|aligned perfectly]] (or nearly so), with Earth between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet, such that the shadow gradually darkens the [[full Moon]], causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. 

Even during a total lunar eclipse, a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the Moon. This indirect sunlight has been [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] as it passed through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The air molecules and [[particulates]] in Earth's atmosphere [[Raleigh scattering|scatter]] the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight; thus, the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the Moon, in the same way that light at [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]] appears reddish. This weak red illumination gives the eclipsed Moon a dimly reddish or [[copper]] color.&lt;ref name=earth-shadow/&gt;

{{wiktionary|Earthling}}

'''Earthling''', a term identifying inhabitants of the planet [[Earth]]. Earthlings are the only form of life in the universe whose existence is known. Similar terms are '''Terran''' and '''Gaian'''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==History==
Historically, the term "earthling" referred to a mortal inhabitant of the Earth as opposed to spiritual or divine entities.  In [[Early Modern English]], the word was used with the intention of contrasting "earth" with "[[heaven]]", and so presenting man as an inhabitant of the [[sublunary sphere]], as opposed to heavenly creatures or [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe]], ''Christ's Tears'' (1593, 1613), p. 124: "Wee (of all earthlings) are Gods vtmost subiects.";&lt;br&gt; Drummond of Hawthornden, ''Poems'' (1711), p. 31 (written ca. 1630): "Nature gaz'd on with such a curious eye, That earthlings oft her deem'd a deity."&lt;br&gt; Cited after ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The derivation from the noun ''[[:wikt:earth|earth]]'' by means of the suffix ''[[:wikt:-ling|-ling]]'' is already seen in [[Old English]] ''yrþling'', in the meaning "ploughman". The sense of "inhabitant of earth" is first attested in the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earthling |title=earthling |last1= Harper |first1=Douglas |accessdate=18 August 2018 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in science fiction dates to 1949, in ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

The word "Human" has the same imposed meaning, since it originates from a [[PIE]] word ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰmṓ|*ǵʰmṓ]]'' "earthling" &lt; ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰéǵʰōm|*dʰéǵʰōm]]'' "earth". Compare [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:homo|homo]]'' "human" and ''[[wikt:humus|humus]]'' "earth, soil".{{or|date=April 2018}}

==Modern use==
Its modern use in science fiction literature contrasts "Earth" (the planet) with outer space or hypothetical other planets with sapient life. The term was often used in 1950s science fiction film and novels by aliens to express a disdainful or patronizing tone towards creatures from Earth. The meaning "creature from planet Earth" in the context of space travel may be extended to non-human species, as in "Russia fetes dog [[Laika]], first earthling in space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/11/us-russia-space-dog-idUSL1117596720080411 |title=Russia fetes dog Laika, first earthling in space |last1= Solovyov |first1=Dmitry |last2= Pearce |first2=Tim (ed.) |date=11 April 2008 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary effect aimed for is a [[distancing effect]], inviting the readers to contemplate their own species as it might be seen from an external point of view. There is also a belittling effect, in parallel with the use of the -ling suffix in such diminutives as "duckling" and "gosling". Especially in 1950s science fiction, use of the term is a conscious reversal of common assumptions of [[anthropocentrism]] or [[human exceptionalism]], and may be an example of an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]].{{or|date=April 2018}}

In some science fiction media (such as the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise and the 2014 movie ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'') the term "Terran" is used as a term for humans, stemming from "terra", the Latin word for Earth. In the original run of the [[BBC]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the phrase "tellurian" is used.

The '''Ekeby oak tree''' ({{lang-sv|Ekebyhovseken}}) is an oak tree in [[Ekerö]] outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], close to [[Ekebyhov Castle]]. It is the largest living deciduous tree in Sweden by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3GPBT_mmdo12-ekebyhovseken?guid=da0e67b7-2af4-4a2d-89a3-06665f703190 |title=GC3GPBT MMDO12: Ekebyhovseken (Traditional Cache) in Stockholm, Sweden created by fredrikr |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ekeby oak is approximately 500 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enjoysweden.se/object/eker%C3%B6j%C3%A4tten/ |title=Ekebyhovseken  |publisher=Enjoysweden.se |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared a [[natural monument]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/sthlm/nationalparker-i-stockholms-lan?rm=print Nationalparker i Stockholms län], ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', May 21, 2009 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many old trees around Ekebyhov Castle; the oak, sometimes called ''Ekeröjätten'' (the Ekerö giant) stands alone in a field south of the castle, where it had no competition for space from other trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norgig.com/national/se/big_trees.html |title=Sveriges största träd |publisher=Norgig.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was measured in 2008 as the largest tree by volume in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekero.se/upload/natur_miljo/info%20web%20v%C3%A5rd%20av%20gamla%20tr%C3%A4d%20ver2%20110127.pdf "Vård av gamla träd i Ekebyhov"], Ekero.se, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111114000954/http://ekero.se/upload/natur_miljo/info%20web%20v%C3%A5rd%20av%20gamla%20tr%C3%A4d%20ver2%20110127.pdf archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 27 January 2011 (pdf) {{sv icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]]. Major reference = &lt;ref name="engineeringtoolbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fossil-fuels-energy-content-d_1298.html |title=Fossil and Alternative Fuels - Energy Content (2008).  |publisher=Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

[[File:Coast Garter Snake.jpg|thumb|[[Garter snake]] is an example of escape and radiate coevolution.{{why|date=April 2017}}]]
'''Escape and radiate coevolution''' is a multistep process that hypothesizes that an organism under constraints from other organisms will develop new defenses, allowing it to "escape" and then "radiate" into differing species. After a novel defense has been acquired, an organism is able to escape predation and rapidly multiply into new species because of relaxed selective pressure. There are many possible mechanisms available varying between different types of organisms, however they must be novel in order for escape to allow for radiation. This theory applies to predator-prey associations, but is most often applied to plant-herbivore associations.

This form of [[coevolution]] can be complex but is essential to understanding the vast biological diversity among organisms today. Out of the many forms of coevolution, escape and radiate is most likely responsible for providing the most diversity. This is due to the nature of the "evolutionary arms race" and the continuous cycle of counter adaptations. It is a relatively new field of study and is rapidly gaining credibility. To date, there has not been a formal study published specifically for escape and radiate coevolution.

== Origin of Theory ==

This theory originated in a paper by Ehrlich and Raven, 1964, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution".&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964/&gt; It outlined and laid the foundations of the concept. However, the term "escape and radiate" was not coined until Thompson's 1989 "Concepts of Coevolution".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The theory has not yet been fully analyzed, however, as since its origins it has grown in importance among evolutionary biologists and botanists.

== Escape ==

In order for an organism to "escape", and then radiate into varying species it needs a mechanism to escape. These defense mechanisms vary widely and differ for different types of organisms. Plants use chemical defenses in the form of secondary metabolites or [[allelochemicals]]. These allelochemicals inhibit the growth, behavior, and health of herbivores, allowing plants to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, Terry. "Allelochemicals in plants." Allelopathy in Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry. Springer New York, 2008. 63-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a plant allelochemical are alkaloids that can inhibit protein synthesis in herbivores. Other forms of plant defense include mechanical defenses such as [[Thigmonastic movements|thigmonasty movements]] which have the plant leaves close in response to tactile stimulation. Indirect mechanisms plant include shedding of plant leaves so less leaves are available which deters herbivores, growth in locations in that are difficult to reach, and even mimicry. For organisms other than plants, examples of defense mechanisms allowing for escape include camouflage, [[aposematism]],&lt;ref&gt;Mappes, Johanna, Nicola Marples, and John A. Endler. "The complex business of survival by aposematism." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20.11 (2005): 598-603.&lt;/ref&gt; heightened senses and physical capabilities, and even defensive behaviors such as feigning death. An example of an organism using one of these defense mechanisms is the [[granular poison frog]] which defends itself through aposematism. It is important to understand that in order for escape and radiate coevolution to occur, it is necessary that the developed defense is novel rather than previously established.

Induced defense stemming from adaptive [[phenotypic plasticity]] may help a plant defend itself against multiple enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Induced plant defense: evolution of induction and adaptive phenotypic plasticity." Inducible plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores: biochemistry, ecology, and agriculture. American Phytopathological Society Press, St. Paul, MN (1999): 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenotypic plasticity occurs when an organism undergoes an environmental change forcing a change altering its behavior, physiology, etc. These induced defenses allow for an organism to escape.

== Radiate ==

Radiation is the evolutionary process of diversification of a single species into multiple forms. It includes the physiological and ecological diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Schluter, Dolph. The ecology of adaptive radiation. Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of radiation including adaptive, concordant, and discordant radiation however escape and radiate coevolution does not always follow those specific types.

This eventually leads to the question, why does escape allow for radiation?  Once a novel defense has been acquired, the attacking organism which had evolved adaptations that allowed it to predate is now up against a new defense that it has not yet been evolved to encounter. This gives the defending organism the advantage, and therefore time to rapidly multiply unopposed by the previously attacking organism. This ultimately leads to the physiological and ecological diversity within the rapidly multiplying lineage, hence radiation.

== Importance ==

A full study analyzing the effects of escape and radiate coevolution has not yet been completed which hinders knowing how applicable this form of coevolution could be to other areas of study, or global concerns, only hypotheses of its effects can be made. Improved agriculture, conservation, biological diversity, and epidemiology are just some of the areas that could potentially be helped through the study of coevolution and its specific hypotheses such as escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "The raw material for coevolution." Oikos (1999): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
A theory as to why we see such vast biological diversity today may be because of escape and radiate coevolution. After the organism escapes, it then radiates into multiple species, and spreads geographically. Evidence of escape and radiate coevolution can be seen through the starburst effect in plant and herbivore [[clades]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution: the geographic mosaic of coevolutionary arms races." Current Biology 15.24 (2005): R992-R994.&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing clades of predator-prey associations, although it varies, the starburst effect is a good indicator that escape and radiate coevolution may be occurring. Eventually this cycle must come to an end because adaptations that  entail costs (allocation of resources, vulnerability to other predators) that at some point outweigh their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;"Coevolution." Interactions Among Species. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Nov. 1993. &lt;http://neko.bio.utk.edu/~ijuric/EEB460_&lt;/ref&gt;
Escape and radiate coevolution may support parallel [[cladogenesis]], wherein plant and herbivore [[phylogenies]] might match with ancestral insects exploiting ancestral plants. This is significant because it allows researchers to hypothesize about the relationships between ancestral organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Insect Ecology: Behavior, Populations and Communities By R. F. Denno, M. D. Eubanks&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, there have not yet been any known examples specifically involving escape and radiate coevolution being used for hypothesizing ancestral relationships.

Many times the organism that has "escaped" continuously undergoes selective pressure because the predator it has escaped from evolves to create another adaptation in response, causing the process to continue. These "offensive" traits developed by predators range widely. For example, herbivores can develop an adaptation that allows for improved detoxification which allow to overcome plant defenses, thus causing escape and radiate coevolution to continue. Often the term "evolutionary arms race" is used to illustrate the idea that continuous evolution is needed to maintain the same relative fitness while the two species are coevolving. This idea also ties in with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]]. Counter adaptations among two organisms through escape and radiate coevolution is a major driving force behind diversity.

Escape and radiate coevolution produces much more biological variation than other evolutionary mechanisms. For instance, cospeciation is important for diversity amongst species that share a symbiotic relationship, however this does not create nearly as much diversity in comparison to reciprocal evolutionary change due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution." eLS (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence of rapid diversification following a novel adaptation is shown through the evolution of resin and latex canal tubes in 16 different lineages of plants. Plants with resin or latex canals can easily defend themselves against insect herbivores. When lineages of canal bearing plants are compared to the lineages of canal free plants, it is apparent that canal bearing plants are far more diverse, supporting escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Brian D., David E. Dussourd, and Charles Mitter. "Escalation of plant defense: do latex and resin canals spur plant diversification?." American Naturalist (1991): 881-900.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==

=== Plant-herbivore ===
[[File:Monarch In May.jpg|592 KBpx|thumb|right|Erlich and Raven's Classic butterfly model]]

The most popular examples of escape and radiate coevolution are of plant-herbivore associations. The most classic example is of butterflies and plants outlined in Ehrlich and Raven's original paper, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution.". Erlich and Raven found in 1964 that hostplants for butterflies had a wide range of chemical defenses, allowing them to escape herbivory. Butterflies who developed novel counter detoxification mechanisms against the hostplants chemical defenses were able to utilize the hostplant resources.&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964&gt;Ehrlich, P. R., &amp; Raven, P. H. (1964). Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution. Evolution, 586-608.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of stepwise adaptation and counteradaptation among the butterflies and hostplants is continuous and creates vast diversity.

Tropical trees may also escape and defend themselves. Trees growing in high light were predicted to have few chemical defenses, but rapid synchronous leaf expansion and low leaf nutritional quality during expansion. Species growing in low light have high levels of different chemical defenses, poor nutritional quality and asynchronous leaf expansion. Depending on the level of light the trees were growing in influenced the type of defenses they obtained, either chemical or through leaf expansion. The trees exposed to less light developed various chemicals to defend themselves against herbivores, a defense not utilizing light. This study was significant because it illustrates the separation between defenses and their relationship with an organism escaping and radiating into other species. Development of novel defenses does not necessarily imply that escape is possible for a species of plant if herbivores are adapting at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;Kursar, Thomas A., and Phyllis D. Coley. "Convergence in defense syndromes of young leaves in tropical rainforests." Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 31.8 (2003): 929-949.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asclepiascommon.JPG|thumb|[[Common milkweed]] plant bears [[latex]] tubes to ward off herbivores.]]

Milkweed plants contain [[latex]]-filled canals which deter insect herbivores. Latex is toxic for small herbivores because it disrupts sodium and potassium levels. This has allowed for milkweeds to "escape" and become extremely diverse. There are over 100 different species of milkweeds which shows how diverse the plant is, with escape and radiate coevolution playing a very large role in creating such a high number of species.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Natural selection on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) by a community of specialized insect herbivores." Evolutionary Ecology Research 7.5 (2005): 651.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish-water flea ===

Key adaptations are adaptations that allow a group of organisms to diversify. ''Daphnia lumholtzi'' is a water flea that is able to form rigid head spines in response to chemicals released when fish are present. These phenotypically plastic traits serve as an induced defense against these predators. A study showed that ''Daphnia pulicaria'' is competitively superior to ''D. lumholtzi'' in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defenses and became the dominant water flea in the region. This switch in dominance suggests that the induced defense against fish predation could represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of ''D. lumholtzi''. A defensive trait that qualifies as a key adaptation is most likely an example of escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Katharina, and Ralph Tollrian. "Inducible defences as key adaptations for the successful invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi in North America?." Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 276.1663 (2009): 1865-1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacteria-phage ===

The theory can be applied at the microscopic level such as to [[bacteria]]-[[phage]] relationships. Bacteria were able to diversify and escape through resistance to phages. The diversity among the hosts and parasites differed among the range of infection and resistance. The implication of this study to humans is its important to understanding the evolution of infectious organisms, and preventing diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Best, A., et al. "The Evolution of Host‐Parasite Range." The American naturalist 176.1 (2010): 63-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolution]] has been an important theme in fiction, including [[speculative evolution]] in [[science fiction]], since the late 19th century, though it began before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views as well as Darwin's.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.

==Context==

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], as set out in his 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', is the dominant theory in modern biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archivedate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism ([[orthogenesis]]) and [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]], is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=69 | issue=| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressionism==
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]]'s allegorical 1781 story ''{{ill|La découverte Australe par un homme volant|fr|La Découverte australe}}'' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man).&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; 

The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', where the villain Faora states: "The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins." She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardwick |first1=Kayla M. |title=Natural selection at the movies: Only the bad guys evolve |url=https://nothinginbiology.org/2014/10/22/natural-selection-at-the-movies-only-the-bad-guys-evolve/ |website=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense [except in the light of evolution] |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of "bad-guy traits" the [[Morlock]]s in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 ''[[The Time Machine]]'', the bugs' [[caste (insect)|caste system]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1959 ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and the effective colonisation by [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' aliens.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014/&gt;

==Lamarckism==
{{see|Lamarckism}}

In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'' and his 1894 ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'', [[J.-H. Rosny]]'s 1887 ''Les Xipéhuz'' and his 1910 ''La mort de la terre'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s 1901 ''La grande forêt, le village aérien''. The Lamarckist philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s creative evolution driven by the supposed [[élan vital]] likely inspired [[J. D. Beresford]]'s English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 ''[[The Hampdenshire Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

==Darwinism==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for a 1906 edition of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 "[[The War of the Worlds]]" by [[Henrique Alvim Corréa]]]]
{{see|Speculative evolution}}

Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer "[[survival of the fittest]]" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's ''The Time Machine'' already mentioned, his 1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'', and his 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; More broadly, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899 ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[R. L. Stevenson]]'s 1886 ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote an optimistic tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. This influenced [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 ''[[Last and First Men]]'', which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]''. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or [[intelligent machine]]s. For instance, [[Olof Johannesson]]'s 1966 ''The Great Computer'' gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 ''Galapagos'' is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">'''Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy (IPSS)''' is a Passive Seismic Low Frequency technique used for mapping potential oil and gas hydrocarbon accumulations.

It is part of the geophysical techniques also known under the generic naming [[passive seismic]] which includes also the [[Seismic tomography|Passive Seismic Tomography]] and Micro Seismic Monitoring for petroleum, gas and geothermal applications. In a larger scale, Passive Seismic includes the [[IRIS Consortium|Global Seismic Network]] earthquakes monitoring (GSN).

Regarding petroleum and geothermal exploration (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks is the main responsible for the low frequency reservoir-related [http://www.pgexploration.com/resources/publications/ wavefield absorption].
 
The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by [https://books.google.it/books?id=_TkPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=mesoscopic+homogeneous+seismic+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJtCq_D0ip&amp;sig=uPNi3LY5j98O84W-7Sdntefr0sU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuKqmqazXAhVPahoKHbHdBsAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoscopic%20homogeneous%20seismic%20models&amp;f=false mesoscopic homogeneous models]) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range.
 
Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low frequency wave field.

Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy techniques quantifies then the absorption and the wave field dispersion within the low frequency bandwidth giving the most predominant areas linked with possible oil-saturated and porous media.

The low frequency seismic field is not usually reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the vibroseis currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]].

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]].

| [[WR 104#Effects on Earth|Peter Tuthill]]
| In approximately 300,000 years, [[WR 104]], a [[triple star]], is expected to explode in a [[supernova]]. It has been suggested that it may produce a [[gamma ray burst]] that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of 30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth.

| The [[Sun]]'s increasing brightness causes the rate of [[weathering]] of the planet's [[crust (geology)|crust]] to increase. This will cause the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]] to drop dramatically, making [[photosynthesis]] in [[plants]] impossible. This will very likely cause a mega [[mass extinction]] of the Earth's [[vegetation]]. The lack of [[oxygen]]-producing plants will cause [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to disappear as well as the [[ozone layer]], making [[animal]] life impossible. Even if photosynthesis was still possible, rising surface tempatures from the brighter sun will make complex life (plants and animals) impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44733">This is a '''list of herbaria''', organized first by continent where the herbarium is located, then within each continent by size of the collection. A [[herbarium]] (''plural'' "herbaria") is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens. These specimens may be whole plants or plant parts: these will usually be in a dried form, mounted on a sheet, but depending upon the material may also be kept in alcohol or other preservative. The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]] and in [[phycology]] to describe a collection of [[algae]].

To preserve their form and color, plants collected in the field are spread flat on sheets of newsprint and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labeled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned and the case disinfected.

Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets. Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. Herbaria also preserve an historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time. In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area, or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in an herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

A '''species''' is regarded as '''[[Invasive species|invasive]]''' if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, threatening agriculture and/or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term '''invasive species''' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]], for which see [[List of introduced species]].

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level.

Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mechanical philosophy''' is a [[natural philosophy]] describing the universe as similar to a large-scale mechanism. Mechanical philosophy is associated with the [[scientific revolution]] of [[Early Modern]] Europe. One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published in 1651.

Some [[Intellectual history |intellectual historians]] and [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to [[disenchantment]] and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or [[angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Merchant |first= Carolyn|date= 1990 |title= The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o_l2uMk2KjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Harper Collins |chapter= Chapters 4, 9, 10 |isbn= 0062505955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[Christianity]] and [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | chapter = Chapter 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism and determinism ==
Some ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. This view was closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of "mechanical laws": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a [[determinism]].  If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.

==Development of the mechanical philosophy==
{{details|corpuscularianism}}
The natural philosophers directly concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[René Descartes]]. Also involved were the English thinkers [[Sir Kenelm Digby]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Walter Charleton]]; and the Dutch natural philosopher [[Isaac Beeckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret J. Osler|title=Divine Will and the Mechanical Philosophy: Gassendi and Descartes on Contingency and Necessity in the Created World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtPISpxGacAC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=7 June 2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-52492-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] used "mechanical philosophers" to refer both to those with a theory of "corpuscles" or [[atom]]s of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the [[clockwork universe]] view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and [[Galileo Galilei]]; it would include [[Nicolas Lemery]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of "mechanical philosophy" dates back to 1952 and [[Marie Boas Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Fisher|title=Pierre Gassendi's Philosophy And Science: Atomism for Empiricists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fLSO6y6DhUC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11996-3|pages=205 with note 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the [[Royal Society]]. In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy Porter|author2=Katharine Park|author3=Lorraine Daston|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 July 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57244-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbes and the mechanical philosophy===
One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) by Hobbes (1651); the book's second chapter invokes the [[principle of inertia]], foundational for the mechanical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Patricia Springborg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes's Leviathan |date= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-54521-1 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. [[Richard Westfall]] deems him a mechanical philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sophie. Roux|author2=Daniel Garber|title=The Mechanization of Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USOoK5tRabAC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-4345-8|page=11 note 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental [[physics]] with [[geometry]]; and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Janiak|author2=Eric Schliesser|title=Interpreting Newton: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IskjtmGJoC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76618-0|page=34 with note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and the mechanical philosophy===
Descartes was also a mechanist. A [[substance dualist]], he argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

===Beeckman and the mechanical philosophy===
Isaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books ''Centuria'' and ''Journal'' is grounded in two components: matter and motion.  To explain matter, Beeckman relied on  atomism philosophy which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life.  To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkel|first=Klaas|date=2013|title=Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion : Mechanical Philosophy in the Making|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3318707.|journal=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=|pages=76-77|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton and the mechanical philosophy===
[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies|his occult research]] have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]].

==The mechanist thesis==
The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D.

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

{{Fibre sidebar}}

'''Natural fibers''' or '''natural''' '''fibres''' (see [[Spelling differences#-re.2C -er|spelling differences]]) are [[fibre]]s that are produced by plants, animals, and geological processes.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Maya Jacob|last2=Thomas|first2=Sabu|date=2008-02-08|title=Biofibres and biocomposites|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144861707002974|journal=Carbohydrate Polymers|volume=71|issue=3|pages=343–364|doi=10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.05.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used as a component of [[Composite material|composite]] materials, where the orientation of fibers impacts the properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9849324139|title=Natural fibres : advances in science and technology towards industrial applications : from science to market|last=Sousa,|first=Fangueiro, Raul Manuel Esteves de|last2=Sohel,|first2=Rana,|isbn=9789401775137|oclc=938890984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural fibers can also be [[Felted|matted]] into sheets to make products such as [[paper]], [[felt]] or fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doelle|first=Klaus|date=2013-08-25|title=New Manufacturing Method for Paper Filler and Fiber Material|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/1091089/|language=English|doi=10.2172/1091089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillick|first=T.

The earliest evidence of humans using fibers is the discovery of [[wool]] and dyed [[flax]] fibers found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back  to 36,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;Balter M.

Compared to composites reinforced with [[glass fiber]]s, composites with natural fibers have advantages such as lower density, better thermal insulation, and reduced skin irritation. Further, unlike glass fibers, natural fibers can be broken down by bacteria once they are no longer in use.

Natural fibers are good sweat absorbents and can be found in a variety of textures. Cotton fibers made from the cotton plant, for example, produce fabrics that are light in weight, soft in texture, and which can be made in various sizes and colors. Clothes made of natural fibers such as cotton are often preferred over clothing made of [[synthetic fiber]]s by people living in hot and humid climates.

==General Information==
Natural fibers are made from [[Fiber crop|plant]], [[Animal fiber|animal]], and [[Mineral fiber|mineral]] sources. Natural fibers can be classified according to their origin.

=== Plant fibres ===

|-
|[[Bast fibre]]
|Bast fibers are collected from the outer cell layers of the plant's stem. These fibers are used for durable yarn, fabric, packaging, and paper.

|}

=== Animal fibers ===
[[Animal fiber]]s generally comprise [[protein]]s such as [[collagen]], [[keratin]] and [[fibroin]]; examples include [[silk]], [[sinew]], [[wool]], [[catgut]], [[angora wool|angora]], [[mohair]] and [[alpaca#Fiber|alpaca]].

* Animal hair (wool or hairs): Fiber or [[wool]] taken from animals or hairy mammals. e.g. sheep's wool, goat hair ([[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], [[mohair]]), [[alpaca wool|alpaca hair]], horse hair, etc.
* Silk fiber: Fiber secreted by glands (often located near the mouth) of insects during the preparation of [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s.
* Avian fiber: Fibers from birds, e.g. [[feather]]s and feather fiber.

=== Chitin ===
{{Main|Chitin}}[[File:Chitin.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of chitin chains]]
Chitin is the second most abundant natural polymer in the world, with collagen being the first. It is a “linear polysaccharide of β-(1-4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Chitin is highly crystalline and is usually composed of chains organized in a β sheet. Due to its high crystallinity and chemical structure, it is insoluble in many solvents. It also has a low toxicity in the body and is inert in the intestines. Chitin also has antibacterial properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinaudo|first=Marguerite|date=2006-07-01|title=Chitin and chitosan: Properties and applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079670006000530|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|volume=31|issue=7|pages=603–632|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitin forms crystals that make fibrils that become surrounded by proteins. These fibrils can bundle to make larger fibers that contribute to the hierarchical structure of many biological materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Marc André|last2=Chen|first2=Po-Yu|last3=Lin|first3=Albert Yu-Min|last4=Seki|first4=Yasuaki|date=2008-01-01|title=Biological materials: Structure and mechanical properties|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642507000254|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–206|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fibrils can form randomly oriented networks that provide the mechanical strength of the organic layer in different biological materials.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Marc A.|last2=Chen|first2=Po-Yu|last3=Lopez|first3=Maria I.|last4=Seki|first4=Yasuaki|last5=Lin|first5=Albert Y. M.|date=2011-07-01|title=Biological materials: A materials science approach|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751616110001128|journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials|series=Special Issue on Natural Materials / Papers from the Third International Conference on the Mechanics of Biomaterials and Tissues|volume=4|issue=5|pages=626–657|doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitin provides protection and structural support to many living organisms. It makes up the cell walls of fungi and yeast, the shells of mollusks, the [[exoskeleton]]s of insects and [[arthropod]]s. In shells and exoskeletons, the chitin fibers contribute to their hierarchical structure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Materials Science|last=Meyers|first=M.A.|last2=Chen|first2=P.Y.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2014|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, pure chitin (100% [[acetylation]]) does not exist. It instead exists as a [[copolymer]] with chitin's deacetylated derivative, chitosan. When the acetylized composition of the copolymer is over 50% acetylated it is chitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This copolymer of chitin and chitosan is a random or block copolymer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chitosan ===
{{Main|Chitosan}}[[File:Chitosan_chemical_structural_formula.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of chitosan chain]]
Chitosan is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. When the acetylized composition of the copolymer is below 50% it is chitosan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chitosan is a semicrystalline “polymer of β-(1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  One difference between chitin and chitosan is that chitosan is soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. Chitosan is easier to process that chitin, but it is less stable because it is more hydrophilic and has pH sensitivity. Due to its ease of processing, chitosan is used in biomedical applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collagen ===
{{Main|Collagen}}Collagen is a structural protein, often referred to as “the steel of biological materials”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968439866|title=BIOMECHANICS : mechanical properties of living tissues (1).|last=C.|first=FUNG, Y.|date=1981-01-01|publisher=SPRINGER|isbn=1475717520|oclc=968439866}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple types of collagen: [[Type I collagen|Type I]] (comprising skin, tendons and ligaments, vasculature and organs, as well as teeth and bone); [[Type II collagen|Type II]] (a component in cartilage); Type III (often found in [[reticular fiber]]s); and others. Collagen has a hierarchical structure, forming triple helices, [[fibril]]s, and fibers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Keratin ===
{{Main|Keratin}}
[[File:Alpha Keratin Basic Structure.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the creation of alpha keratins helical structure.]]
Keratin is a structural protein located at the hard surfaces in many vertebrates. Keratin has two forms, [[α-keratin]] and [[β-keratin]] and are used by different classes of animals. The naming convention for proteins follows that for keratin, alpha keratin is helical and beta keratin is sheet like. Alpha keratin is found in mammalian hair, skin, nails, horn and quills, while beta keratin can be found in avian and reptilian species in scales, feathers, and beaks. The two different structures of keratin have dissimilar mechanical properties, as seen in their dissimilar applications. The relative alignment of the keratin fibrils has a significant impact on the mechanical properties. In human hair the filaments of alpha keratin are highly aligned, giving a tensile strength of approximately 200MPa. This tensile strength is an order of magnitude higher than human nails (20MPa), because human hair’s keratin filaments are more aligned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Properties ==
Compared to synthetic fibers, natural fibers tend have decreased stiffness and strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Properties also decrease with the age of the fiber. Younger fibers tend to be stronger and more elastic than older ones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many natural fibers exhibit strain rate sensitivity due to their viscoelastic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fratzl|first=Peter|last2=Weinkamer|first2=Richard|date=2007-11-01|title=Nature’s hierarchical materials|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007964250700045X|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1263–1334|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone contains collagen and exhibits strain rate sensitivity in that the stiffness increases with strain rate, also known as [[Work hardening|strain hardening]]. Spider silk has hard and elastic regions that together contribute to its strain rate sensitivity, these cause the silk to exhibit strain hardening as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Properties of natural fibers are also dependent on the moisture content in the fiber.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Moisture Dependence ===
The presence of water plays a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of natural fibers. Hydrated, biopolymers generally have enhanced ductility and toughness. Water plays the role of a [[plasticizer]], a small molecule easing passage of polymer chains and in doing so increasing ductility and toughness. When using natural fibers in applications outside of their native use, the original level of hydration must be taken into account. For example when hydrated, the Young’s Modulus of collagen decreases from 3.26 to 0.6 GPa and becomes both more ductile and tougher. Additionally the density of collagen decreases from 1.34 to 1.18 g/cm^3.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:19th century knowledge weaving flax hemp jute manila sisal vegetable fibers.jpg|thumb|19th century knowledge weaving [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[Manila hemp]], [[sisal]] and vegetable fibers]]

=== Industrial Use ===
Of industrial value are four animal fibers, wool, silk, camel hair, and angora as well as four plant fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute.  Dominant in terms of scale of production and use is cotton for textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Fibers, 1. Survey|encyclopedia=ULLMANN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY|authors=Erik Frank, Volker Bauch, Fritz Schultze-Gebhardt and Karl-Heinz Herlinger|year=2011|doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_451.pub2|publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural fiber composites ===
{{Main|Biocomposite}}
Natural fibers are also used in composite materials, much like synthetic or glass fibers. These composites, called biocomposites, are a natural fiber in a matrix of synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One of the first biofiber-reinforced plastics in use was a cellulose fiber in phenolics in 1908.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Usage includes applications where energy absorption is important, such as insulation, noise absorbing panels, or collapsable areas in automobiles.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heng|first=Jerry Y. Y.|last2=Pearse|first2=Duncan F.|last3=Thielmann|first3=Frank|last4=Lampke|first4=Thomas|last5=Bismarck|first5=Alexander|date=2007-01-01|title=Methods to determine surface energies of natural fibres: a review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156855407782106492|journal=Composite Interfaces|volume=14|issue=7-9|pages=581–604|doi=10.1163/156855407782106492|issn=0927-6440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural fibers can have different advantages over synthetic reinforcing fibers. Most notably they are biodegradable and renewable. Additionally, they often have low densities and lower processing costs than synthetic materials.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajesh|first=Murugan|last2=Pitchaimani|first2=Jeyaraj|title=Mechanical Properties of Natural Fiber Braided Yarn Woven Composite: Comparison with Conventional Yarn Woven Composite|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1672652916603852|journal=Journal of Bionic Engineering|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=141–150|doi=10.1016/s1672-6529(16)60385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design issues with natural fiber-reinforced composites include poor strength (natural fibers are not as strong as glass fibers) and difficulty with actually bonding the fibers and the matrix. Hydrophobic polymer matrices offer insufficient adhesion for hydrophilic fibers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Nanocomposites ===
{{Main|Nanocomposite}}Nanocomposites are desirable for their mechanical properties. When fillers in a composite are at the [[Nanometre|nanometer]] length scale, the surface to volume ratio of the filler material is high, which influences the bulk properties of the composite more compared to traditional composites. The properties of these nanosized elements is markedly different than that of its bulk constituent.

In regards to natural fibers, some of the best example of nanocomposites appear in biology. [[Bone]], [[Abalone|abalone shell]], [[nacre]], and tooth [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] are all nanocomposites. As of 2010, most synthetic polymer nanocomposites exhibit inferior toughness and mechanical properties compared to biological nanocomposites.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|title=Mechanical Principles of Biological Nanocomposites|last=Ji|first=Baohua|last2=Gao|first2=Huajian|date=2010-07-02|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424|access-date=2017-05-08|bibcode=2010AnRMS..40...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completely synthetic nanocomposites do exist, however nanosized biopolymers are also being tested in synthetic matrices. Several types of protein based, nanosized fibers are being used in nanocomposites. These include collagen, cellulose, chitin and tunican.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These structural proteins must be processed before use in composites.

To use cellulose as an example, [[semicrystalline]] microfibrils are sheared in the amorphous region, resulting in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils are at this points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical. Whiskers of collagen, chitin, and cellulose have all be used to make biological nanocomposites. The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of [[polystyrene]] and polyacrylate.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Traditionally in composite science a strong interface between the matrix and filler is required to achieve favorable mechanical properties. If this is not the case, the phases tend to separate along the weak interface and makes for very poor mechanical properties. In a MCC composite however this is not the case, if the interaction between the filler and matrix is stronger than the filler-filler interaction the mechanical strength of the composite is noticeably decreased.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Alloin|first2=Fannie|last3=Dufresne|first3=Alain|date=March 2005|title=Review of Recent Research into Cellulosic Whiskers, Their Properties and Their Application in Nanocomposite Field|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=6|issue=2|pages=612–626|doi=10.1021/bm0493685|last1=Azizi Samir|first1=My Ahmed Said}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties in natural fiber nanocomposites arise from dispersity and the tendency small fibers to aggregate in the matrix. Because of the high surface area to volume ratio the fibers have a tendency to aggregate, more so than in micro-scale composites. Additionally secondary processing of collagen sources to obtain sufficient purity collagen micro fibrils adds a degree of cost and challenge to creating a load bearing cellulose or other filler based nanocomposite.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Biomaterial/Biocompatibility ===
{{Main|Biomaterial}}Natural fibers often show promise as biomaterials in medical applications. Chitin is notable in particular and has been incorporated into a variety of uses. Chitin based materials have also been used to remove industrial pollutants from water, processed into fibers and films, and used as [[biosensor]]s in the food industry.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=A|last2=Misra|first2=M|last3=Henrichsen|first3=G|date=March 2000|title=Biofibres, biodegradable polymers and biocomposites:An overview|url=|journal=Macromolecular Materials and Engineering|volume=276|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chitin has also been used several of medical applications. It has been incorporated as a bone filling material for tissue regeneration, a drug carrier and [[excipient]], and as an antitumor agent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biomaterials: The Intersection of Biology and Materials Science|last=Temenoff|first=J.|last2=Mikos|first2=A|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insertion of foreign materials into the body often triggers an immune response, which can have a variety of positive or negative outcomes depending on the bodies response to the material. Implanting something made from naturally synthesized proteins, such as a keratin based implant, has the potential to be recognized as natural tissue by the body. This can lead either to integration in rare cases where the structure of the implant promotes regrowth of tissue with the implant forming a superstructure or degradation of the implant in which the backbones of the proteins are recognized for cleavage by the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Natural rubber''', also called '''India rubber''' or '''''caoutchouc''''', as initially produced, consists of [[polymer]]s of the [[organic compound]] [[isoprene]], with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water. [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] are two of the leading rubber producers. Forms of [[polyisoprene]] that are used as natural rubbers are classified as [[elastomer]]s.

Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the [[latex]] from the [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] or others. The latex is a sticky, milky [[colloid]] drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called "tapping". The latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing.  In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for marketing.

Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, either alone or in combination with other materials. In most of its useful forms, it has a large [[stretch ratio]] and high [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], and is extremely waterproof.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Heinz-Hermann Greve "Rubber, 2. Natural" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==

=== ''Hevea brasiliensis'' ===
The major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Pará rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''), a member of the [[spurge]] [[Family (biology)|family]], ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]''. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.

=== Congo rubber ===
[[Congo rubber]], formerly a major source of rubber, came from vines in the genus ''[[Landolphia]]'' (''[[Landolphia kirkii|L. kirkii]]'', ''L. heudelotis'', and ''L. owariensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/botany/rubber.htm|title=Rubber and Other Latex Products|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dandelion ===
[[Dandelion]] milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from [[rubber trees]]. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content is low and varies greatly. In [[Nazi Germany]], research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed.&lt;ref name="Heim2002"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1DqS5a5A8JkC}}|title=Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus|last=Heim|first=Susanne|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|year=2002|isbn=978-3892444961|authorlink=Susanne Heim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology]] (IME) in [[Germany]] developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|date=28 October 2013|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[Continental Tire]]s, IME began a pilot facility.

=== Other ===
Many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example [[gutta-percha]] (''[[Palaquium gutta]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ |title=The Gutta Percha Company |first=Bill |last=Burns |work=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chicle]] from ''[[Manilkara]]'' species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (''[[Ficus elastica]]''), Panama rubber tree (''[[Castilla elastica]]''), various spurges (''[[Euphorbia]]'' spp.), [[lettuce]] (''[[Lactuca]]'' species), the related ''[[Scorzonera tau-saghyz]]'', various ''[[Taraxacum]]'' species, including common dandelion (''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'') and Russian dandelion (''[[Taraxacum kok-saghyz]]''), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, [[guayule]] (''Parthenium argentatum''). The term '''gum rubber''' is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the [[Hevea tree|''Hevea'' tree]] comes from the [[Olmec]] culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Rubber was later used by the  [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] cultures – in addition to making balls Aztecs used rubber for other purposes such as making containers and to make textiles waterproof by impregnating them with the latex sap.&lt;ref&gt;Emory Dean Keoke, Kay Marie Porterfield. 2009.

The Devil's Milk: A Social History of Rubber. NYU Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pará rubber tree is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[South America]]. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the ''[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]'' of France in 1736.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Marie de la Condamine |website= bouncing-balls.com |url= http://www.bouncing-balls.com/timeline/people/nr_condamine.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he presented a paper by [[François Fresneau]] to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber's properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; In England, [[Joseph Priestley]], in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off [[pencil]] marks on paper, hence the name "rubber". It slowly made its way around England. In 1764 François Fresnau discovered that [[turpentine]] was a rubber solvent. [[Giovanni Fabbroni]] is credited with the discovery of [[naphtha]] as a rubber solvent in 1779.

South America remained the main source of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a [[Capital punishment|capital offense]], although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, [[Henry Wickham (explorer)|Henry Wickham]] smuggled 70,000 Pará rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to [[Kew Gardens]], England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to [[India]], [[British Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]]), [[Singapore]], and [[British Malaya]]. Malaya (now [[Peninsular Malaysia]]) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.

In the early 1900s, the [[Congo Free State]] in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by [[forced labor]]. King Leopold II's colonial state brutally enforced production quotas. Tactics to enforce the rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-25|title=Atrocities in the Congo Free State|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State&amp;oldid=842894462|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] for more information on the rubber trade in the Congo Free State in the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Liberia]] and [[Nigeria]] started production.

In [[India]], commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as early as 1873 at the [[Calcutta]] Botanical Gardens. The first commercial ''Hevea'' plantations were established at Thattekadu in [[Kerala]] in 1902. In later years the plantation expanded to [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of India. India today is the world's 3rd largest producer and 4th largest consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|title=Natural rubber in India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001100758/http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by [[Henry Nicholas Ridley|Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley]], who served as the first Scientific Director of the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]] from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |title=Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley |last=Cornelius-Takahama |first=Vernon |date=2001 |work=Singapore Infopedia |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504095356/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |archivedate=4 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname "Mad Ridley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysiahistory.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:mad-ridley-and-the-rubber-boom&amp;catid=47:economic-history |title=Mad Ridley and the rubber boom |first1=Dr Loh Wei |last1=Leng |first2=Khor Jin |last2=Keong |date=19 September 2011 |work=Malaysia History |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-World War II ===
[[Charles Goodyear]] developed [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] in 1839, although [[Mesoamerican]]s used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosler | first1 = D. | last2 = Burkett | first2 = S.L. | last3 = Tarkanian | first3 = M.J. | year = 1999 | title = Prehistoric polymers: Rubber processing in ancient Mesoamerica | url = | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5422| pages = 1988–1991 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5422.1988 | pmid=10373117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slack2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Slack|title=Noble obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the race to unlock the greatest industrial secret of the nineteenth century|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CWzeAAAAMAAJ}}|date=7 August 2002|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0786867899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, [[Rubber mat|matting]], flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the [[automotive]] industry. The use of rubber in car [[tire]]s (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber.  [[Gloves]] (medical, household and industrial) and toy [[balloon]]s were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as [[adhesive]]s in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make [[rubber band]]s and pencil [[eraser]]s.

Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant value to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments. While rubber is still used in textile manufacturing, its low tenacity limits its use in lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to [[neoprene]] (polymer of [[chloroprene]]), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, [[spandex]] (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.

==Properties==
[[File:Latex being collected from a tapped rubber tree.jpg|thumb|Rubber latex]]
Rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties. Rubber's stress–strain behavior exhibits the [[Mullins effect]] and the [[Payne effect]] and is often modeled as [[Hyperelastic material|hyperelastic]]. Rubber [[Strain crystallization|strain crystallizes]].

Due to the presence of weakened [[allyl]]ic C-H bonds in each [[repeat unit]], natural rubber is susceptible to [[vulcanisation]] as well as being sensitive to [[ozone cracking]].

The two main [[solvents]] for rubber are [[turpentine]] and [[naphtha]] (petroleum). Because rubber does not dissolve easily, the material is finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion.

An [[ammonia]] solution can be used to prevent the [[flocculation|coagulation]] of raw latex.

Rubber begins to melt at approximately {{Convert|180|C}}.

===Elasticity===
{{main|Rubber elasticity}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
On a microscopic scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear. The restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over more linear ones. For the quantitative treatment see [[ideal chain]], for more examples see [[entropic force]].

Cooling below the [[glass transition temperature]] permits local conformational changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains. "Frozen" rubber's elasticity is low and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] results from small changes of [[Chemical bond|bond]] lengths and angles: this caused the [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], when the American [[Space Shuttle]]'s flattened [[o-ring]]s failed to relax to fill a widening gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = Casing Joint Design | work =  Report - Investigation of the Challenger Accident| publisher = US Government Printing Office| date =| url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRPT-99hrpt1016/pdf/CHRG-101shrg1087-2.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass transition is fast and reversible: the force resumes on heating.

The parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.

[[Vulcanization]] of rubber creates di- and [[polysulfide bonds]] between chains, which limits the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible.

===Malodour===
Raw rubber storage depots and rubber processing can produce malodour that is serious enough to become a source of complaints and protest to those living in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215053437/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial impurities originate during the processing of block rubber. These impurities break down during storage or thermal degradation and produce volatile organic compounds. Examination of these compounds using [[gas chromatography]]/[[mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) and gas chromatography (GC) indicates that they contain sulphur, ammonia, [[alkene]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[ester]]s, hydrogen sulphite, nitrogen, and low molecular weight fatty acids (C2-C5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determination of Chemical Components that Cause Mal-Odor from Natural Rubber|first1=Vipavee P.|last1=Hoven|first2=Kesinee|last2=Rattanakaran|first3=Yasuyuki|last3=Tanaka|date=1 November 2003|journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology|volume=76|issue=5|pages=1128–1144|doi=10.5254/1.3547792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aidic.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/12/30/021.pdf |title=Info |website=www.aidic.it |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When latex concentrate is produced from rubber, sulphuric acid is used for coagulation. This produces malodourous hydrogen sulphide.&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

The industry can mitigate these bad odours with [[scrubber|scrubber systems]].&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

== Chemical makeup ==
[[File:NatVsSynPolyisoprene.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Chemical structure of cis-polyisoprene, the main constituent of natural rubber. Synthetic cis-polyisoprene and natural cis-polyisoprene are derived from different precursors, [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] and [[isoprene]].]]

Latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene – with a [[molecular weight]] of 100,000 to 1,000,000 [[Dalton (unit)|daltons]]. Typically, a small percentage (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials, such as [[proteins]], [[fatty acids]], [[resins]], and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created synthetically, producing what is sometimes referred to as "synthetic natural rubber", but the synthetic and natural routes are different.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Some natural rubber sources, such as [[gutta-percha]], are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a [[structural isomer]] that has similar properties.

Natural rubber is an elastomer and a [[thermoplastic]]. Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a [[thermoset]]. Most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it is degraded but not destroyed.

The final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer, but also on modifiers and fillers, such as [[carbon black]], [[factice]], whiting and others.

===Biosynthesis===
Rubber particles are formed in the [[cytoplasm]] of specialized latex-producing cells called [[laticifer]]s within rubber plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Koyama |editor-first= Tanetoshi |editor2-last= Steinbüchel |editor2-first= Alexander |chapter= Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber and Other Natural Polyisoprenoids |title= Polyisoprenoids |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1a_wAAAAMAAJ|page=73}}|series= Biopolymers |volume= 2 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |date= June 2011 |pages= 73–81 |isbn= 978-3527302215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber particles are surrounded by a single [[phospholipid]] membrane with [[hydrophobic]] tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface of the growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Paterson-Jones |first1= J.C. |last2= Gilliland |first2= M.G. |last3= Van Staden |first3= J. |title= The Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber |journal= Journal of Plant Physiology |volume= 136 |issue= 3 |pages= 257–263 |date= June 1990 |doi= 10.1016/S0176-1617(11)80047-7 |issn= 0176-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (an [[Allyl group|allylic]] compound), which elongates by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Christian |last1=Schulze Gronover |first2=Daniela |last2=Wahler |first3=Dirk |last3=Prufer |editor-last= Magdy |editor-first= Elnashar |date=5 Jul 2011 |title=Biotechnology of Biopolymers |chapter=4.

The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by [[prenyltransferase]], which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Xie |first1= W. |display-authors= 3 |last2= McMahan |first2= C.M. |last3= Distefano |first3= A.J.

The required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the [[mevalonate]] pathway, which derives from [[acetyl-CoA]] in the [[cytosol]].

==Production==
[[File:Rubber trees in Kerala, India.jpg|thumb|Rubber is generally cultivated in large plantations. The image shows a coconut shell used in collecting latex, in plantations in [[Kerala]], India.]]
Close to 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2013, of which approximately 44% was natural. Since the bulk is synthetic, which is derived from petroleum, the price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent, by the prevailing global price of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId=daa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f&amp;comp_stats=comp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |title=Overview of the Causes of Natural Rubber Price Volatility |language= |publisher=En.wlxrubber.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526213107/http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId%3Ddaa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f%26comp_stats%3Dcomp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |title=STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF WORLD RUBBER SITUATION |publisher=International Rubber Study Group |date=Nov 2014 |accessdate=2015-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003724/http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2880010|title=The Impact of the Changes of the World Crude Oil Prices on the Natural Rubber Industry in Malaysia|journal=World Applied Sciences Journal|author=Dr. Aye Aye Khin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia was the main source of natural rubber, accounting for about 94% of output in 2005. The three largest producers, [[Thailand]], Indonesia (2.4 million tons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Listiyorini |first=Eko |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |title=Rubber Exports From Indonesia May Grow 6%–8% Next Year |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104074312/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malaysia, together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production. Natural rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of South America due to the existence of South American leaf [[blight]], and other natural predators.

=== Cultivation ===
Rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees. The economic life period of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years&amp;nbsp;— up to 7 years of immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase.

The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of [[laterite]], lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soils.

The climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are:
* Rainfall of around {{Convert|250|cm}} evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
* Temperature range of about 20 to 34&amp;nbsp;°C, with a monthly mean of 25 to 28&amp;nbsp;°C
* Atmospheric humidity of around 80%
* About 2000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year
* Absence of strong winds

Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These clones yield more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg of dry rubber per hectare per year, under ideal conditions.

=== Collection ===
[[File:Ceylon rubber.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Sri Lanka]] harvesting rubber, circa 1920]]
In places such as Kerala and Sri Lanka where coconuts are in abundance, the half shell of coconut was used as the latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became  more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised "spout" knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily "task" size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian contributions to the world 15,000 years of inventions and innovations|last=Keoke|first=Emory|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usual to tap a pannel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the tree's life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25&amp;nbsp;cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes.

The trees drip latex for about four hours, stopping as latex coagulates naturally on the tapping cut, thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark. Tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work, then start collecting the liquid "field latex" at about midday.

====Field coagula====
[[File:MixedFieldCoagula.jpg|thumb|Mixed field coagula.]]
[[File:SmallholdersLumpAtRemillingFactory.jpg|thumb|Smallholder's lump at a remilling factory]]
The four types of field coagula are "cuplump", "treelace", "smallholders' lump" and "earth scrap". Each has significantly different properties.&lt;ref&gt;This section has been copied almost verbatim from the [[public domain]] UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), ecoport.com article: {{cite web |url= http://ecoport.org/ep?SearchType=earticleView&amp;earticleId=644&amp;page=4363 |title=Processing of Natural Rubber, Manufacture of Latex-Grade Crepe Rubber |first1=John |last1=Cecil |first2=Peter |last2=Mitchell |first3=Per |last3=Diemer |first4=Peter |last4=Griffee |publisher=FAO, Agricultural and Food Engineering Technologies Service |work=ecoport.org |date=2013 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees continue to drip after the collection leading to a small amount of "cup lump" that is collected at the next tapping. The latex that coagulates on the cut is also collected as "tree lace". Tree lace and cup lump together account for 10–20% of the dry rubber produced. Latex that drips onto the ground, "earth scrap", is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product.

===== Cup lump =====
Cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again. It arises from latex clinging to the walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket, and from late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become blocked. It is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three types.

===== Tree lace =====
Tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut before making a new cut. It usually has higher copper and manganese contents than cup lump. Both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can damage the physical properties of the dry rubber.

===== Smallholders' lump =====
Smallholders' lump is produced by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex&amp;nbsp;— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.

===== Earth scrap =====
Earth scrap is material that gathers around the base of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers' buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold to a contractor who cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.

=== Processing ===
[[File:RemovingCoagulumFromCoagulatingTroughs.jpg|thumb|Removing coagulum from coagulating troughs.]]
Latex coagulates in the cups if kept for long and must be collected before this happens. The collected latex, "field latex", is transferred into coagulation tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight containers with sieving for ammoniation. Ammoniation preserves the latex in a colloidal state for longer periods of time.

Latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of dipped goods or coagulated under controlled, clean conditions using formic acid. The coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade, technically specified block rubbers such as SVR 3L or SVR CV or used to produce Ribbed Smoke Sheet grades.

Naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of TSR10 and TSR20 grade rubbers. Processing for these grades is a size reduction and cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final stage of drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Rubber Testing|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VQVAHZyHyPAC|page=6}}|publisher=ASTM International|pages=6–|id=GGKEY:8BT2U3TQN7G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment.

=== Vulcanized rubber ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{Main|Sulfur vulcanization}}
[[File:Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal P8180011.jpg|thumb|Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal]]
Natural rubber is often vulcanized, a process by which the rubber is heated and [[sulfur]], [[peroxide]] or [[bisphenol]] are added to improve resistance and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and to prevent it from perishing. Before World War II, carbon black was often used as an additive to rubber to improve its strength, especially in vehicle tires.

=== Transportation ===
Natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in south-west Asia, South America, and West and Center Africa to destinations around the world. As the cost of natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offering the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404081944/http://www.aalatex.com/content/comments.asp?id=193 Transportation of Natural Rubber] - Industry Source&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vulcanization|Vulcanized rubber]] has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.

The flexibility of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful in the manufacture of articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or [[lacrosse]] balls are made of rubber.

Around 25 million tonnes of rubber are produced each year, of which 30 percent is natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|title=Rubber Faqs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913145725/https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical sources. The top end of latex production results in latex products such as surgeons' gloves, condoms, balloons and other relatively high-value products. The mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts, marine products, windshield wipers and miscellaneous goods. Natural rubber offers good elasticity, while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to environmental factors such as oils, temperature, chemicals and ultraviolet light. "Cured rubber" is rubber that has been compounded and subjected to the vulcanisation process to create cross-links within the rubber matrix.

==Allergic reactions==
{{Main|Latex allergy}}

Some people have a serious [[latex allergy]], and exposure to natural latex rubber products such as [[latex glove]]s can cause [[anaphylactic shock]]. The [[antibody generator|antigenic proteins]] found in ''Hevea'' latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated)&lt;ref name=510k&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Testing for Skin Sensitization To Chemicals In Natural Rubber Products|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073793.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through processing.

Latex from non-''[[Hevea]]'' sources, such as [[Guayule]], can be used without allergic reaction by persons with an allergy to ''Hevea'' latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm048052.htm|title=New Type of Latex Glove Cleared|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself, but from residues of chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process. Although this may be confused with an allergy to latex, it is distinct from it, typically taking the form of [[Type IV hypersensitivity]] in the presence of traces of specific processing chemicals.&lt;ref name=510k /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Latex Allergy Association|title=Allergy Fact Sheet|url=http://www.latexallergyresources.org/allergy-fact-sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''near-Earth supernova''' is an explosion resulting from the  death of a [[star]] that occurs close enough to the [[Earth]] (roughly less than 10 to 300 parsecs (30 to 1000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s) away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What If History’s Brightest Supernova Exploded In Earth’s Backyard? |author=Joshua Sokol |date=Jan 14, 2016 |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/rare-supernova-crab-nebula/424125/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to have noticeable effects on Earth's [[biosphere]].

==Effects on Earth==
On average, a [[supernova]] explosion occurs within {{convert|10|pc|ly|abbr=off}} of the Earth every 240 million years.{{efn|Since a radius of 100 light years contains approximately 27.8 times as much volume as one of 33 light years, a supernova should occur within a radius of 100 light years from Earth approximately once every 8.6 million years.  A supernova would occur within a radius of 200 light years approximately once every million years, within 500 light years every 69,000 years, and within 1,000 light years roughly every 8,625 years.{{Original research inline|date=May 2016}}}} [[Gamma ray]]s are responsible for most of the adverse effects a supernova can have on a living [[terrestrial planet]]. In Earth's case, gamma rays induce a [[chemical reaction]] in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], converting molecular [[nitrogen]] into [[nitrogen oxide]]s, depleting the [[ozone layer]] enough to expose the surface to harmful [[solar radiation|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] (mainly ultra-violet). [[Phytoplankton]] and [[Coral Reef|reef]] communities would be particularly affected, which could severely deplete the base of the marine food chain.&lt;ref name="ellis93"&gt;

==Risk by supernova type==
Speculation as to the effects of a nearby supernova on Earth often focuses on large stars as [[Type II supernova]] candidates. Several prominent stars within a few hundred light years of the Sun are candidates for becoming supernovae in as little as a millennium. Although they would be spectacular to look at, were these "predictable" supernovae to occur, they are thought to have little potential to affect Earth.

It is estimated that a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova closer than eight [[parsec]]s (26&amp;nbsp;light-years) would destroy more than half of the Earth's ozone layer.&lt;ref name=Gehrels&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies assume that supernovae are concentrated in the spiral arms of the galaxy, and that supernova explosions near the Sun usually occur during the ~10 million years that the Sun takes to pass through one of these regions.&lt;ref name=Gehrels/&gt; Examples of relatively near supernovae are the [[Vela Supernova Remnant]] (~800 ly, ~12,000 years ago) and [[Geminga]] (~550 ly, ~300,000 years ago).

[[Type Ia supernova]]e are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because Type&amp;nbsp;Ia supernovae arise from dim, common [[white dwarf]] stars, it is likely that a supernova that could affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and take place in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is [[IK Pegasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A supernova occurring so close would have probably caused a mass extinction, which did not happen in that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Fields &amp; Ellis, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of iron seems to indicate that the supernova was less than 30 parsecs away. On the other hand, the authors estimate the frequency of supernovae at a distance less than ''D'' (for reasonably small ''D'') as around (''D''/10 [[parsec|pc]])&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per [[annum|Ga]], which gives a probability of only around 5% for a supernova within 30 pc in the last 5 million years. They point out that the probability may be higher because the Solar System is entering the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way.

[[Gamma ray burst]]s from "dangerously close" supernova explosions occur two or more times per billion years, and this has been proposed as the cause of the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end Ordovician extinction]], which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 660 ly). If so, this is an unexpected  event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Fields" /&gt;

'''Nicolas Antoine Boulanger''' (11 November 1722, Paris – 16 September 1759, Paris) was a [[France|French]] philosopher and [[man of letters]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Persee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Born the son of a paper merchant in Paris, Boulanger studied first mathematics, and later ancient languages.  He composed several philosophical works in which he sought to come up with naturalistic explanations for superstitions and religious practices, all of which were published posthumously.  His major works were ''Research into the Origins of Oriental Despotism'' («Recherches sur l’origine du despotisme oriental», 1761) and ''Antiquity Unveiled'' («L’Antiquité dévoilée par ses usages», 1766). Boulanger's collected works were published in 1792.

The German-born [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul-Henri Thiry, 1723–1789) published his controversial anti-religious work ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]'' («Christianisme dévoilé», 1761), using Boulanger's name as his pseudonym, just two years after the philosopher's death.&lt;ref name="Room" /&gt; Boulanger also was one of the first modern critics of Paul.&lt;ref name=" Life of St. Paul" /&gt;

== Honours ==
The Koronian asteroid [[7346 Boulanger]], discovered in 1993, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

[[File:Moonfromoakland04052006.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] is the most often viewed major object in the night sky, while sometimes visible during [[daytime]].]]
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|The [[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The term '''night sky''', usually associated with [[astronomy]] from [[Earth]], refers to the [[night]]time appearance of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] like [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Moon]], which are visible in a clear [[sky]] between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], when the [[Sun]] is below the [[horizon]].

Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and [[airglow]], depending on location and timing. [[Aurora]]e light up the skies above the [[polar circle]]s. Occasionally, a large [[coronal mass ejection]] from the Sun or simply high levels of [[solar wind]] may extend the phenomenon toward the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="Northern Lights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yukon |first1=Northwestel |title=Aurora Borealis Explained |url=http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html |publisher=Northern Lights Centre |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, [[farmer]]s have used the status of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to [[agriculture|plant crops]]. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deity|deities]].

The [[history of astrology|anciently developed]] belief of [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The ''scientific'' study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of [[observational astronomy]].



The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by [[light pollution]]. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of [[sky brightness|ambient brightness]]. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. [[Optical filter]]s and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] seek locations far from [[urban area|urban]] [[skyglow]].

== Brightness ==
{{Main|Sky brightness}}

[[File:Starry Night at La Silla.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at [[La Silla Observatory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starry Night at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1333a/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight ([[Rayleigh scattering]]) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]] defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]],  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99238.htm |title=Number of Stars in the Sky |last1=Hawley |work=NEWTON Ask A Scientist |publisher=US Department of Energy |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for [[stereopsis]] to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the [[rod cell]]s without triggering the [[cone cell]]s.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, [[averted vision]] may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because [[stargazing]] is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red [[flashlight]] (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See [[Purkinje effect]]).

=== Constellations ===
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many [[star chart|sky maps]] to aid stargazers in identifying [[constellation]]s and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html |title=Orion |first=Chris |last=Dolan |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Dipper]] (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to [[Polaris]], the north star.

The [[pole star]]s are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
[[Planet]]s, named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "wanderer," process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. [[Venus]] is the most prominent planet, often called the "morning star" or "evening star" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only "star" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are also visible to the naked eye.

=== The Moon ===
Earth's [[Moon]] is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified.  Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of [[lunar phase]]s.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the [[moon illusion]] which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
[[Comet]]s come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a [[great comet]] appears about once a decade.  They tend to be  visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

=== Clouds===
[[Cloud]]s obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects.  A very thin [[cirrus cloud]] in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down.  Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
{{wide image|Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|500px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a very large streak or arc across the night sky if the [[visibility]] conditions are good enough. This [[panoramic]] photo was taken at [[Death Valley]].}}

[[File:Where Heaven and Earth Collide.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: [[Milky Way#Halo|halo]] and [[Disc galaxy|disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Heaven and Earth Collide|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1635a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the [[Milky Way]], a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The [[Magellanic Clouds]] of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].

[[Zodiacal light]] is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial [[satellite]]s often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in [[low Earth orbit]] cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including [[space debris]], appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. [[Satellite flare|Satellite flares]] can appear brighter than [[Venus]], with notable examples including the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium Satellites]].

[[Meteor]]s (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a [[meteor shower]], they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

[[Aircraft]] are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]
In [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.

According to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].

A contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others. It holds that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. Given the [[principle of mediocrity]] (in the same vein as the [[Copernican principle]]), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Requirements for complex life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are "dead zones" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:
# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].
# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimals]] by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[extinction|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.

Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. Lineweaver et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lineweaver |first1=Charles H. |last2=Fenner |first2=Yeshe |last3=Gibson |first3=Brad K. |date=2004 |title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5654 |pages=59–62 |doi=10.1126/science.1092322 |pmid=14704421 |arxiv=astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode=2004Sci...303...59L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712034717/http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, et al.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzalez|Brownlee|Ward|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loveday, J. |date=February 1996 |title=The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1048 |bibcode=1996MNRAS.278.1025L |arxiv=astro-ph/9603040 |doi=10.1093/mnras/278.4.1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms.&lt;ref name="mihalas1968"&gt;{{Cite book |author=D.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibling Rivalry |date=31 March 2012 |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328586.500-milky-way-mysteries-andromeda-our-sibling-rival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Milky Way's central [[black hole]] seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with [[Galactic year|a period of 226 Ma]] (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===
[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]
The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351–7 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103579901416 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper [[metallicity]] and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] variation. To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astro.unl.edu"&gt;[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth’s twins aren’t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05{{cn|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.
These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].

Small [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%&lt;ref name="RECONS1"&gt;[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.&lt;ref name="Ward 2000 15–33"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the right arrangement of planets===
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets. Rare Earth argues that without such an arrangement, in particular the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth planet from the Sun and the largest), complex life on Earth would not have arisen.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070827-jupiter-comets_2.html |first=Anne |last=Minard |date=27 August 2007 |title=Jupiter Both an Impact Source and Shield for Earth |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=without the long, peaceful periods offered by Jupiter's shield, intelligent life on Earth would never have been able to take hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.

Observations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: "The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Batygin et al., pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|chaotic planetary orbits]], especially in a system having [[Jovian planets|large planets]] at high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tobiash/posters/Tobias_final_new.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chaos and Planet-Particle Dynamics within the Habitable Zone of Extrasolar Planetary Systems (A qualitative numerical stability study) |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Hinse |first=T.C. |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |quote=Main simulation results observed: [1] The presence of high-order mean-motion resonances for large values of giant planet eccentricity [2] Chaos dominated dynamics within the habitable zone(s) at large values of giant planet mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for stable orbits rules out [[Extrasolar planet|stars with systems of planets]] that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "[[hot Jupiters]]"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Once you realize that most of the known extrasolar planets have highly eccentric orbits (like the planets in Upsilon Andromedae), you begin to wonder if there might be something special about our solar system" (UCBerkeleyNews quoting Extra solar planetary researcher Eric Ford.) {{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/04/13_planet.shtml |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=13 April 2005 |title=Wayward planet knocks extrasolar planets for a loop |accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Planets of the Solar System to scale. Rare Earth argues that complex life cannot exist on large gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn (top row) or Uranus and Neptune (top middle) or smaller planets such as Mars and Mercury]]
It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee pg 220&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and [[plate tectonics]] may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like [[Venus]]. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462&amp;nbsp;°C; 863&amp;nbsp;°F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lissauer|1999}}, as summarized by {{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|p=92}}; also see {{harvnb|Comins|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With plate tectonics===
[[File:Great American Biotic Interchange examples.svg|thumb|The [[Great American Interchange]] on Earth, around ~ 3.5 to 3 Ma, an example of species competition, resulting from continental plate interaction]]
[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the structure of Earth's magnetic field-magnetosphere that protects Earth's life from [[solar radiation]]. 1)&amp;nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&amp;nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&amp;nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&amp;nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&amp;nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&amp;nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that [[plate tectonics]] and a strong [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] are essential for  [[biodiversity]], [[global temperature regulation]], and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of [[mountain chain]]s elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from [[radioactive decay]]. Continents must be made of less dense [[felsic]] rocks that "float" on underlying denser [[mafic]] rock. Taylor&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; emphasizes that tectonic [[subduction]] zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of [[Biogeochemical cycle|biochemical cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/4076-plate-tectonics-essential-alien-life.html Plate Tectonics Could Be Essential for Alien Life], By Lee Pullen, Astrobiology Magazine, February 19, 2009, SPACE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics and as a result [[continental drift]] and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified [[ecosystem]]s and [[biodiversity]], one of the strongest defences against extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Ward, R. D. &amp; Brownlee, D.}} 2000. ''[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/platelif.html Plate tectonics essential for complex evolution]'' - [[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth]] - [[Copernicus Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the [[Great American Interchange]]. North and Middle America drifted into [[South America]] at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The [[fauna]] of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since [[Antarctica]] separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing [[North America|Northern American]] animals.

===A large moon===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools resulting from tidal interaction of the Moon are said to have promoted the evolution of complex life.]]
The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids ([[Mars]]).

The [[Giant-impact hypothesis|Giant-impact theory]] hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a [[Mars]]-sized body, dubbed [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its [[axial tilt]]  (inclination) and velocity of rotation.&lt;ref name=Taylor98&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes [[photosynthesis]] viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rotation-summer-solstice/ scientificamerican.com, Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer, By Adam Hadhazy, 14 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rare Earth'' hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the [[precession|variation in tilt]] would be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], probably making complex life forms on land impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean [[tide]]s resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to [[tidal pool]]s, which may be essential for the formation of [[macromolecule|complex life]], though this is far from certain.&lt;ref&gt;A formal description of the hypothesis is given in: {{Cite journal |last=Lathe |first=Richard |date=March 2004 |title=Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |quote=tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life. |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018 |bibcode=2004Icar..168...18L |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300383X}} It is taught less formally here: {{Cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec25.html |title=Origin of Life |accessdate=31 October 2007 |first=James |last=Schombert |publisher=University of Oregon |quote=with the vastness of the Earth's oceans it is statistically very improbable that these early proteins would ever link up. The solution is that the huge tides from the Moon produced inland tidal pools, which would fill and evaporate on a regular basis to produce high concentrations of amino acids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] through the effect of [[tidal force]]s on the planet's crust.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the [[continental crust]] would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for [[oceanic crust]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is possible that the large scale [[mantle convection]] needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|right|Earth's atmosphere]]

===Atmosphere===
A terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] thinned [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/27969-earth-water-from-asteroids-not-comets.html Space.com, Most of Earth's Water Came from Asteroids, Not Comets, By Charles Q.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation]]
Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W. &amp; Mentel, M. (2010)[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356# The Origin of Mitochondria. Nature Education] 3(9):58&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution and persistence of [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]] is another mystery in biology. The purpose of [[sexual reproduction]] is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mating type]]s (types of [[gamete]]s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czárán |first1=T.L. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=R.F. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of sexual asymmetry |url=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |issue=|pages=34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34|pmid=15383154 |pmc=524165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolution===
[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] 
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucatán peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.

If there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:
[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]
:&lt;math&gt;N=N^* \cdot n_e \cdot f_g \cdot f_p \cdot f_{pm} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot f_l \cdot f_m \cdot f_j \cdot f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume &lt;math&gt;N^* \cdot n_e=5\cdot10^{11}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and could plausibly be as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latter case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.
* &lt;math&gt;f_g&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets that are rocky ("metallic") rather than gaseous.
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]). Barrow and Tipler&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye–hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;
*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins? Their ability to communicate complex ideas is indisputable. Also, dolphins clearly have culture.|date=August 2016}} than that of any other mammal, enabling [[speech]]. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating [[abstraction]]s to a degree permitting the invention of [[mathematics]], and the discovery of [[science]] and [[technology]]. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb,&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"/&gt; a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book.
* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986. 3.2, 8.7, 9), [[cosmologist]]s, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]], and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.

===Anthropic reasoning===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].

According to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the [[creationist]] ideas of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Kendrick. 'Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?' The Skeptical Inquirer. 1 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exoplanets around main sequence stars are being discovered in large numbers===
{{see also|Estimated frequency of Earth-like planets}}
An increasing number of [[extrasolar planet]] discoveries are being made with {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} planetary systems known as of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems. However, [[Planetary habitability#Red dwarf systems|some exobiologists have suggested]] that stars outside this range may give [[Abiogenesis|rise to life]] under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.&lt;ref name="RECONS1"/&gt;

Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and [[biosignature]]s are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref name="HowardSanchis-Ojeda2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=Andrew W. |display-authors=etal |title=A rocky composition for an Earth-sized exoplanet |journal=Nature |volume=503 |issue=7476 |year=2013 |pages=381–384 |doi=10.1038/nature12767 |pmid=24172898 |arxiv=1310.7988 |bibcode=2013Natur.503..381H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Earth Similarity Index]] (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature provides a means of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925005119/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-11/21/exoplanet-indices |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Gary [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-22/new-recipe-in-search-for-alien-life/3686408/ New approach in search for alien life] ABC Online. 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Rare Earth's estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (&lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive.

Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;), [[tectonics]] must be present to generate [[biogeochemical cycles]], and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and [[orogenic|subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth.

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).&lt;ref&gt;Hartman H, McKay CP "Oxygenic photosynthesis and the oxidation state of Mars." Planet Space Sci. 1995 Jan-Feb;43(1-2):123-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water.&lt;ref name=Choi2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does a Planet Need Life to Create Continents?

====A magnetic field may not be a requirement====
The importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known [[magnetofossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A large moon may neither be rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by [[Edward Belbruno]] and [[J. Richard Gott]] of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the [[Moon]] can indeed form in planetary [[trojan points]] ({{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Belbruno |author2=J.

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Collision between two planetary bodies (artist concept).]]

Rare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Although the [[giant impact theory]] posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "[[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|stolen]]" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee 2000, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nick |first=Hoffman |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-01x1.html |title=The Moon And Plate Tectonics: Why We Are Alone |work=Space Daily |date=11 June 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name="TurnerRushmer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=S. |last2=Rushmer |first2=T. |last3=Reagan |first3=M. |last4=Moyen |first4=J.-F. |title=Heading down early on?

===Complex life may arise in alternative habitats===
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Complex life may exist in environments similar to [[black smoker]]s on Earth.]]
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a [[natural satellite|moon]] of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life.&lt;ref name="Schulze-MakuchIrwin2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |author2=Louis Neal Irwin |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdjoTGAvrkkC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=2 October 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-76816-6 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments.

'''Scotlandite''' is a [[sulfite]] mineral first discovered in a mine at [[Leadhills#Mining|Leadhills]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], an area known to [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] and [[geologist]]s for its wide range of different mineral species found in the veins that lie deep in the mine shafts. This specific mineral is found in the Susanna vein of [[Leadhills]], where the crystals are formed as chisel-shaped or bladed.&lt;ref name=earthwise /&gt; Scotlandite was actually the first naturally occurring [[sulfite]], which has the ideal chemical formula of [[Lead|Pb]][[Sulfur|S]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The mineral has been approved by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, IMA, to be named scotlandite for Scotland.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scotlandite is found in association with [[pyromorphite]], [[anglesite]], [[lanarkite]], [[leadhillite]], [[susannite]], and [[barite]]. It occurs in cavities in massive [[barite]] and [[anglesite]], and is closely associated with [[lanarkite]] and [[susannite]]. Scotlandite represents the latest phase in the crystallization sequence of the associated lead secondary minerals.  It can often be found in the vuggy [[anglesite]] as yellowish single crystals up to 1 millimeter in length that sometimes arrange in a fan-shaped aggregates.  [[Anglesite]] can usually be recognized in a very thin coating on scotlandite which is used to protect the [[sulfite]] from further oxidation.  A second variety of scotlandite can also occur in discontinuously distributed cavities between the [[anglesite]] mass containing the first variety and the [[barite]] matrix. This variety is characterized by tiny, whitish to water-clear crystals, and crystal clusters less than one millimeter in size, which encrust large portions of the interior of the cavities. Scotlandite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scotlandite is a pale yellow, greyish-white, colorless, transparent mineral with an adamantine or pearly luster. It exhibits a hardness of 2 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]].&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scotlandite occurs as chisel-shaped or bladed crystals elongated along the c-axis, with a tendency to form radiating clusters. Its crystals are characterized by the {100}, {010}, {011}, {021}, {031}, and {032}.  [[Miller Index|faces]]. Scotlandite shows perfect cleavage along the {100} plane and a less good one along the {010} plane. The measured density is 6.37 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scotlandite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. The mineral is optically [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], 2V&lt;sub&gt;meas.&lt;/sub&gt; 35° 24'(Na). The refractive indices are: α ~ 2.035, β ~ 2.040, and γ ~ 2.085 (Na). Dispersion is strong, v &gt;&gt; r. The extinction is β//b, and α [001] = 20° (γ [100] = 4° in the obtuse angle β. H(Mohs) &lt; 2. D = 6.37 and calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.40 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;  The [[infrared spectrum]] of scotlandite shows conclusively that it is an anhydrous [[sulfite]], with no OH groups or other polyatomic anions being present. It is also proven by [[electron microprobe]] analysis and [[infrared spectroscopy]] that scotlandite must be a polymorph of lead sulfite.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scotlandite is a [[sulfite]] compared with chemically related compounds, it is very close to the value of [[anglesite]] (6.38 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;), but distinctly different from that of [[lanarkite]] (6.92 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Orthorhombic]] lead sulfite is of higher density (D&lt;sub&gt;meas&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.54, calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.56 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), and has the same chemical properties as well.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The empirical chemical formula for scotlandite calculated on the basis of Pb+S = 2, is Pb&lt;sub&gt;l.06&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.94&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2.94&lt;/sub&gt; or more ideally PbSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
A small crystal of scotlandite, showing some cleavage faces, was examined using Weissenberg and precession techniques. Scotlandite is in the [[monoclinic]] crystal system. The only systematic extinctions observed from the single crystal patterns were 0k0 where k was odd. Thus the possible [[space group]] is either P2 or P2/m. The unit cell parameters obtained from the single crystal study were used to index the X-ray powder pattern and were then refined with the indexed powder data.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The results are: a = 4.505&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]], b = 5.333&amp;nbsp;Å, c = 6.405&amp;nbsp;Å; β= 106.24°; Z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. If the present a and c axes are interchanged, the unit cell of scotlandite is very similar, isotypic, to that of [[molybdomenite]], PbSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Lead is coordinated to nine oxygen atoms with Pb-O&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;=2.75 Å, and possibly further to one sulfur atom with Pb−S=3.46 Å.  The average S−O distance in the pyramidal SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group is 1.52 Å.&lt;ref name=springer /&gt;

[[File:Slate Macro 1.JPG|thumb|A piece of slate (~&amp;nbsp;6 cm long and ~&amp;nbsp;4 cm high)]]
'''Slate''' is a fine-grained, [[foliation (geology)|foliated]],  homogeneous [[metamorphic rock]] derived from an original [[shale]]-type [[sedimentary rock]] composed of [[clay]] or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[ash (volcanic)|ash]] through low-grade regional [[metamorphism]]. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt; Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt;

The foliation in slate is called "[[slaty cleavage]]".&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; When expertly "cut" by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called [[fissility (geology)|fissility]], forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for [[roof]]ing, floor tiles, and other purposes.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].

The word "slate" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. These were  traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or noticeboard, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases "clean slate" and "[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]" come from this usage.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881; page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]] in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920; page 622.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''roof slate'' referred to shale above a coal seam, and ''draw slate'' referred to shale that fell from the mine roof as the coal was removed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marvin Weller, ed.,[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UIrAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;pg=RA1-PA18 Supplement to the Glossary of Geology and Related Sciences], American Geological Institute, 1960; page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mineral composition==
Slate is mainly composed of the minerals [[quartz]] and [[muscovite]] or [[illite]], often along with [[biotite]], [[chlorite group|chlorite]], [[hematite]], and [[pyrite]] and, less frequently [[apatite]], [[graphite]], [[kaolinite]], [[magnetite]], [[tourmaline]], or [[zircon]] as well as [[feldspar]]. Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.

Slate  can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability – cleavage and grain – which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A "slate boom" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the first world war, allowed by the use of the steam engine in manufacturing slate tiles and improvements in road and waterway transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.
Natural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]

Slate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80–100 years. Slate roofs are still used today.

Some mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website "Hook Fixing"]. Retrieved on 26 January 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113747/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp archived]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled
* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used
* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.

The metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.

Slate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.

===Other uses===
Because it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.

Due to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.

In areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].

Slate was traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan. It is now considered to be a luxury.

{{Main|Slate industry}}

===Europe===
Most slate in Europe today [[Slate Industry in Spain|comes from Spain]], the world's largest producer and exporter of natural slate, and 90 percent of Europe's natural slate used for roofing originates from the slate industry there.

Lesser slate-producing regions in Europe include [[Slate industry in Wales|Wales]] (with a [[National Slate Museum|museum at Llanberis]]), [[Cornwall]] (famously the village of [[Delabole]]), [[Cumbria]] (see [[Burlington Slate Quarries]], [[Honister Slate Mine]] and [[Skiddaw Slate]]) and, formerly in the West Highlands of Scotland, around [[Ballachulish]] and the [[Slate Islands]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Parts of [[France]] ([[Anjou]], [[Loire Valley]], [[Ardennes]], [[Brittany]], [[Savoie]]) and [[Belgium]] (Ardennes), [[Liguria]] in northern [[Italy]], especially between the town of [[Lavagna]] (which means ''chalkboard'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) and Fontanabuona valley; [[Portugal]] especially around [[Valongo]] in the north of the country.

[[Germany]]'s [[Moselle River]] region, [[Hunsrück]], [[Eifel]],  [[Westerwald]], [[Thuringia]] and north [[Bavaria]] (with a former mine open as a museum at [[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Fell]]); and [[Alta, Norway]] (actually [[schist]], not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.

===Americas===
Slate is abundant in [[Brazil]], the world's second-biggest producer of slate, around [[Papagaios]] in [[Minas Gerais]], which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate. However, not all "slate" products from Brazil are entitled to bear the [[CE mark]].&lt;ref&gt;Fundación Centro Tecnológico de la Pizarra. Report into the "Technical properties of Bambui Slate from the State of Minas Gerais (Brazil) to ascertain its compliance with the Standard EN12326". [http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf Brazilian Slate Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214213924/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf |date=14 February 2010 }}, retrieved on 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is produced on the east coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in Eastern [[Pennsylvania]],  [[Buckingham Slate|Buckingham County, Virginia]], and the [[Slate Valley]] of [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], where colored slate is mined in the [[Granville (town), New York|Granville, New York]] area.  Pennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys in the U.S.  The tones produced from the slate (when scratched with various species of wood strikers) imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of [[wild turkey]] in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.

A major slating operation existed in [[Monson, Maine]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are still roofed with slate tiles. The roof of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]] was made of Monson slate, as is the headstone of [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm Granville: Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108054330/http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm |date=8 January 2011 }} accessed 23 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is found in the [[Arctic]], and was used by [[Inuit]] to make the blades for [[ulu]]s.

=== Asia ===
China has vast slate deposits; in recent years its export of finished and unfinished slate has increased. It has slate in various colors.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Mintaro Slate Quarry 1880.jpeg|thumb|right|Workers mining slate at Mintaro quarry, c. 1880]]

Deposits of slate exist throughout the Australian continent, with large reserves quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] ([[Willunga, South Australia|Willunga]] and [[Kanmantoo, South Australia|Kanmantoo]]) and the [[Mid North]] ([[Mintaro, South Australia#Slate and Flagstone|Mintaro]] and [[Spalding, South Australia|Spalding]]).

==Fossils==
Because slate was formed in low heat and pressure, compared to a number of other [[metamorphic rock]]s, some [[fossils]] can be found in slate; sometimes even [[microscopic]] remains of delicate organisms can be found in slate.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Video: ''[[David Attenborough]]: Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clou45.jpg |thumb|1820 edition, C. &amp; J. Ollier, London.]]
[[File:Prometheuscover.jpg |thumb|1820 cover of ''Prometheus Unbound'', C. and J. Ollier, London.]]
"'''The Cloud'''" is a major 1820 poem written by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. "The Cloud" was written during late 1819 or early 1820, and submitted for publication on 12 July 1820. The work was published in the 1820 collection ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]], A Lyrical Drama, in Four Acts, With Other Poems'' by [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] in London in August 1820. The work was proof-read by John Gisborne. There were multiple drafts of the poem. The poem consists of six stanzas in [[anapestic]] or antidactylus meter, a foot with two unaccented syllables followed by an accented syllable.

==Analysis==

The cloud is a metaphor for the unending cycle of nature: "I silently laugh at my own cenotaph/ ... I arise and unbuild it again." As with the wind and the leaves in "[[Ode to the West Wind]]", the skylark in "[[To a Skylark]]", and the plant in "The Sensitive Plant", Shelley endows the cloud with sentient traits that personify the forces of nature.

In "The Cloud", Shelley relies on the imagery of transformation or metamorphosis, a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth: "I change, but I cannot die." [[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]] or change is a fact of physical nature.&lt;ref&gt;MacEachen, Dougald B. "CliffsNotes on Shelley's Poems". ''CliffsNotes''. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lightning]] or [[electricity]] is the "pilot" or guide for the cloud. Lightning is attracted to the "[[Jinn|genii]]" in the earth which results in lightning flashes. The genii symbolize the positive charge of the surface of the earth while the cloud possesses a negative charge.

British scientist and poet [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], had written about plant life and science in the poem collection ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1791) and on "spontaneous vitality", that "microscopic animals are said to remain dead for many days or weeks ... and quickly to recover life and motion" when water and heat are added, in ''The Temple of Nature'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Darwin/an01.html ''The Temple of Nature'' By Erasmus Darwin. {1} ADDITIONAL NOTES. SPONTANEOUS VITALITY OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS. Hence without parent by spontaneous birth/Rise the first specks of animated earth. CANTO I. l. 227.]&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Bysshe Shelley had cited Darwin in his Preface to the anonymously published novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818), explaining how the novel was written and its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198127482.book.1/actrade-9780198127482-work-17 Preface to ''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1279684 | pmid=11983772 | volume=95 | title=The real Doctor Frankenstein? | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=257–9 | last1 = Goulding | first1 = C | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that imparting life to a corpse "as not of impossible occurrence".

The cloud is a personification and a metaphor for the perpetual cycle of transformation and change in nature. All life and matter are interconnected and undergo unending change and metamorphosis.

==Reception==

A review of the 1820 ''Prometheus Unbound'' collection in the September and October 1821 issues of ''The London Magazine'' noted the originality of "The Cloud": "It is impossible to peruse them without admiring the peculiar property of the author's mind, which can doff in an instant the cumbersome garments of metaphysical speculations, and throw itself naked as it were into the arms of nature and humanity. The beautiful and singularly original poem of 'The Cloud' will evince proofs of our opinion, and show the extreme force and freshness with which the writer can impregnate his poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 1821 issue of ''Quarterly Review'', W.S. Walker argued that "The Cloud" is related to ''Prometheus Unbound'' in that they are both absurd and "galimatias".&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Todhunter wrote in 1880 that "The Cloud" and "To a Skylark" were "the two most popular of Shelley's lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;Todhunter 1880 pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Francis Thompson asserted that "The Cloud" was the "most typically Shelleyan of all the poems" because it contained "the child's faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power" and that "He is still at play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch, and his playthings are those which the gods give their children. The universe is his box of toys. He dabbles his fingers in the dayfall. He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 1909 qtd. p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919 movie==
On 20 April 1919, a silent black and white movie was released in the US entitled ''The Cloud'' which was "a visual poem featuring clouds and landscapes in accompaniment to the words of Shelley's poem 'The Cloud'." The film was directed by W.A. Van Scoy and produced by the Post Nature Pictures company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010012/ IMDB link to ''The Cloud'' (1919).]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light''''' is a 2013 non-fiction book by Paul Bogard on the gradual disappearance, due to [[light pollution]], of true [[darkness]] from the [[night sky|night skies]] of most people on the planet. Bogard examines the effects of this loss on human physical and mental health, society, and ecosystems, and how it might be mitigated.&lt;ref name="bogard-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogard|first1=Paul|title=The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light|date=July 9, 2013|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=9780316182904|url=http://www.paul-bogard.com/books-and-writings/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="bogard-web-about"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Bogard's book is structured into nine chapters, roughly corresponding to the nine levels of the [[Bortle scale]], which attempts to quantify the subjective [[brightness]] and suitability for [[astronomy]] of the sky in different environments. On his use of the scale, which was invented in 2001, Bogard has said, "one of the reasons why identifying different depths of darkness is so important is that we don’t recognize that we’re losing it, unless we have a name to recognize it by."&lt;ref name="twilley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Twilley|first1=Nicola|first2=Geoff|last2=Manaugh|title=In Search of Darkness: An Interview with Paul Bogard|url=http://v-e-n-u-e.com/In-Search-of-Darkness-An-Interview-with-Paul-Bogard|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Venue|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogard begins at a Bortle level 9 environment, by the [[Luxor Sky Beam]], the brightest spotlight on Earth, located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. He explores the nighttime landscapes of [[London]] and [[Paris]], and examines the planning, or lack thereof, in each city's lighting. He visits locations throughout the continental US, as well as [[Florence]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the isle of [[Sark]], in his quest to understand the nature of light pollution. He experiences firsthand the deleterious effects of night [[shift work]], talks with a former prison inmate about the psychological effects of uninterrupted light, and shares his own [[fear of the dark]].&lt;ref name="bogard-book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vickers"/&gt; Bogard ultimately finds a Bortle level 1 environment: an environment so perfectly free of stray light that the [[Milky Way]] casts noticeable shadows.&lt;ref name="twilley"/&gt;

Bogard argues against the long-held assumption of a correlation between bright light and reduced crime, citing research that finds no such link. Rather than suggesting a return to the completely unlit nights of centuries past, however, he argues for a careful consideration of where and how light is deployed, in order to provide sufficient nighttime illumination for safety, without creating [[glare (vision)|glare]] and other unwanted effects.&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cross|first1=Stephanie|title=The End Of Night by Paul Bogard, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/10213692/The-End-Of-Night-by-Paul-Bogard-review.html|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' reviewer Stephanie Cross wrote that "the appeal of Bogard’s book derives not just from his often wide-eyed enthusiasm for his subject, but also from the constellation of characters he encounters on his journeys into the night."&lt;ref name="cross"/&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', novelist [[Salley Vickers]] wrote that "Bogard sets about his investigations with an energetic purposiveness and enterprise," but complained that "the book comes to seem a little thin, moving too rapidly from one chatty anecdotal meeting to another."&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vickers|first1=Salley|authorlink=Salley Vickers|title=The End of Night by Paul Bogard – review: Would less artificial light be better for us all?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/14/end-night-paul-bogard-review|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' questioned Bogard's statements on the relationship between light and safety, and concluded ambivalently: "''The End of Night'' delivers a forceful, if incomplete, critique of our overexposed world."&lt;ref name="Ekirch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ekirch|first1=A.

'''Vacuum consolidation''' (or vacuum preloading) is a soft soil improvement method that has been successfully used by [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical]] engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies in countries such as Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for [[soil]] improvement or [[land reclamation]] (Chu et al., 2005).  It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required.  However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system.  The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas.  Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum.  It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.

P. | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 857–863|bibcode = 1946JAP....17..857W }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''discomposition effect''' or '''Wigner's Disease''',&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard; (1995); "Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb"; Simon &amp; Schuster; pg 277.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[dislocation]] of [[atom]]s in a solid caused by [[neutron radiation]]. 

Any solid can display the Wigner effect. The effect is of most concern in [[neutron moderator]]s, such as [[graphite]], intended to reduce the speed of [[Neutron temperature#Fast|fast neutrons]], thereby turning them into [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving [[uranium-235]].

== Explanation ==
To create the Wigner effect, [[neutron]]s that collide with the atoms in a [[crystal structure]] must have enough [[energy]] to displace them from the lattice. This amount ([[threshold displacement energy]]) is approximately 25 [[Electronvolt|eV]]. A neutron's energy can vary widely, but it is not uncommon to have energies up to and exceeding 10 MeV (10,000,000 eV) in the centre of a [[nuclear reactor]]. A neutron with a significant amount of energy will create a [[Collision cascade|displacement cascade]] in a matrix via [[elastic collision]]s. For example, a 1 MeV neutron striking [[graphite]] will create 900 displacements; not all displacements will create defects, because some of the struck atoms will find and fill the vacancies that were either small pre-existing voids or vacancies newly formed by the other struck atoms.

The atoms that do not find a [[vacancy defect|vacancy]] come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the symmetrical lines of the lattice. These atoms are referred to as [[interstitial defect|interstitial atoms]], or simply interstitials. An interstitial atom and its associated vacancy are known as a [[Frenkel defect]]. Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball at the top of a hill has [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]]. This energy is referred to as [[Wigner energy]]. When a large number of [[interstitial defect|interstitials]] have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the [[Windscale fire]]. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this.&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1521_web.pdf Characterization, Treatment and Conditioning of Radioactive Graphite from Decommissioning of Nuclear Reactors] (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750&amp;nbsp;°C (6780&amp;nbsp;°F).

Despite some reports,&lt;ref&gt;Workshop on Short-Term Health Effects of Reactor Accidents: Chernobyl, August 8–9, 1986
V.P. Bond and E.P. Cronkite, Editors　[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6905797-IIYHeP/6905797.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy buildup had nothing to do with the cause of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]: this reactor, like all contemporary power reactors, operated at a high enough temperature to allow the displaced graphite structure to realign itself before any potential energy could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-meltdown-no-graphite-us-nuclear-reactors-2016-4&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy may have played some part following the [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]] neutron spike, when the accident entered the graphite fire phase of events.

== Dissipation of Wigner energy ==
A buildup of Wigner energy can be relieved by heating the material. This process is known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. In graphite this occurs at 250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/w/wigner-energy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intimate Frenkel pairs ==
In 2003, it was postulated that Wigner energy can be stored by the formation of metastable defect structures in graphite. Notably, the large energy release observed at 200–250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] has been described in terms of a metastable interstitial-vacancy pair.&lt;ref&gt;Metastable Frenkel Pair Defect in Graphite: Source of Wigner Energy? C. P. Ewels, R. H. Telling, A. A. El-Barbary, M. I. Heggie, and P. R. Briddon Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 025505 – Published 10 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The interstitial atom becomes trapped on the lip of the vacancy, and there is a barrier for it to recombine to give perfect graphite.

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning. In China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhihua|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Chang|first3=Yu|last4=Weisberg|first4=Peter J.|last5=He|first5=Hong S.|date=June 2012|title=Spatial patterns and drivers of fire occurrence and its future trend under climate change in a boreal forest of Northeast China|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=2041–2056|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02649.x|issn=1354-1013|bibcode=2012GCBio..18.2041L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Rigo|first=Daniele|last2=Libertà|first2=Giorgio|last3=Houston Durrant|first3=Tracy|last4=Artés Vivancos|first4=Tomàs|last5=San-Miguel-Ayanz|first5=Jesús|title=Forest fire danger extremes in Europe under climate change: variability and uncertainty|page=71|date=2017|publisher=Publication Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-77046-3|doi=10.2760/13180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="Krock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|title=The World on Fire|last=Krock|first=Lexi|date=June 2002|publisher=NOVA online – Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=13 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027041902/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|archivedate=27 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balch|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Bradley|first2=Bethany A.|last3=Abatzoglou|first3=John T.|last4=Nagy|first4=R.

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by [[topography]], as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: 
* '''Ground''' fires are fed by subterranean roots, [[forest floor|duff]] and other buried [[organic matter]]. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as [[Peat#Peat Fires|peat fires]] in [[Kalimantan]] and Eastern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], which resulted from a [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|riceland creation project]] that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | title = Asian peat fires add to warming | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News | last = Rincon | first = Paul | date = 9 March 2005 | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219064000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crawling''' or '''surface''' fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation on the [[forest floor]] such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al'' ., iv, 10, 14&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires (less than {{convert|400|C|F}}) and may spread at slow rate, though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire on earth : an introduction|last=C.|first=Scott, Andrew|others=Bowman, D.

* '''Ladder''' fires consume material between low-level vegetation and tree canopies, such as small trees, downed logs, and [[vine]]s. [[Kudzu]], [[Old World climbing fern]], and other [[invasive plant]]s that scale trees may also encourage ladder fires.&lt;ref name="FireInitiative"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tncfire.org/crosscutting_fandi.htm | title = Global Fire Initiative: Fire and Invasives | publisher = The Nature Conservancy | accessdate = 3 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090412054533/http://www.tncfire.org/crosscutting_fandi.htm | archivedate = 12 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crown''', '''canopy''', or '''aerial''' fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a crown fire, termed ''crowning'', is dependent on the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv, 8, 11, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the [[Amazon rain forest]], damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|title=Global Commodities Boom Fuels New Assault on Amazon|last=Butler|first=Rhett|publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|accessdate=9 July 2009|date=19 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411124535/http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|archivedate=11 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a [[fire triangle]] come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as [[vegetation]], that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its [[fire point]].&lt;ref name = FireBehavior/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|title=The Science of Wildland fire|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=21 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105175208/http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|archivedate=5 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater [[humidity]], and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., 12"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants continuously lose water by [[evapotranspiration]], but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | title = Ashes cover areas hit by Southern Calif. fires | agency = Associated Press | publisher = MSNBC | date = 15 November 2008 | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033149/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | archivedate = 9 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.&lt;ref name=Structure&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | title = Influence of Forest Structure on Wildfire Behavior and the Severity of Its Effects | date = November 2003 | format = PDF | publisher = US Forest Service | accessdate = 19 November 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125731/http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | archivedate = 17 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | title = Prepare for a Wildfire | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) | accessdate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025706/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wildfire ''front'' is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the [[smolder]]ing transition between unburned and burned material.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation]]. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of {{convert|100|C|F}}. Next, the [[pyrolysis]] of wood at {{convert|230|C|F|sigfig=2}} releases flammable gases.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.&lt;ref name=NOVA /&gt; Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[veld]] in southern Africa, the [[fynbos]] in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

High-severity wildfire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the [[chaparral]] in [[southern California]] and lower-elevation deserts in the American Southwest. The increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent areas has upset natural cycles, damaged native plant communities, and encouraged the growth of non-native weeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy'', 3, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seki/pdfs/Future%20of%20California%20Floristics%20and%20Systematics%20Wildfire%20Th.pdf | format = PDF | title = Future of California floristics and systematics: wildfire threats to the California flora | author = Keeley, J.E. | journal = Madrono | volume = 42 | pages = 175–179 | date = 1995 | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090507033351/http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seki/pdfs/Future%20of%20California%20Floristics%20and%20Systematics%20Wildfire%20Th.pdf | archivedate = 7 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Zedler | first = P.H. | title = Fire frequency in southern California shrublands: biological effects and management options | date = 1995 | booktitle = Brushfires in California wildlands: ecology and resource management | editor = Keeley, J.E. | editor2 = Scott, T. | pages = 101–112 | place = Fairfield, WA | publisher = International Association of Wildland Fire}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invasive species]], such as ''[[Lygodium microphyllum]]'' and ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires.

{{Main|Fire adaptations}}
Plants in wildfire-prone [[ecosystems]] often survive through adaptations to their local [[fire regime]]. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | title=Section Three: Problems, Cares, Economics, and Species | work=The Eucalyptus of California | first=Robert L. | last=Santos | publisher=California State University | date=1997 | accessdate=26 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | archivedate=2 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fire.

Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons{{clarify|does this mean annual dry seasons or erratic droughts?|date=October 2015}} are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous [[progymnosperm]] forests.  [[Lepidodendron]] forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires. In Jurassic [[gymnosperm]] forests, there is evidence of high frequency, light surface fires.&lt;ref name="Pausas 594" /&gt; The increase of fire activity in the late [[Tertiary]]&lt;ref name="cenozoic-division"&gt;Historically, the [[Cenozoic]] has been divided up into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] sub-eras, as well as the [[Neogene]] and [[Paleogene]] periods.

The human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes. Woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel, hunting, seed-gathering and planting.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 597&lt;/ref&gt; In recorded human history, minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the [[Bible]] and by classical writers such as [[Homer]]. However, while ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Roman writers were aware of fires, they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred.&lt;ref name=RackhamFire&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/ALN/aln54/rackham.html#hist|title=Fire in the European Mediterranean: History|last=Rackham|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Rackham|accessdate=17 July 2009|journal=AridLands Newsletter|volume=54|date=November–December 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011110940/http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/ALN/aln54/rackham.html#hist|archivedate=11 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RackhamHist&gt;Rackham, 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as [[early thermal weapons]]. From the [[Middle ages]], accounts were written of [[occupational burning]] as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire. In Germany, regular burning was documented in 1290 in the [[Odenwald]] and in 1344 in the [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name="Goldammer" /&gt; In the 14th century [[Sardinia]], firebreaks were used for wildfire protection.

Scottish botanist [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]] noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers.

Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related [[debris flow]] in [[alluvial fan]]s of northeastern [[Yellowstone National Park]] was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the [[Medieval Warm Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G.A. |last2=Wells |first2=S.G.|last3=Jull|first3=A.J.T.|date=1995|title=Fire and alluvial chronology in Yellowstone National Park: Climatic and intrinsic controls on Holocene geomorphic processes|journal=GSA Bulletin|issue=10|pages=1211–1230 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107&lt;1211:FAACIY&gt;2.3.CO;2 |volume= 107 |bibcode = 1995GSAB..107.1211M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. [[Dendrochronological]] fire scar data and charcoal layer data in [[Finland]] suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pitkänen, ''et al.'', 15–16 and 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n10/full/ngeo313.html |title=Climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=697–702 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo313 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..697M |author=J.

According to a paper published in [[Science (journal)|Science]], the number of natural and human-caused fires decreased by 24.3% between 1998 and 2015. Researchers explain this a transition from [[nomadism]] to settled lifestyle and intensification of [[agriculture]] that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|title= Researchers Detect a Global Drop in Fires|author= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= June 30, 2017|website= [[NASA Earth Observatory]]|publisher= |access-date= July 4, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175626/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|archivedate= 8 December 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Andela|first1= N.|last2= Morton|first2= D.C.|display-authors= etal|date= June 30, 2017|title= A human-driven decline in global burned area|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 356|issue= 6345|pages= 1356–1362|doi= 10.1126/science.aal4108|pmid= 28663495|pmc= 6047075|access-date= July 4, 2017|bibcode= 2017Sci...356.1356A|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702220009/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|archivedate= 2 July 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. [[conifers]]) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in [[monoculture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-biodiversity-criticism-sweden-forest-industry.html Fires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/(httpNews)/531DAFFB8B319F69C125792E00499ED1 The Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[invasive species]], moved in by humans (i.e., for the [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industry]]) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as [[Eucalyptus]] in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.sc.us/forest/scplants.pdf Plant flammability list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firesafemarin.org/plants/fire-prone Fire-prone plant list]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gamba grass]] in Australia.

However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the [[incident commander|fire manager]]. During the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], a data station was established in [[West Yellowstone]], permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.&lt;ref name = Integration/&gt;

Currently, public hotlines, [[fire lookout]]s in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by [[asthenopia|operator fatigue]], time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data analyses.

in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) which uses data from the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.

In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.

The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.

[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]
Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. [[Silver iodide]] can be used to encourage snow fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |title=China Makes Snow to Extinguish Forest Fire |publisher=FOXNews.com |accessdate=10 July 2009 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173448/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[fire retardant]]s and water can be dropped onto fires by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[airtanker|planes]], and [[helitack|helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP//projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2009 |title=Disaster Management Applications – Fire |first=Vincent G. |last=Ambrosia |publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center |date=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081427/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP/projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucinski, ''et al.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of {{convert|54500|km2|acre|sigfig=2|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |title=Fighting fire in the forest |publisher=CBS News |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212242/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | title = Climate of 2008 Wildfire Season Summary | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | date = 11 December 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023095354/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 – Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.&lt;ref name="homeslost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 – Land &amp; Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildland firefighting safety ===
[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]
Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref name=niosh-blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot Tips from NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000&amp;ndash;2016, more than 350&amp;nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC - Fighting Wildfires - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=May 31, 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000-2016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt; Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

==Fire retardant==
Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Agueda |author2=E. Pastor |author3=E. Planas |year=2008|title=Different scales for studying the effectiveness of long-term forest fire retardants|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=782–796|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.   In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magill, B.|title=Officials: Fire slurry poses little threat|work=Coloradoan.com|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20120706/NEWS01/307060035/Officials-Fire-slurry-poses-little-threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers.  Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boerner, C. |author2=Coday B. |author3=Noble, J. |author4=Roa, P. |author5=Roux V. |author6=Rucker K. |author7=Wing, A. |year=2012 |title=Impact of wildfire in Clear Creek Watershed of the city of Golden's drinking water supply |publisher=Colorado School of Mines |url=http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021046/http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt; Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eichenseher, T.|year=2012|title=Colorado Wildfires Threaten Water Supplies|work=National Geographic Daily News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084010/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt;

Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).  After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.&lt;ref&gt;G.D.

However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.&lt;ref name="Alvarado, et al., 66-68"&gt;Alvarado, ''et al''., 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human risk and exposure==
{{wide image|2009 California Wildfires at JPL - Pasadena, California.jpg|933px|2009 California Wildfires at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA/JPL]] – Pasadena, California}}

Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oregon State University|title=About Oregon wildfire risk|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218072405/http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |title=The National Wildfire Mitigation Programs Database: State, County, and Local Efforts to Reduce Wildfire Risk |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907045339/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health.

===Airborne hazards===
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.

Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|year=2008|title=Wildfire smoke: A guide for public health officials|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071549/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildlife Coordination Group|year=2001|title=Smoke management guide for prescribed and wildland fire|location=Boise, ID|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011200515/http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt; Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.

The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) developed the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2009|title=Air quality index: A guide to air quality and health|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507130507/http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire risks===
After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into [[ash pit]]s.

=== At-Risk Groups ===

==== Firefighters====
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296–305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; [[Occupational injury|slips, trips, and falls]]; injuries from vehicle rollovers; [[Heat illness|heat-related illness]]; [[insect bites and stings]]; [[Occupational stress|stress]]; and [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy (2013–158)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154309/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013158|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Residents ====
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov" /&gt;

==== Fetal exposure ====
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes.  In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas.  This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=1&amp;SID=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&amp;page=2&amp;doc=16{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/15/emph.eov027.abstract?papetoc|title = Effects of wildfire disaster exposure on male birth weight in an Australian population.|last = O'Donnell|first = M H|date = November 15, 2015|journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health|doi = 10.1093/emph/eov027|pmid = 26574560|access-date = January 27, 2016|last2 = Behie|first2 = A M|volume = 2015|issue = 1|issn = 2050-6201|pages = 344–354|pmc = 4697771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia Coco|last2=Wilson|first2=Ander|last3=Mickley|first3=Loretta J.|last4=Dominici|first4=Francesca|last5=Ebisu|first5=Keita|last6=Wang|first6=Yun|last7=Sulprizio|first7=Melissa P.|last8=Peng|first8=Roger D.|last9=Yue|first9=Xu|date=January 2017|title=Wildfire-specific Fine Particulate Matter and Risk of Hospital Admissions in Urban and Rural Counties|journal=Epidemiology|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1097/ede.0000000000000556|issn=1044-3983|pmc=5130603|pmid=27648592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[water vapor]], [[particulate matter]], organic chemicals, [[Nitrogen oxide|nitrogen oxides]] and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |title=1 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110731/http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=June 2018|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In asthma patients, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2011.07.001 |title=Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Guide for the Nurse Practitioner |date=2012 |last1=Forsberg |first1=Nicole T. |last2=Longo |first2=Bernadette M. |last3=Baxter |first3=Kimberly |last4=Boutté |first4=Marie |journal=[[The Journal for Nurse Practitioners]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with [[asthma]] related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]], such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Colleen E.|last2=Brauer|first2=Michael|last3=Johnston|first3=Fay H.|last4=Jerrett|first4=Michael|last5=Balmes|first5=John R.|last6=Elliott|first6=Catherine T.|date=2016-04-15|title=Critical Review of Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke Exposure|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1334–43|doi=10.1289/ehp.1409277|issn=0091-6765|pmc=5010409|pmid=27082891}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More specifically, some people with [[asthma]] reported higher use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] (inhalers).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Carbon monoxide danger ===
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt;  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990–2006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include [[Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, and [[Phobia|phobias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21957753 |date=2011 |last1=Papanikolaou |first1=V |last2=Adamis |first2=D |last3=Mellon |first3=RC |last4=Prodromitis |first4=G |title=Psychological distress following wildfires disaster in a rural part of Greece: A case-control population-based study |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20411 |title=Locus of control and psychopathology in relation to levels of trauma and loss: Self-reports of Peloponnesian wildfire survivors |date=2009 |last1=Mellon |first1=Robert C. |last2=Papanikolau |first2=Vasiliki |last3=Prodromitis |first3=Gerasimos |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=189–96 |pmid=19452533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.4.509 |title=Psychiatric Disorders Among Adults Seeking Emergency Disaster Assistance After a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire |date=2007 |last1=Marshall |first1=G.

In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Wildfire: Radiation Raises Slight Concern As Blaze Hits Former Uranium, Gold Mines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Jessica|last=Leader|date=21 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021734/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
The western US has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM) Standards|date=April 24, 2016|publisher=EPA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125540/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.11.030 |title=Wildfire smoke and respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |date=2005 |last1=Sutherland |first1=E.

Children participating in the Children's Health Study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use and physician visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1164/rccm.200604-519OC |title=Health Effects of the 2003 Southern California Wildfires on Children |date=2006 |last1=Kunzli |first1=N. |last2=Avol |first2=E. |last3=Wu |first3=J. |last4=Gauderman |first4=W.

Suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104515 |title=Birth Weight Following Pregnancy During the 2003 Southern California Wildfires |date=2012 |last1=Holstius |first1=David M. |last2=Reid |first2=Colleen E. |last3=Jesdale |first3=Bill M. |last4=Morello-Frosch |first4=Rachel |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=120 |issue=9 |pages=1340–5 |pmid=22645279 |pmc=3440113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide it is estimated that 339,000 people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Fay H.|display-authors=etal|title=Estimated global mortality attributable to smoke from landscape fires|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2012|url=http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/vfe/Landscape-Fire-Smoke-Global-Mortality-Johnston-2012.pdf|volume=120|issue=5|pages=695–701|doi=10.1289/ehp.1104422|pmc=3346787|pmid=22456494|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522061115/http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/vfe/Landscape-Fire-Smoke-Global-Mortality-Johnston-2012.pdf|archivedate=22 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels.
