      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8938">In [[linguistics]], '''backchannels''' are listener responses at a point in time of a conversation where another person is the primary speaker. Backchannels can be both [[Language|verbal]] and [[non-verbal]] in nature, and are frequently [[phatic expression]]s, primarily serving a social or meta-conversational purpose, rather than involving substantial two-way communication.

== Definition and Use ==
The term was coined by [[Victor Yngve]] in 1970, in the following passage: "In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening.  This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn."&lt;ref&gt;Yngve, Victor. "On getting a word in edgewise," page 568. Papers from the Sixth Regional Meeting [of the] Chicago Linguistic Society, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "backchannel" was designed to imply that there are two channels of [[communication]] operating simultaneously during a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;White, Sheida. "Backchannels across cultures: A study of Americans and Japanese ." Language in society (1989): 59-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant channel is that of the speaker who directs primary speech flow. The secondary channel of communication (or backchannel) is that of the listener which functions to provide ''continuers'' or ''assessments'',&lt;ref&gt;Li, Han. "Patterns of Backchannel Responses in Canadian-Chinese Conversations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 23, 2007 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-02-04 &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p169308_index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; defining a listener's comprehension and/or interest. Recent research, which can be seen below, has also suggested new terms for these two functions. They have proposed the term ''generic'' in place of ''continuers'' and ''specific'' in place of ''assessments''.

=== Applicability ===
Backchannel communication is present in all cultures and languages, though frequency and use may vary. Confusion or distraction can occur during an [[intercultural communication|intercultural]] encounter if participants from both parties are not accustomed to the same backchannel norms.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Nigel G. and Yaffa Al Bayyari. "American and Arab Perceptions of an Arabic Turn-Taking Cue." Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (2010): 270-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Backchannels ==
Due to research development in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iwasaki|first=S.|date=1997|title=The Northridge earthquake conversations: The floor structure and the ‘loop’ sequence in Japanese conversation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216697000702|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=28(6)|pages=661-693|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English corpus linguistics: studies in honour of Jan Svartvik|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|publisher=Longman|year=1991|isbn=|editor-last=Aijmer|editor-first=Karin|location=London|pages=254-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  backchannel responses have been expanded to include sentence completions, requests for clarification, brief statements, and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-[[Word|lexical]], phrasal, and substantive.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Richard F. and Jina Lee. "Identifying units in interaction: Reactive tokens in Korean and English conversations." Journal of Sociolinguistics (2004): 380-407.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Non-Lexical Backchannels ===
A non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that has little or no referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention, and that frequently co-occurs with gestures. In [[English language|English]], sounds like ''uh-huh'' and ''hmm'' serve this role. Non-lexical backchannels generally come from a limited set of sounds not otherwise widely used in contentful conversational speech; as a result, they can be used to express support, surprise, or a need for clarification at the same time as someone else's conversational turn without causing confusion or interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Nigel|date=2006|title=Non-lexical conversational sounds in American English|url=|journal=Pragmatics &amp; Cognition|volume=14(1)|pages=129-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English allows for the [[reduplication]], or repetition, of syllables within a non-lexical backchannel, such as in responses like ''uh-huh'', ''mm-hm'', or ''um-hm'', as well as for single-syllable backchanneling. In a study examining the use of two-syllable backchannels that focused on ''mm'' and ''mm-hm'', Gardner found that the two tokens are generally not identical in function, with ''mm'' being used more productively as a continuer, a weak acknowledgment token, and a weak assessment marker. In contrast, ''mm-hm'' is generally used as a backchannel to signal that the speaker is yielding their conversational turn and allowing the other speaker to maintain control of the conversational floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Rod|date=1997|title=The Conversation Object Mm: A Weak and Variable Acknowledging Token|url=|journal=Research on Language and Social Interaction|volume=30(2)|pages=131-156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phrasal &amp; Substantive Backchannels ===
Phrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, "Really?" or "Wow!" in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]] by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions.

One of the conversational functions of phrasal backchannels is to assess or appraise a previous utterance. Goodwin argues that this is the case for the phrasal backchannel ''oh wow'', where use of the backchannel requires a specific conversational context where something unexpected or surprising was said. Similarly, more substantive backchannels such as ''oh come on, are you serious?'' require a context where the speaker is responding to something exasperating or frustrating. In both of these cases, Goodwin argues that the backchannels focus only on addressing some aspect of the immediately proceeding utterance rather than the larger conversation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Between and within: Alternative sequential treatments of continuers and assessments|url=|journal=Human Studies|volume=9|pages=205-217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they have a broad conversational distribution, appearing both in the middle of extended talk as well as at the end of longer conversational turns.

== Recent Research ==
More recent research has pushed back on the notion of backchannels, in which the listener's role is merely to receive information provided by the speaker. Bavelas, Coates, and Johnson&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelas|first=Janet B.|last2=Coates|first2=Linda|last3=Johnson|first3=Trudy|date=2000|title=Listeners as Co-Narrators|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79|pages=941-952|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forth evidence that listeners' responses help shape the content of the speaker. They grouped acknowledgment tokens into two categories: generic and specific. Generic responses could be considered back channels and would include ''mm hm'' and ''yeah'', while specific responses would involve a reaction to the given context. Examples might include ''Oh!'' or a facial display of concern.

They transcribed students telling a fellow participant about a close call experience that they had had. With one group of participants, they had the listener perform another task to distract them from the story being told. The researchers asked independent reviewers to code the verbal and visual responses of the narration events as generic or specific. They also asked other independent reviewers to gauge the quality of the narration in each case.

They concluded that the responses from the distracted listeners included significantly fewer specific responses than from the undistracted listeners. In addition, they found that the quality of the narration was dramatically lower when the listener was distracted. Their basic contention was that listeners are co-narrators and help the storyteller in his or her narration. In other words, a storyteller tells a better story with an audience that is engaged than one that is not.

Tolins and Foxtree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolins|first=Jackson|last2=Fox Tree|first2=Jean E.|date=2014|title=Addressee backchannels steer narrative development|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=70|pages=152-164|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also published research demonstrating how backchannel communication influences speakers. Their research was specifically looking at how speakers respond to generic responses compared to specific responses.

'''Best Enemies''' is an education resource and film created by Ross and Darren Bark that discusses the cyber bullying problem in Australian schools, and explores how to tackle it and help students become pro-active in reporting and stopping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/bully-victims-urged-to-tell-tales-online-20090620-crwh.html|title=Bully victims urged to tell tales online |last=Browne|first=Rachel |date=June 21, 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and services==
Best Enemies has also been used as a community-based education program that illustrates the issue of cyber bullying through a film based on a true story of a 15-year-old girl whose best friend betrayed her in a bullying campaign conducted via SMS and online messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php Youth Action and Policy Association NSW] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010115624/http://www.yapa.org.au/yapa/events/shift/workshops.php |date=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program targets schools and youth organisations to address the causes and consequences of the serious social problem of cyber bullying and cyber safety. The program is supported by Youth Interagency Groups, the Department of Education and Training and various agencies of the NSW Government.

The Best Enemies study guide and cybersafety resource was produced by The [[Australian Teachers of Media]] and is also distributed by The Education Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeducationshop.com.au/shop/product.asp?pID=3314&amp;cID=19 The Education Shop - Best Enemies Study Guide and DVD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is supported by [[Hoyts]], [[Girlfriend Magazine]], Mentos Cube, [[Myspace]] and Point Zero Youth Services.

==Partnership with Bully Free Australia Foundation==
In March 2013, Best Enemies and The Bully Free Australia Foundation signed a partnership agreement with a vision to "protect and empower Australian children and adolescents to live a fulfilling life free from all forms of bullying".

On 16 March 2013, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard formally opened The Bully Free Australia Foundation at Essendon Airport to a crowd of more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/bill-to-stop-workplace-bullies-20130316-2g76e.html|title=Bill to stop workplace bullies |last=Schetzer|first=Alana |date=March 16, 2013|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chironomia''' is the art of using gesticulations or hand gestures to good effect in traditional [[rhetoric]] or [[Eloquence|oratory]].   Effective use of the hands, with or without the use of the voice, is a practice of great antiquity, which was developed and systematized by the Greeks and the Romans.  Various gestures had conventionalized meanings which were commonly understood, either within certain class or professional groups, or broadly among dramatic and oratorical audiences.

[[Gilbert Austin]] was a well-known author on chironomia. The article about him contains a summary of theories in chironomia.

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

== Style ==
Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6529">The '''Council for the Development of French in Louisiana''' ('''CODOFIL'''; {{lang-fr|le Conseil pour le développement du français en Louisiane}}) is Louisiana's Office of Francophone Affairs ({{lang-fr|Agence des affaires francophones}}). It is a state agency whose multiple legislative mandates include developing opportunities to use the [[French language]] in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=216790]." SB800 by Senator Eric Lafleur. Retrieved on July 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; CODOFIL is governed by a board of 23 members and administratively placed within the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development's Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, overseen by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/culture/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707134249/http://www.crt.state.la.us/culture/ |archivedate=2013-07-07 |df= }}." CODOFIL. Retrieved on July 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; CODOFIL is the only state agency in the United States whose purpose is to serve a linguistic population.

Today, CODOFIL's role is to promote and support French immersion and French as a second language in education; it acts as a partner to the [[Louisiana Department of Education]] (LDOE), whose role is to manage Louisiana's school districts. CODOFIL continues to recruit and sponsor French, Belgian and Canadian associate teachers as per its accords with those countries, who are placed alongside local teachers upon LDOE's recommendation. CODOFIL encourages Louisiana Francophones to continue transmission of the state's heritage language via its scholarship program (providing opportunities for pedagogical advancement) and the Escadrille Louisiane program (which allows non-native speakers to perfect French at the Université de Rennes in exchange for a minimum 3-year teaching commitment of French in Louisiana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-nouvelleorleans.org/The-Escadrille-Louisiane-Project.html] Retrieved on August 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CODOFIL has also worked to instill pride all Louisiana Francophones in their linguistic identity rather than to uphold one variety of French language or another.&lt;ref name="Bernard"&gt;Shane K. Bernard, The ''Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2003), pp. xx, xxii–xxiii, 18–19, 33–34, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and vision==
CODOFIL's mission is to "work toward the creation of an eco-system that permits the development of French in the economic, educational, cultural and professional sectors and in which Louisiana's French and Creole speakers are valorized in their cultural and linguistic identity." It seeks to "provide access to economic, educational, cultural and professional opportunities in French to all Louisianians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iberianet.com/news/i-m-cajun-and-proud-bills-in/article_be7b927c-a384-11e2-8906-0019bb2963f4.html|title='I'm Cajun and  proud' bills in|first=SARAH BLANCHARD,THE DAILY|last=IBERIAN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board==
CODOFIL originally consisted of a chairman and an advisory committee, all appointed by the governor of Louisiana. Today it is administered by a president, an executive director, and a board of as many as 23 non-paid directors. In addition to the governor, various Louisiana organizations nominate and select board members, who serve for a term of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/louisiana/la-laws/louisiana_revised_statutes_25-651|title=» Louisiana Revised Statutes 25:651 – Creation; domicile; purposesLawServer|website=www.lawserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[James R. Domengeaux]], a former state legislator and former United States Congressman of ethnic French descent, was the driving force behind CODOFIL's creation. A semi-retired attorney at the time, Domengeaux began his crusade for restoring French in Louisiana after Senator [[Edgar G. "Sonny" Mouton, Jr.]], of Lafayette obtained passage of an "urge-and-request" resolution for Louisiana school boards to help reverse the decline of the use of the French language within the state. Domengeaux traveled around Louisiana to gain support for his campaign to make Louisiana a bilingual state through French language education. By the spring of 1968, Domengeaux had gained enough interest from the public and support from officials, to present his plan to the legislature. Legislators, such as [[J. Burton Angelle]] of [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/politics/state/2015/08/29/angelle-local-guy-long-term-vision/71398046/|title=Angelle: Local guy with a long-term vision|author=Ken Stickney|date=August 29, 2015|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
voted to create CODOFIL, and the measure was signed into law in July 1968 by Governor [[John McKeithen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Master of Arts |chapter=1 |title="CODOFIL: A Case Study of an Ethnic Interest Group"|last=Simon |first=Anne |year=1977 |publisher=University of Southwestern Louisiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law empowered CODOFIL to "do any and all things necessary to accomplish the development, utilization, and preservation of the French language ... for the cultural, economic, and tourist[ic] benefit of the State."

==Criticism==
CODOFIL's early efforts to introduce French language education in public classrooms were criticized by many observers. They criticized its emphasis on international French instead of that common to Louisiana, and its use of [[Francophonie|Francophone]] teachers from [[France]], Switzerland, [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]], rather than local teachers. Administrators were said to be deprecating toward the Cajun culture it claimed to be saving.

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

The '''''Dialogus de oratoribus''''' is a short work attributed to [[Tacitus]], in [[dialogue]] form, on the art of [[rhetoric]]. Its date of composition is unknown, though its dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] places its publication around 102 AD.

The dialogue itself, set in the 70s AD, follows the tradition of [[Cicero]]'s speeches on philosophical and rhetorical arguments.&lt;ref name=Tarrant1987&gt;{{citation | last=Tarrant | first=R. J. | year=1987 | title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 90 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-37937-4 | page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the home of [[Curiatius Maternus]], one of the speakers, to whom two leading lawyers of the day, [[Marcus Aper]] and [[Julius Secundus]], have come to discuss a recent event; the fourth speaker, [[Gaius Vipstanus Messalla Gallus]], arrives later. All four men are attested historical personages. The beginning of the work is a speech in defence of eloquence and poetry. It then deals with the decadence of oratory, for which the cause is said to be the decline of the education, both in the family and in the school, of the future orator. The education is not as accurate as it once was; the teachers are not prepared and a useless rhetoric often takes the place of the general culture.

After a [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the ''Dialogus'' ends with a speech delivered by Maternus reporting what some believe is Tacitus's opinion. Maternus thinks that great oratory was possible with the freedom from any power, more precisely in the [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]], that characterized the [[Roman Republic]] during the civil wars. It became anachronistic and impracticable in the quiet and ordered society that resulted from the institution of the [[Roman Empire]]. The peace, warranted by the Empire, should be accepted without regret for a previous age that was more favorable to the wide spread of literacy and the growth of great personality.

Some believe that at the base of all of Tacitus's work is the acceptance of the Empire as the only power able to save the state from the chaos of the civil wars. The Empire reduced the space of the orators and of the political men, but there is no viable alternative to it. Nevertheless, Tacitus does not accept the imperial government apathetically, and he shows, as in the ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the remaining possibility of making choices that are dignified and useful to the state.

The date of publication of the ''Dialogus'' is uncertain, but it was probably written after the ''Agricola'' and the ''Germania''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so much so that the its authenticity may be questioned, even if it is always grouped with the ''Agricola'' and the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' in the manuscript tradition. The way of speaking in the ''Dialogus'' seems closer to the model of Cicero, refined but not prolix, which inspired the teaching of [[Quintilian]]; it lacks the incongruities that are typical of Tacitus's major historical works. It may have been written when Tacitus was young; its dedication to Fabius Iustus would thus give the date of publication, but not the date of writing. More probably, the unusually classical style may be explained by the fact that the ''Dialogus'' is a work of rhetoric. For this genre the structure, the language, and the style of Cicero were the usual models.

'''Digital rhetoric''' is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through [[digital media]]. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through [[multimedia]] platforms. [[Rhetoric]] combines multiple methods such as [[persuasion]], effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, G. (n.d.). What is Rhetoric? Retrieved December 3, 2014, from [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm What is Rhetoric?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal ''[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]'' holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot/article/view/242/153/|title=#DefineRhetoric 2014|work=Harlot of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Definition===

The term digital rhetoric was coined by [[rhetoric]]ian Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, ''The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3661152.html|title=The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts|author=Lanham, R. A.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=9780226468853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, rhetorician [[Elizabeth Losh]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://losh.ucsd.edu/ Elizabeth Losh]&lt;/ref&gt; offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, ''Virtualpolitik'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Losh, E.|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtualpolitik|title=Virtualpolitik|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262123044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
# [[Public rhetoric]],  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
#  The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
# Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losh|first1=Elizabeth|title=Virtualpolitik: An Electronic History of Government Media-Making in a Time of War, Scandal, Disaster, Miscommunication, and Mistakes|date=2009|publisher=MIT|pages=47–48|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023101108/http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book ''Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice'': “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052684|language=en|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: [[digital literacy]], visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}}

===Scope of influence===
As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an [[encyclopedia]]. Teachers can use [[podcast]]s, YouTube videos, and [[social media]] sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of [[visual rhetoric]] on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities.&lt;ref name="Sparby"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparby|first=Erika|date=April 2018|title=Digital Social Media and Aggression: Memetic Rhetoric in 4chan’s Collective Identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516300810|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.

====Education====
The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, "...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J. Elizabeth|date=2010|title=The Digital Imperative: Making the Case for a 21st-Century Pedagogy|url=|journal=Computers and Composition: An International Journal for Teachers of Writing|volume=27|pages=27–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Teaching Digital Rhetoric: Community, Critical Engagement, and Application|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197069/pdf|journal=Pedagogy|volume= 6| issue =  2|pages=231–259|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.

Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceball.com/ Cheryl Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; specializes in areas that consist of [[wikt:multimodal|multimodal]] composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing [[pedagogy]]. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, ''Second Life,'' and blogs. In doing so, she managed to "engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice|last1=Eyman|first=Douglas|first2=|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-472-07268-2|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to multimodality has &amp;nbsp;also influenced ''Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing''  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.

Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.

==== Politics ====
The increase in [[Digitization|digitalization]] of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham &amp; Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

* The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. 
* The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. 
* The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Liang|last1=Jiang|title=Why context matters: the role of campaign context in the relationship between digital media use and political participation|journal=[[Australian Journal of Political Science]]|volume=52|number=4|pages=580–598|doi=10.1080/10361146.2017.1373064|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lisa M.|last1=Kruse|first2=Dawn R.|last2=Norris|first3=Jonathan R.|last3=Flinchum|title=Social Media as a Public Sphere? Politics on Social Media|journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]]|volume=59|number=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1080/00380253.2017.1383143|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, social media has shown to be  useful in the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential  election — which marked a guideline for future elections.&lt;ref&gt;Petros Iosifidis &amp; Mark Wheeler (2018) Modern Political Communication and Web 2.0 in Representative Democracies, Javnost - The Public, 25:1-2, 111-112, DOI:10.1080/13183222.2018.1418962&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people [[demographics]], behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreiss|first2=Shannon C.|last2=McGregor|title=Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=156–157|doi=10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German [[Bundestag]], he found that the types  of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and  law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz &amp; Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Stephen J.|date=December 2015|title=TWITTER AND THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF TWEETS AND MEDIA COVERAGE|url=http://sjmcconnell.com/donaldtrumptwitter/|journal=New York University, Master's Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of "values" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.

Hillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.

Jeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.

[[Digital media]] has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wendy|last2=Tinati|first2=Ramine|last3=Jennings|first3=Will|date=2018-01-05|title=From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267982/|journal=Computer|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1109/mc.2018.1151005|issn=0018-9162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

* Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list|title=A List of Twitter Handles for Members of Congress|work=Social Feed Manager|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the [[United States Senate|Senate]] side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former [[George Miller (California politician)|Congressman George Miller]], Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Rolfe Daus|date=December 2012|title=To tweet or not to tweet: Exploring the determinants of early adoption of Twitter by House members in the 111th Congress|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=49|issue=4|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.002|issn=0362-3319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[John Culberson|Representative John Culberson]] said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to [[Pew Research Center|PEW Research center]] 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_SocialMediaAndPoliticalEngagement_PDF.pdf|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=Rainie, Smith, Schlozman, Brady, Verba|first=Lee, Aaron, Kay Lehman, Henry, Sidney|date=October 2012|website=PEW Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the House of Representatives were active on twitter.
* When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/10/19/social-media-and-political-engagement/|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christine|date=July 2017|title=Introduction : Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=16|issue=3–4|pages=207–211|via=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2017.1345828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called [[Bacău|Bacau]] only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/facts-about-the-changing-digital-news-landscape/|title=10 facts about the changing digital news landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; [[Donald Trump]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

===Rhetoric to digital rhetoric===
[[Rhetoric]] is defined as the art of [[discourse]], and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maryvican.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/cicero%e2%80%99s-classical-canons-of-rhetoric-their-relevance-and-importance-to-the-corporate-workplace/|title=Cicero's Classical Canons of Rhetoric: Their Relevance and Importance to the Corporate Workplace|date=2008-04-23|website=Mary|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the [[database]], the [[hypertext]], the [[cybertext]], and other [[born-digital]] texts. [[Inventio]]n,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Delagrange, Susan|year=2009|title=Wunderkammer, Cornell, and the Visual Canon of Arrangement|journal=Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/delagrange/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dispositio|arrangement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yancey, Kathleen Blake|year=2004|title=Looking for sources of coherence in a fragmented world: Notes toward a new assessment design|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=21|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2003.08.024|url=http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813015840/http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elocutio|style]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brooke, Collin|year=2002|title=''Enculturation: Special Multi-journal Issue on Electronic Publication''|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; take on new meanings while [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]]&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; is elevated to new importance, and [[Memoria|memory]] comes to refer to textual forms like search engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Wysocki|author2=Johndan Johnson-Eilola|author3=Cynthia L.

Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology "support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration".&lt;ref name=Zappen&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zappen, James|title=Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory|year=2005|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=319–325|url=http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Vita/DigitalRhetoric2005.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15427625tcq1403_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.

===Shift from print to digital===
Dennis Baron states, "The first writing technology was writing itself." While previous writing technologies involved pencils and [[hieroglyphics]], the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, D. (n.d.)|title=From Pencils to Pixels: The Stages of Literacy Technology|accessdate=January 1, 2014|publisher=english.illinois.edu|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the [[Greek alphabet]], and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=What is Digital Rhetoric?|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebsoslgfgts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a [[technoculture]]. 
Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the "margins of literate culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bolter, J.|year=1991|title=Writing space: The computer, hypertext, and the history of writing|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Appropriation===
In the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most "contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reyman, J.|year=2013|title=User Data on the Social Web: Authorship, Agency, and Appropriation|journal=College English, |volume=75|issue=5|pages=513–532|accessdate=November 1, 2014|via=ncte.org|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CE/0755-may2013/CE0755User.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.

===Avatar===
James E. Porter defines avatar as a "virtual body".&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a "realm of ideas", there are still [[social issue]]s, such as [[gender discrimination]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Kolko"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kolko, Beth E.|year=1999|title=Representing bodies in virtual space: The rhetoric of avatar design|journal=Information Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1080/019722499128484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a "realm of ideas", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Kolko" /&gt; Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woolums, V.|date=Fall 2011|title=Gendered Avatar Identity. Kairos|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation===
[[Rhetorical circulation|Circulation]] theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated.  Henry Jenkins "sticky vs. spreadable media" applies to circulation.  Essentially, "sticky" media is media that can be spread. 
A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.

"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what [[Karl Marx]] calls a "one-sided" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001|via=|isbn=978-0-472-05268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a [[collaborative writing|co-authorship]] directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book "Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating ecologies for digital media work: The case of English studies|last=Braun|first=Chaterine, C|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is scholarship", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Catherine, C|last2=Gilbert|first2=Kenneth, L|date=|title=This is Scholarship|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/braun_gilbert/index.html|journal=Kairos|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Daren Brabham defines [[Crowdsourcing]] as, "using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Brabham, Daren. ''Crowdsourcing''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] and [[Copyright]] are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bashayr|first=A. (Et al.)|date=|title=Legal and Ethical Issues of Crowdsourcing|url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume167/number10/alqahtani-2017-ijca-914324.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery===
For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term "delivery" is often aligned with the term "performance".  The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word "hypokrisis", or "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;

===Electracy===
[[Electracy]] is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.&lt;ref&gt;''Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print'' —Gregory Ulmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, "Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of &amp;nbsp;'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Composition: Video Culture, Writing and Electracy.|last=Arroyo|first=Sarah|publisher=SIU Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0809331468|location=|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Kairos ===
''[[Kairos]],'' in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Cynthia|date=1993|title=Kairos and Kenneth Burke's Psychology of Political and Social Communication|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=291–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kairos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotles Rhetorical Situation|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/625/03/|accessdate=2018-04-22|first1=Ethan|last1=Sproat|first2=Dana Lynn|last2=Driscoll|first3=Allen|last3=Brizee|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a more modern definition expands that view to include [[Multimodality|multimodal]] texts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M. Sheridan|author2=Jim Ridolfo|author3=Anthony J. Michel|lastauthoramp=y|date=March 19, 2012|title=The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric|location=Anderson, South Carolina|publisher=Parlor Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with [[mnemonics]] (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind."&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite web|author=Burton, G. (n.d.)|title=What is Rhetoric?|accessdate=December 3, 2014|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind sharing ===
Mind sharing is a way to get [[collective intelligence]]—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing Everything|last=Zoref|first=Lior|publisher=Portfolio|year=2015|isbn=978-1591846659|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodality===
[[Multimodality]] means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies|last=Ball|first=Cheryl|last2=Charlton|first2=Colin|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Adler-Kassner|editor-first=Linda|location=|pages=|chapter=All Writing is Multimodal|editor2-last=Wardle|editor2-first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
[[Remix]] is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Virginia|date=|title=The Rhetoric of Remix|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/358/279|journal=Transformative Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern [[technology]] develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Remediation_and_Remix|title=Digital Rhetoric/Remediation and Remix - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in ''Kairos'' as "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|last=DeVoss|first=Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole|date=2009-01-15|website=kairos.technorhetoric.net|language=English|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of [[meme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

===Rhetorical velocity===
[[Rhetorical velocity]] is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as "a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ridolfo, J.|author2=Devoss, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|journal=Kairos|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual rhetoric ===
[[Visual rhetoric]] relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states "the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hocks, M.|year=2003|title=Understanding Visual Rhetoric in Digital Writing Environments|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=54|issue=4|pages=629–656|jstor=3594188|doi=10.2307/3594188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images "do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Handa, C.|year=2004|chapter=Reading the Visual in College Writing Classes By Charles Hill|title=Visual rhetoric in a digital world: A critical sourcebook|location=Boston|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.

==Controversies==

===Access===
Referred to as the [[digital divide]], issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in [[computers and writing]] circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reynolds, Thomas J.|author2=Charles R.

===Copyright issues===
Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." Zappen's statement of "infinite" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright.  These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zappen" /&gt; 

=== Cyberbullying ===
One controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is [[Cyberbullying]].  An example can be seen in the TLC television series, [[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as "hillbillies") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Carissa|date=Spring 2018|title=The rhetoric of the real: stereotypes of rural youth in American reality television and stock photography|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sparby"/&gt;

===Legitimacy===

There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Borgman, Christine|title=Scholarship in a Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Gary|title=What are Trends in Scholarly Publishing?|url=http://www.asha.org/Academic/questions/Trends-Scholarly-Publishing/}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=MiguelAngelFimbres |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars struggle to "claim academic legitimacy" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball, Cheryl E.|year=2004|title=Show, not tell: The value of new media scholarship|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|volume=21|issue=4|pages=403–425|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2004.08.001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023081524/http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like ''Kairos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/ Kairos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harlot of the Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enculturation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enculturation.net/ Enculturation]&lt;/ref&gt; are already available through open access.

===Open access===
Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.

A '''display case''' ('''showcase''', '''display cabinet''', or '''vitrine''') is a [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] with one or often more [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[glass]] (or [[plastic]], normally [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] for strength) surfaces, used to display objects for viewing. A display case may appear in an [[exhibition]], [[museum]], [[Retailing|retail store]], [[restaurant]], or [[house]]. Often, labels are included with the displayed objects, providing information such as description or prices. In a museum, the displayed [[cultural artifact]]s are normally part of the museum's [[Collection (museum)|collection]], or are part of a temporary exhibition. In retail or a restaurant, the items are normally being offered for sale. A '''trophy case''' is used to display sports [[trophy|trophies]] or other awards.

==Description==
A display case may be freestanding on the floor, or built-in (usually a custom installation). Built-in displays may be mounted on the wall, may act as [[Room divider|room partitions]], or may be hung from the ceiling. On occasion, display cases are built into the floor, such as at the [[Museum of Sydney]] (in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]), where the remains of drains and [[Outhouse|privies]] are shown in their original context, along with other [[archeological artifact]]s.&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Sydney Guidebook|url=http://www.hht.net.au/discover/highlights/guidebooks/museum_of_sydney_guidebook|work=Sydney Living Museums|publisher=Historic Houses Trust of NSW|accessdate=2014-01-03|quote=Underfloor: The remains of first Government House’s drains and privies are exposed below the floor. Also displayed is a selection of relics, ruins and rubbish from the house retrieved by archaeologists in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of freestanding showcases: counter, middle floor (mid-floor), and wall.&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;{{cite web|title=Display cases|url=http://theshopcompany.com/display-cases.html|work=The Shop Company|publisher=The Shop Company|accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counter showcases are designed to display objects through one side (the "customer side") and have them accessible through the other (the "clerk side"). For this reason, the counter displays are most relevant for retail stores. The middle floor cases are built to display objects from all sides, and are meant to be placed in the middle of the room. Wall showcases are meant to be placed against a wall, where the products are displayed and accessed from the same side. These last two types are used heavily – not only by stores – but also by museums, schools, and especially in homes to showcase valuable items or collections. 

Display cases are typically made by specialist companies with a background in woodworking or welding, and come in standard sizes or often are custom order. Display cases are often designed with [[security]] in mind and are normally [[lockable]]. They also are made in variety of styles, shapes, and materials as available at a store fixture supplier. They can ship pre-assembled or [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|knockdown]] (in pieces to be assembled by the customer). Pre-assembled showcases are assembled (and usually tested) by the manufacturer, and are shipped ready-to-use. Knockdown showcases are usually lower in price and cheaper to ship, but may be of poorer quality than pre-assembled, and may arrive missing pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8208">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Dispositio''' is the system used for the organization of arguments in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is [[Latin]], and can be translated as "organization" or "arrangement".

It is the second of five canons of classical rhetoric (the first being [[inventio]], and the remaining being [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing.

The first part of any rhetorical exercise was to discover the proper arguments to use, which was done under the formalized methods of ''inventio''. The next problem facing the orator or writer was to select various arguments and organize them into an effective discourse.

== Aristotle ==
[[Aristotle]] defined two essential parts of a discourse: the statement of the case and the proof of the case. For example, in a legal argument, a prosecutor must first declare the charges against the defendant and provide the relevant facts; then he must present the evidence that proves guilt. Aristotle allowed that in practice most discourse also requires an introduction and a conclusion.

== Latin rhetoric ==
Later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]] refined this organizational scheme even further, so that there were eventually six parts:
* the introduction, or ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''. The term exordium comes from the Latin term meaning "to urge forward." In the exordium, the speaker gives their main argument, and all the relevant information.
* the statement of the case, or ''narratio''. Quintilian explained that in the narratio "we shall for instance represent a person accused of theft as covetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of homicide as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities to these persons if we are defending them; further we must do the same with place, time and the like". 
* the outline of the major points in the argument, or ''divisio'' (sometimes known as ''partitio''). It has two functions: to name the issues in dispute and to list the arguments to be used in the order they will appear.
* the proof of the case, or ''confirmatio''. It confirms or validates the material given in the narratio and partitio.
* the refutation of possible opposing arguments, or ''confutatio''. If the rhetor anticipates that certain people in his audience may disagree with his speech, he must be prepared to refute the argument that could possibly be presented in opposition to his original speech.
* the conclusion, or ''peroratio''. Cicero taught that a rhetor can do three things in this step: sum up his arguments, cast anyone who disagrees with him in a negative light, and arouse sympathy for himself, his clients, or his case.

While this structure might appear to be highly rigid (and certainly some writers on the subject were overly pedantic), it was in practice a flexible model. Cicero and Quintilian, for example, encouraged writers to rearrange the structure when it strengthened their case: for instance, if the opposing arguments were known to be powerful, it might be better to place the refutation before the proof.

Within each major part, there were additional tactics that might be employed. For instance, a prosecutor might sum up his case with forceful repetition of his main points using a technique known as ''[[accumulatio]]''. The defense attorney in the same case might use a different approach in his summation.

Finally, ''dispositio'' was also seen as an iterative process, particularly in conjunction with ''[[inventio]]''. The very process of organizing arguments might lead to the need to discover and research new ones. An orator would refine his arguments and their organization until they were properly arranged. He would then proceed to those areas that we generally associate with rhetoric today&amp;mdash;the development of the style and delivery of the arguments.

===''Exordium''===
The ''exordium'' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɔr|d|i|ə|m}}; meaning "beginning" in [[Latin]]; from ''exordiri'', meaning "to begin") was the introductory portion of an oration. The term is Latin and the Greek equivalent was called the ''[[proem]]'' or ''prooimion''. 

In the ''exordium'', the orator lays out the purpose of the discourse. In doing this, they need to consider several things:

* What kind of cause is he presenting? For instance, is it an honorable cause (defense of a hero) or a dishonorable one (defense of a murderer)?
* Should a direct opening be favoured, or should the opening be more subtle and indirect? 
* In what manner ought the speaker to proceed (e.g., light-heartedly or seriously)?
* The speaker should introduce their own character or credentials, so as to make the audience predisposed to believing their arguments.
* If required, or possible, the speaker might also call into question the character or credentials of his opponent.
* Lastly, the speaker must avoid certain faults in the introduction. For example, this excerpt from the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' lists several faults:

:"In the Introduction of a cause we must make sure that our style is temperate and that the words are in current use, so that the discourse seems unprepared. An Introduction is faulty if it can be applied as well to a number of causes; that is called a banal Introduction. Again, an Introduction which the adversary can use no less well is faulty, and that is called a common Introduction. That Introduction, again, is faulty which the opponent can turn to his own use against you. And again that is faulty which has been composed in too laboured a style, or is too long; and that which does not appear to have grown out of the cause itself in such a way to have an intimate connection with the Statement of Facts; and, finally, that which fails to make the hearer well disposed or receptive or attentive." (''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', I. vii, 11, trans. Harry Caplan, Loeb Classical Library, 1954.)

In short, the ''exordium'' was the portion of the discourse in which the orator would prepare the audience to hear his arguments in a favorable frame of mind. "An exordium can serve different kinds of functions in the differing species of rhetoric, but in all of them some of the major themes of the coming discourse will be announced in advance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters and Homilies For Hellenized Christians Volume II|last=Witherington III|first=Ben|publisher=IVP Academic|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8308-2933-0|location=USA|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Peroratio''===
The ''peroratio'' ("peroration"), as the final part of a speech, had two main purposes in classical rhetoric: to remind the audience of the main points of the speech (''recapitulatio'') and to influence their emotions (''affectus'').  The role of the peroration was defined by Greek writers on rhetoric, who called it ''epilogos''; but it is most often associated with Roman orators, who made frequent use of emotional appeals.  A famous  example was the speech of [[Marcus Antonius Orator|Marcus Antonius]] in defence of [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Aquillius]], during which Antonius tore open the tunic of Aquillius to reveal his battle scars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'', [http://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/cic_web/de_or_2.htm  2.xlvii.194]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century B.C. it was common for two or more speakers to appear on each side in major court cases.  In such cases it was considered a mark of honour to be asked to deliver the peroration.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', [http://www.attalus.org/old/brutus3.html#190  190]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Musical Arts''' ('''D.M.A.''') is a [[doctorates|doctoral]] [[academic degree]] in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually [[Performance|music performance]], [[music composition]], or [[conducting]]) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or [[Music education|music pedagogy]]. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional [[performance|performers]], [[conducting|conductors]], and [[musical composition|composers]]. As a [[terminal degree]], the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in [[musicology]] or [[music theory]] typically enter a [[Ph.D.]] program, rather than a D.M.A. program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as '''DMA''' (without periods), '''D.Mus.A.''' or '''A.Mus.D.'''. For the related degree [[Doctor of Music]], the abbreviation is '''D.M.''' or '''D.Mus.''' For the related degree [[Doctor of Arts]], the abbreviation '''D.A.''' is used.

==Types==
===Concentrations===
The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title [[Doctor of Music]] (D.M. or D.Mus.) or [[Doctor of Arts]] (D.A.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/music/degree_programs/grad_degrees.html The University of Mississippi – Department of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Latimer, "The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music," ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education'', 32.1 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into [[online music education]] by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a [[Master of Music]] program) in [[music education]].&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may  place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written [[dissertation]], regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D.  Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University – Conducting Degrees|url=http://www.music.fsu.edu/Areas-of-Study/Conducting/Degree-Programs|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in [[music theory]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], and [[ethnomusicology]].
===Sacred music===
A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also ''Sacrae Musica Doctor'' (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance.  In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.).  Only one U.S. institution, [[Claremont Graduate University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Graduate University – Doctor of Church Music|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8740.asp|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A.  The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at [[Perkins School of Theology]] is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/FacultyAcademics/degrees/dpm/Apply Perkins School of Theology – Doctor of Ministry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  While more theology-based and housed within the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

==Components==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a [[comprehensive exam]] on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or research project and the performance of [[recital]]s, usually including at least one lecture-recital.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.

Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field ''outside'' music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in [[piano pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of [[computer engineering]] (e.g., in computer programming).

While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a [[teaching assistant]] or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.

To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of "B+" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.

Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.

== Brief history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
After World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many [[alumni]] of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work "in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided." The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the [[American Council on Education]]. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

* [[Eastman School of Music]] (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953)

The Dean of the [[University of Rochester]] [[Eastman School of Music]], Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Degrees to Musicians – Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', November 15, 1953, p. 9F&lt;/ref&gt;

The alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities.  The conservatories that are not affiliated with the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] began offering DMAs in the late 1960s.

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

A '''dominant culture''' is a cultural practice that is [[Dominance hierarchy|dominant]]  within a particular political, social or economic entity, in which multiple cultures are present. It may refer to a [[language]], [[religion]]/[[ritual]], [[value (ethics)|social value]]  and/or [[social custom]]. These features are often a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] for an entire [[society]]. It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of "dominant culture" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title= A Dictionary of Sociology | year=1998|author=Gordon Marshall|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture that is dominant within a particular [[geopolitical entity]] can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation.  In a [[multicultural]] society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of [[minority culture]]s or [[subculture]]s.

==Examples and applications==

===Native American studies===
In the [[United States]], a distinction is often made between the [[indigenous culture]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and a dominant culture that may be described as "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so on.  Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own [[Native American tribe|tribe]], community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= |date=May 1974 |title=The Native American in Juvenile Fiction: Teacher Perception  of Stereotypes |url=http://jaie.asu.edu/v13/V13S2tea.html |journal=Journal of American Indian Education |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages= |author=Maria Falkenhagen and Inga K.

There are many methods for teaching [[Drama]].  Each strategy involves varying levels of student participation.

==Drama games==
Drama games, activities and exercises are often used to introduce students to drama.  These activities tend to be less intrusive and are highly participatory (e.g. [[Bang (Drama Game)|Bang]]).

There are several books that have been written on using drama games that can serve as excellent resources for anyone wanting to incorporate drama games into their work. [[Augusto Boal|Games for Actors and Non-Actors]] by [[Augusto Boal]] is perhaps the best known internationally and includes writings on his life work as well as hundreds of games. There are also smaller books however, which serve as excellent practical guides. For example, Drama Games by [[Bernie Warren]] is an excellent pocket book for someone looking to try drama games for the first time.

==Choral speaking==
Choral dramatization involves students reading aloud by assigning parts to each group member.  Choral dramatization can use texts such as [[rhymes]], [[poetry]], and [[picture books]].  Students can experiment with voice, sound gesture and movement (Swartz, 1995).

==Tableaux==
[[Tableau vivant|Tableaux]] involve students creating visual pictures with their bodies, emphasizing key details and relationships (Wilheim, 2002). Tableaux are frozen scenes and usually involve at least three levels.  Students focus on a focal point, facial expressions, and body language.  This technique is useful for maturing participants' presentational skills as well as audience skills.

==Improvisation==
[[Improvisation]] is the practice of acting and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one’s immediate environment; see [[Improvisation|Wikipedia: Improvisation]]. Improvisation can be a great introduction to role playing.  Students focus on position, expression and creativity in their impromptu skits.

==Role playing==
Role playing allows students to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a real or imaginary situation.  One of the simplest forms is where “the student plays himself faced with an imaginary situation.” (Wilheim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;62) Other strategies have students playing real-life or imaginary characters in a variety of contexts.  Role play can be used throughout many areas of the curriculum, especially [[history]] and [[language arts]] to support and strengthen understanding of content.  Below is a list of some common role-play strategies.

* [[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]]: Students perform scenes from a historical time period or a scene in a story.  “An enactment may be cast in the past, the present, or the future, but always happens in the ‘now of time’” (Wilheim, 2002, p.8).  This strategy encourages students to interact with a text and challenges them to take on the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of a character.
* Extended role play: Students may create the scene that takes place before or after a story or scene.  This strategy helps students to predict and theorize about cause and effect.
* Hotseat: Student is interviewed in character.  By putting the character from a scene, event or story on the “stand” students can further explore their understanding of the content.  Other students in the class prepare questions that explore the character and their conflicts.  Students are encouraged to write open-ended questions.  Teachers may wish to model hotseating first by acting as the character in the role.  Also, the person in the hotseat may have a couple of students who act as their “brain.”  They are there to help answer questions if the person on the hotseat needs them.  There are many variations available for this strategy.
* Teacher In Role: This strategy is key to involving teacher participation.  This strategy can take on many forms.  The teacher may take on the role of a character or figure from the event, scene or story.  The primary objective of this strategy is to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues.  The teacher may also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters.  The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama.
* Expert panel: Students themselves become an [[expert]].  In order to prepare for this role students must determine what an expert in the area might know.  This works well in history or when focusing on broader issues/topics in literature.  This strategy can unfold by having students meet as a group of experts or by having students meet in pairs in an [[interview]] situation.
* Writing in role: A variation on the above strategies, students may also write in character.  Often they are asked to imagine themselves as a real or fictitious character in a particular state or situation.  Writing in role can take on many forms including a journal, letter, monologue, or newspaper article.  This is not meant to be a summary of the story, but instead a further exploration of the character and their interaction with events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16465">'''Dream world''' (also called '''dream realm''' or '''illusory realm''') is a commonly used [[plot device]] in [[fiction]]al works, most notably in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]]. The use of a dream world creates a situation whereby a [[fictional character|character]] (or group of characters) is placed in a marvellous and unpredictable environment and must overcome several personal problems to leave it. The dream world also commonly serves to teach some [[moral]] or [[religious]] lessons to the character experiencing it – a lesson that the other characters will be unaware of, but one that will influence decisions made regarding them. When the character is reintroduced into the real world (usually when they wake up), the question arises as to what exactly constitutes [[reality]] due to the vivid recollection and experiences of the dream world.

According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], dream worlds contrast with [[fantasy world]]s, in which the world has existence independent of the characters in it.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', [[Ballantine Books]], New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; However, other authors have used the dreaming process as a way of accessing a world which, within the context of the fiction, holds as much consistency and continuity as physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences...&lt;br&gt;
... Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
– H.P. Lovecraft, from "Beyond the Wall of Sleep", as reprinted in ''The Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death'' (Del Rey, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "dream frames" to contain a fantasy world, and so explain away its marvels, has been criticized and has become much less prevalent.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Dreams", p. 297 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional dream worlds==
{{Pop culture|date=February 2018}}
===Literature===
A similar motif, [[Locus amoenus]], is popular in medieval literature (esp. allegory and romance). A dream world is sometimes invoked in [[dream vision]]s such as ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 24.png|right|225px|thumb|The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland.]]
One of the best-known dream worlds is [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as well as [[Looking-Glass Land]] from its sequel, ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and causality flexible. [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[Smirt]]'' and its two sequels taken together form an extended dream and most of their action takes place in a dream world.

The action of ''[[The Bridge (novel)|The Bridge]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]] and ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]]'' by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] take place in dream worlds. Other fictional dream worlds include the [[Dreamlands]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Dream Cycle]]''  and ''[[The Neverending Story]]''{{'}}s world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by [[Philip K. Dick]], such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' and ''[[Ubik]]''. Similar themes were explored by  [[Jorge Luis Borges]], for instance in ''[[The Circular Ruins]]''.

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' book series, [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] is a dream world that exists in close proximity to the real world. Objects and physical locations that do not frequently change in the real world have parallels in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]]. Ordinary people can occasionally slip into [[Tel'aran'rhiod]], and events that occur within this dream world have physical consequences. A person that dies in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] will never wake up again, and in several cases it is shown that physical injuries gained there persist to the waking world. [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] can be controlled similar to a [[lucid dream]], and several characters in the series can enter and manipulate [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] at will.

''[[Paprika (novel)|Paprika]]'' (1993) by [[Yasutaka Tsutsui]] is a [[science fiction]] novel that involves entering dream worlds using technology. In the book, dream monitoring and intervention as a means of treating [[mental disorder]]s is a developing new form of [[psychotherapy]] in the near future. Unrest ensues when a new psychotherapy dream-analysis device is stolen, allowing the assailant to enter and manipulate people's dreams.

In the feminist science fiction novel ''[[The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You]]'', the Kin of Ata maintain the real world through their dreaming, making the real world a form of  dream.

===Film===
In the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 movie]], [[Land of Oz|Oz]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was altered from a fantasy world (in the novel) to a dream world of Dorothy's; characters who were independent inhabitants of Oz were transformed into dream parallels of introduced Kansas characters.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo and the rest of the humans live inside a dream world. Their brains are hooked up to a computer network that creates this dream world. However, some may argue that this is not a dream world, as it seems completely normal and indistinguishable from reality (aside from time differences). In the 1980s, the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of horror films introduced a dark dream realm inhabited by the supernatural serial killer [[Freddy Krueger]].

In the movie ''[[Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'' the main characters enter a world dreamt up by a small boy in order to save the real world.
Down Town is the land of nightmares where all people who are in comas go in the movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''. Dreamworlds also appear in ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''.

''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006) is an [[anime]] film adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name, which involves entering and manipulating dream worlds using dream-analysis devices.

The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' takes place almost entirely in a dream realm.  In the 2010 film ''[[Inception]]'', main characters create artificial, vivid dream worlds and bring others into the dream worlds and perform various things with their brains, without them knowing. This may involve 'Extraction' (stealing memories and secrets), 'Inception' (planting an idea into the mind) and others.

===Comic books, graphic novels and animation===
[[File:Little Nemo 1906-07-22 last two panels.jpg|thumb|A panel from [[Little Nemo]] (1906).]]
One of the earliest newspaper comic strips, recounting [[Little Nemo]]'s adventures in [[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland|Slumberland]], had a dream world theme.

Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] was tasked with re-imagining a Golden Age character, "[[Sandman (DC Comics)|The Sandman]]".  In his version, the Sandman becomes [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], the Lord of Dreams (also known, to various characters throughout the series, as [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], [[Oneiroi|Oneiros]], the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, Dream Cat, Murphy, Kai'ckul, and Lord L'Zoril), who is essentially the [[anthropomorphic]] personification of [[dream]]s. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence.

Dream worlds also  appear in ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'', in the Outback(s) of ''[[The Maxx]]''; in Dream Land, the main setting of many [[Kirby series|''Kirby'' games]], in the webcomic ''[[The Dreamland Chronicles]]'',  and the movie ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS movie|Sailor Moon Super S the Movie: Black Dream Hole]]'' also have dream realms in their universes.

The ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]'' episode "Dreamscape" takes place mainly in a dream realm. Similarly, the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' episode [[Dreamscape (Xiaolin Showdown)|of the same title]] also uses the dream world in its plotline.

In ''[[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]'' manga series such as ''[[X/1999]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', the dream world is very important to the events that occur within each story. It is later revealed in ''xxxHolic'' that the dream world itself is its own world, as part of the Clamp multiverse. Similarly, in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' graphic novel series by Jeff Smith, the primary plot device is a dream world called "The Dreaming." It exists independently from the real world, and it is described similarly to a river, being said to "flow" through people in "currents."

In ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' part 3 "[[Stardust Crusaders]]," Jotaro and his friends and grandpa are put in a dream world which takes the form of an amusement park by Mannish Boy and his Death 13 stand.

In the ''[[Jay Jay the Jet Plane]]'' cartoon series, adventures where air-breathing jet planes cannot go (underwater and in space) happen as dreams.

===TV===
The ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Waking Moments]]" uses several dream realms and false awakenings. In the ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' episode "Ordeal," Foster's abduction and rescue is explained away as a dream. The whole of season 8 of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was retroactively explained, at the start of Season 9, as a dream had by [[Bobby Ewing]]. In the [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] episode, "Dreamworker", [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], god of dreams, abducts Gabrielle to take as his bride. But Xena follows them into his realm, the DreamScape, where she battles to stop the impending [[forced marriage]]. The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, "[[Amy's Choice (Doctor Who)|Amy's Choice]]" also depicts multiple dream worlds, which were found out to have been induced by a parasitic seed. Dreamworlds are revisited in the ''Doctor Who'' Christmas special, "[[Last Christmas (Doctor Who)|Last Christmas]]," which depicts dreams within dreams caused by mind-leeching aliens.

===Video games===
The video games ''[[Link's Awakening]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' take place in a dream of the Wind Fish's (whom [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must wake up) and [[Mario]]'s respectively.

''[[Alundra]]'' revolves around a dreamwalker who can enter people's dreams. It takes place on an island, where a village has locals suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dreamwalking ability, the titular protagonist Alundra attempts to help the locals by entering their dreams.

In the first two games of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'']] series, the protagonist (Ninten in ''[[EarthBound Zero]]'' and Ness in ''[[EarthBound]]'') must travel to a dream world named Magicant. However, the two Magicants are different from each other. Ninten visits his Magicant, which is light pink and has seashell spires and clouds, multiple times during the story, until it is revealed to not be his own Magicant but instead just a collection of the memories of his great-grandmother, Maria. Ness's Magicant is a surreal, spacelike land in a purple sea that Ness only gains access to once he records the eight melodies into his Sound Stone, which he then must travel to the center of in order to overcome his weaknesses, characterized by a boss battle against his 'Nightmare' (with an appearance similar to the 'Mani-Mani Statue', a mysterious object encountered in another dreamworld called Moonside), and absorb the power of the Earth into his heart.

About a half of ''[[Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams]]'' takes place in the Dream World, home to the Staff of Dreams, which was later split by Pins and Needles, where Tak has a half of the staff and Pins and Needles have the Staff of Nightmares half. By the end of the game, Tak restored the staff.

In ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie]]'', the game is split between two worlds initially known as the Real World and the Phantom World, named such because any being from the Real World is rendered unseen by the inhabitants of the Phantom World, like a phantom, and are only capable of becoming visible after drinking a special [[elixir]]. After a time, it is revealed that the Phantom World is in fact the true Real World, while the former Real World is called the Dream World, created from the dreams of the people of the Real World, in which each inhabitant has a Dream World counterpart. In addition, the main antagonist of the game, Deathtamoor, plots to try to merge both the Real World and Dream World with his own "Dark World" in an attempt for world domination.

In ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall Chapters]]'' the protagonist Zoë Castillo can travel to Marcuria by dreaming. There's a third world called 'Storytime' inspired by the Australian ''[[Dreamtime]]'' myths which is the place of the creation and where every story begins and ends. Also, the protagonist must stop a corporation called WATI-Corp which want to steal dreams and memories from people through their new entertainment device: the Dreamachine which allows people to make lucid dreams.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', the main group of protagonists sometimes experience the lives of three soldiers, [[Laguna Loire|Laguna]], [[Kiros Seagill|Kiros]], and [[Ward Zabac|Ward]] in what they call "the dream world" (which is actually the past) through a mysterious and gifted woman who is acquainted with both parties. The whole of [[Zanarkand]] in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and its [[Final Fantasy X HD|HD remake]] was a dream, along with the main character, [[Tidus]].

In the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', there is a short quest which takes place in a dream world. In the video game, ''[[Fallout 3]]'', a main storyline quest involves the main character going into a virtual reality simulator, referred to as "Tranquility Lane," a dream world simulation of a 1950s suburban neighborhood.   

Other dreamworlds are the Maginaryworld from ''[[Sonic Shuffle]]'', Dream Depot from ''[[Mario Party 5]]'', and in Nightopia and Nightmare (collectively known in a place called the "Night Dimension") from ''[[Nights into Dreams...]]'' and its sequel for the [[Wii]], ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]''.

In the video game ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'', main character John Tanner suffers a car accident that leaves him in a coma. The game take places in his dream, but the character himself doesn't realize he's dreaming. Instead, he thinks he had a lucky escape and with this, thinks that he got an ability to [[Spirit possession|possess]] other people. During the game, many billboards will turn black and show "wake up" messages.

In [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']] and its following sequel, players can tuck in one of their Pokémon via a system known as Game Sync. As the tucked in Pokémon falls asleep, it will then be sent to special website, where the player can play with his/her Pokémon in an alternate world called the "Dream World".

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', the seventh installment in the game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', the two main protagonists are sent to worlds that are in slumber and that are dreaming in order to pass the Mark of mastery exam.

The Dream World is the main focus of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team]]'' where [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] travel through a world full of Luigi's dreams.

''[[Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil]]'' takes place in Lunatea, a dream world.

'''Environmental anthropology''' is a sub-specialty&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.

== Philosophies ==

===Adaptation: environment over culture===
The sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"/&gt; The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in [[Marcel Mauss]]' ''Seasonal Variation of Eskimo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Mauss|title=''Seasonal variations of the Eskimo: a study in social morphology''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRbl6DmN8vkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33035-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed later in Julian Steward's work.&lt;ref&gt;Steward JH. 1938. The Great Basin Shoshonean Indians: An Example of A Family Level Of Sociocultural Integration. ''Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Read''. 168–180.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vayda|first1=Andrew P.|author1-link=Andrew P. Vayda|last2=McCay|first2=Bonnie J.|author2-link= Bonnie McCay |title=New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=4|pages=293|year=1975|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by [[Julian Steward]],&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"&gt;Steward JH. 1955. Theory of Cultural Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or "laws." Steward's [[ecological anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Steward JH 1955"/&gt; was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While [[Marvin Harris]]' cultural materialism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Harris|title=Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC|accessdate=3 April 2011|year=2001|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0135-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants.

=== Diversity, history and associations ===
The new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost &amp; benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Richard B.|doi=10.1525/aa.1992.94.1.02a00030|title=Art, Science, or Politics? The Crisis in Hunter-Gatherer Studies|year=1992|pages=31|volume=94|journal=American Anthropologist|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/lee1992.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with internal, independent logic and inter-connectivity's impact now were observed. Roy A. Rappaport&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport RA. 1967.

This perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as "loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity" and possible "incentives or inhibitors" in relations to behavior.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biersack|first1=Aletta|title=Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|pages=5|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods,&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt; acknowledges, "The social unit is not always well defined&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|accessdate=3 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms.&lt;ref name="Biersack A 1999"/&gt;

=== Policy and activism: politics versus environmentalism ===
The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"/&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"/&gt;

Critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they "generalize" and "obscure" local discourse and message.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/200019|author=Brosius JP|year= 1999|title= Analyses And Interventions; Anthropological Engagements With Environmentalism|journal= Current Anthropology|jstor=200019|volume= 40|pages= 277–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry.&lt;ref name="Brosius JP 1999"/&gt; An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Brosius|first1=J.|title=Green Dots, Pink Hearts: Displacing Politics from the Malaysian Rain Forest|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=1|pages=36–57|year=1999|pmid=19280759|jstor=683340|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and pioneers ===

Environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;Sponsel L. (2004, May). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecological_anthropology Ecological Anthropology]. Encyclopedia of Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;
It focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902–1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt; A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies.
Steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned.&lt;ref name="Grinker R.R 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinker|first1=ROY Richard|title=The Politics of Knowledge: Julian Steward, Leslie White, Melville Herskovits, and L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=37|pages=259|year=2008|doi=10.1080/00938150802038935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformations ===
Steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s–60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists [[John Bennett (anthropologist)|John Bennett]], [[Roy A. Rappaport]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop "cultural materialism" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. [[Eric Alden Smith]] and [[Bruce Winterhalder]] laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
Anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology.

Environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SfAA),

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the common good."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"&gt;The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). [http://www.sfaa.net/eap/ea.html “What is Environmental Anthropology?”] Accessed March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;

Environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms of diversity, and capacity for planning and development."&lt;ref name="sfaa.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as [[emic]] (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.{{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10180">The '''epideictic oratory''', also called '''ceremonial oratory''', or praise-and-blame [[rhetoric]], is one of the three branches, or "species" (eidē), of rhetoric as outlined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', to be used to praise or blame during ceremonies.

== Origin and pronunciation ==
The term's root has to do with display or show (''deixis''). It is a literary or rhetorical term from the Greek (ἐπιδεικτικός). It is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/epideictic] Another English form, now less common, is ''epidictic'' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.

== Characteristics ==
This is rhetoric of ceremony,  commemoration, declamation, demonstration, on the one hand,  and of play, entertainment,  display, including self-display.  It is also the rhetoric used at festivals, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], [[state visit]]s and other formal events like  openings, closings,  anniversaries as well as at births, deaths, or marriages.  Its major subject  is praise and blame, according to  Aristotle in the limited space  he  provides  for it  in the ''Art of  Rhetoric'' (Freese translation).  

This rhetoric deals with  goodness, excellence, nobility, shame,  honor, dishonor,  beauty, and matters  of virtue and vice. The  virtues  or the "components" of  virtue  according to Aristotle,  were "justice, courage, self-control, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative wisdom"  or "reason". Vice  was the "contrary" of virtue. 

In his book ''Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity'', Jeffrey Walker claims that epideictic rhetoric predates the rhetoric of courts and politics, the study of which began in the 5th or 4th century BC with the [[Sophists]]. The other two kinds of public speech were deliberative or political speech, and forensic, judicial, or legal speech. Epideictic rhetoric  or style is according to Aristotle most appropriate for material that is written or read. In the ''Art of Rhetoric'', Aristotle stated  that  "The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions; for its function  is reading." (423){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Aristotle on epideixis ==
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle instructs that in creating a speech of praise or blame, the author should consider the attitude of his audience: Will they be moved to see his object of praise (be it a person or a thing) in a new light, or will he be wasting everyone's time by "preaching to the choir"? What values and behavior does this particular audience find praiseworthy? Whether the audience is sympathetic, hostile, or indifferent to his object of praise or blame determines how difficult the task is that lies before him. As Aristotle reminds the reader, "[F]or as Socrates used to say, it is not difficult to praise Athenians in Athens" (''Rhetoric'',1367b).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''On Rhetoric'' Trans. by George A. Kennedy. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to [[Aristotle]]’s conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future” (''Rhet.'' 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle’s least favored and clearly defined topic.  Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, [[panegyric]]s, [[encomia]], funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the ''Art of Rhetoric'' is cited as an example of epideictic  work (Lockwood, 1996).

Epideixis may not deserve the charge of lacking depth. The charge that this branch of rhetoric lacks depth can be countered by the recognition that it systematizes the successful attribution of [[value (ethics)|value]] (to things, people, or concepts). Attributing value (whether in terms of "the good" and "the bad" or of "virtue" and "vice") to 1) perception, 2) emotions, 3) thought, 4) action, and 5) goals is the fundamental basis of relativistic conceptions of 1) [[aesthetics]], 2) human [[Sociology of emotions|character]], 3) [[intelligence]], 4) [[ethics]], and 5) [[wisdom]]. For instance, applying epideixis to 'human perceptions' yields [[aesthetics]], and its application to 'human action' yields fundamental relativistic [[ethics]]. Nevertheless, epideixis can always be reduced to simply the study of how best to preach the positive or negative characteristics of creatures, contraptions, concepts (etc.) to an audience. Epideictic rhetoric appeals to - and serves to sway - personal and cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], whereas pure deliberative and judicial rhetoric appeal to reason alone.

And, Lockwood,  also in ''Reader's Figure'',  describes how readers are figured by their readings, and how readers figure their readings, and that readers can accept the readers' account, and forget  their  own account  of their present and past,   and that the rhetor's account is  produced by language.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}

== Modern authors on epideixis ==
For centuries, epideictic [[Public speaking|oratory]] was a contested term, for it is clearly present in both forensic and deliberative forms, but it is difficult to clarify when it appears as a dominant discursive form. According to [[Chaïm Perelman]] and Lucy Olbrechts-Tyteca, “The speaker engaged in epidictic discourse is very close to being an [[educator]]. Since what he is going to say does not arouse [[controversy]], since no immediate practical interest is ever involved, and there is no question of attacking or defending, but simply of promoting values that are shared in the community . . .” (52).&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, ''The new rhetoric: a treatise on argumentation'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1969, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some of the defining terms for epideictic discourse include declamation, demonstration, praise or blame of the personal, and pleasing or inspiring to an audience.  

Lawrence W. Rosenfield contends that epideictic practice surpasses mere praise and blame, and it is more than a showy display of rhetorical skill: “Epideictic’s understanding calls upon us to join with our community in giving thought to what we witness, and such thoughtful beholding in commemoration constitutes memorializing” (133){{fcn|date=September 2018}}. Epideictic rhetoric also calls for witnessing events, acknowledging temporality and contingency (140).  However, as Rosenfield suspects, it is an uncommon form of [[discourse]] because of the rarity of “its necessary constituents — openness of mind, felt reverence for reality, enthusiasm for life, the ability to congeal significant experiences in memorable language . . .” (150).

The philologist [[Ernst Curtius]] provides an account of its history, and many examples, in ''[[European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages]]''. Praise and blame were "reduced" to praise by  Aristotle, he wrote; and recently another author called it a "blameless genre". He and Lockwood seem to say that what was in the past called rhetoric was later called literature. Curtius believed that misinterpretations  of [[medieval literature]] occur because so much of it is epideictic, and the epideictic is so alien to us today. During the Middle Ages it became a "school subject" as the sites for political activity diminished in the West, and as the centuries went on the word "praise" came to mean that which was written. During this period literature (more specifically histories, biographies, autobiographies, geographies) were called praise(s).

[[Ben Witherington III]], writing from a biblical perspective on sacred exhortation, noted that "in general, epideictic rhetoric is highly emotional and meant to inspire the audience to appreciate something or someone, or at the other end of the spectrum, despise something or someone.  Epideictic rhetoric seeks to charm or, to cast odium." - I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary &lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary - [http://libraryofrhetoric.org/lor/?page_id=90 More Quotes on Epideixis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Epideictic writing in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]] is often associated with the [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' rhapsody]] that developed in the early [[Han Dynasty]].  This highly ornamented style was used for almost any subject imaginable, and often incorporated obscure language with extensive cataloguing of rare items, all in verse of varying rhyme and line length.&lt;ref&gt;[[David R. Knechtges]], Wen Xuan: ''or Selections of Refined Literature''. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commendatory verse''' is a genre of epideictic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Quentin Skinner]]|title=Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJO9y-sPdLAC&amp;pg=PA57|date=22 February 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55436-7|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance and Early Modern European tradition, it was taken to glorify both its author and the person to whom it was addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marina Frasca-Spada|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Books and the Sciences in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUmhAeUZtbsC&amp;pg=PA121|date=2 November 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65939-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prefatory verses of this kind—i.e. those printed as [[preface]] to a book—became a recognised type of advertising in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Bermingham|author2=John Brewer|title=The Consumption of Culture 1600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U7bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80840-3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:America First – The Netherlands Second.png|thumb|300px|Original ''[[Zondag met Lubach]]'' parody video, inspiring the ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' team to launch a Europe-wide contest to become 'second'.]]

'''Every Second Counts''' is the name under which a parody video contest amongst [[Europe]]an [[satire|satirical]] [[late-night talk show]]s was launched by [[Germany|German]] comedian [[Jan Böhmermann]]'s ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' on 2 February 2017. The goal is to ridicule U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], especially his [[Inauguration of Donald Trump#Inaugural address|inaugural statement]] that "From this day forward, it's gonna be only America ''first''! America ''first''!" by introducing one's own country with a dose of [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating humour]] and requesting to become 'second' after America.&lt;ref name="strijdt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/in-navolging-van-lubach-strijdt-heel-europa-om-second-te-worden~a4457614/ |title=In navolging van Lubach strijdt heel Europa om 'second' te worden |author=Gijs Beukers |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=3 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
{{Main|Zondag met Lubach}}
The contest was inspired by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] comedian [[Arjen Lubach]]'s show ''[[Zondag met Lubach]]'', which broadcast the parody video "The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words" on 22 January 2017.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; In the video, Trump's speeches and actions –mostly from [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his election campaign]]– are imitated and mocked by voice actor [[Greg Shapiro]],&lt;ref name="Vanity1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/donald-trump-trolling-videos-america-first-netherlands-second-greg-shapiro-shaun-streeter |title=Meet the Men Trolling Trump in Those Viral European Videos |author=Hillary Busis |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=7 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some [[self-mockery]] as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced [[America First (policy)|"America First" policy]] signifies [[isolationism]], including withdrawing U.S. support for [[NATO]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/ |title=Donald Trump's NATO Remarks Stuns U.S. Allies |author=Krishnadev Calamur  |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems [[Make America Great Again|great again]]."&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/25/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trump-hard-in-this-new-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump hard in this new ‘welcome’ video |author=Amanda Erickson |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/24/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trumps-america-first-speech-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump's 'America First' speech in 'welcome' video |author=Mark Molloy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/01/26/world/europe/ap-eu-netherlands-viral-video.html |title=Video Introducing Trump to the Netherlands Goes Viral |author=AP |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;

=== Contest launched ===
[[File:America First – Germany Second.png|280px|thumb|[[Jan Böhmermann]] launches the video contest.]]
On 2 February during ''Neo Magazin Royale'', Böhmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all [[European countries]] to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2156281-varianten-op-lubachs-introductievideo-blijven-binnenkomen.html |title=Varianten op Lubachs introductievideo blijven binnenkomen |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |date=3 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for [[Belgium]] (by ''De Ideale Wereld''), [[Switzerland]] (by ''Deville Late Night''), [[Denmark]] (by ''Natholdet''), [[Portugal]] (by ''[[5 Para A Meia-Noite]]'') and [[Lithuania]] (by ''Laikykitės ten'') had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"/&gt; Many of the videos are narrated by voice actor Shaun Streeter, with the exception of the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese versions.&lt;ref name="Vanity1"/&gt;

=== Beyond Europe ===
By 6 February, [[Italy]] (by ''Casa Surace''), [[Luxembourg]] (by ''Studio Ben''), and [[Morocco]] (a non-European country, expanding the contest further) had joined the fray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/06/513744676/if-americas-no-1-whos-no-2-european-nations-compete-for-the-uh-honor |title=If America's No. 1, Who's No. 2?

Though widely varying in contents specific to each country's presentation, and the way in which they criticise and/or ridicule President Trump and his ideas and actions, the videos often share common elements. Many revolve around (sarcastically) taking pride in or mocking their own country's history, and comparing it to Trump's actions or American history in general, and how the latter is better, equal or worse.&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sjolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilhelmer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://kurier.at/kultur/floete-mit-schoko-hoden-was-an-austria-second-alles-nicht-lustig-war/245.474.681 |title=Flöte mit Schoko-Hoden: Was an "Austria Second" alles nicht lustig war |author=Philipp Wilhelmer |work=[[Kurier]] |date=8 February 2017 |accessdate=10 February 2017 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evrydiki BA 2O37''''' ({{lang-el|Ευριδίκη ΒΑ 2Ο37}}) is a 1975 Greek-West German co-production [[black and white]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[surrealist cinema|surrealist]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]], his debut feature film.&lt;ref&gt;''Filmkunst: Zeitschrift für Filmkultur und Filmwissenschaft'', Nummer 67–79, 1975, S.

==Accolades==
Despite a lukewarm reaction by viewers, critics appreciated the innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]] and noted the originality of Nikolaidis' artistic techniques. It is characteristic that Nikolaidis himself believed ''Evrydiki BA 2O37'' to be his best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|title=Nikolaidis Nikos|website=That's Greece: Culture, Performing Arts, Cinema|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012125800/http://www.thatsgreece.com/info/culture-performing-arts-cinema-Nikos-Nikolaidis|archivedate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André Z. Labarrére and Olivier Labarrére, authors of ''Atlas du cinéma'', wrote that the film was one of the "New [[cinema of Greece|Greek Cinema]]" films that "radically transformed the panorama."&lt;ref&gt;Labarrére, André Z., y Labarrére, Olivier (2009). ''Atlas del cine'' (Título original: ''Atlas du cinéma''. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2002). Madrid: [[Ediciones Akal]]. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ThcBFxqXKTEC&amp;pg=PA275 275]. {{ISBN|8446021501}}. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this film, Nikolaidis won the Best Director Award, the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award, as well as the [[Athens]] Film Critics Association Best Picture Award at the [[Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema]] in September [[1975 in film|1975]], where Marie-Louise Bartholomew, who was involved in the production of the film, also won the Best Set Designer Award, and Andreas Andreadakis, who was involved in the editing of the film, also won the Best Editor Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=971&amp;year=1975|script-title=el:Γενικά 1975: 16ο Φεστιβάλ Ελληνικού Κινηματογράφου|website=[[Thessaloniki International Film Festival|Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης (Πληροφορίες: Βραβεία)]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Mel (1979).

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].
*[[Chuck E. Cheese's]] (U.S.-owned)
*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features.

'''Health humanities''' refers to the application of the creative or [[The arts|fine arts]] (including [[visual arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]]) and [[humanities]] disciplines (including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], [[languages]], [[law]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], etc.) to discourse about, express, and/or promote dimensions of [[human]] [[health]] and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/scope/about/|title="What is Health Humanities?"|last=|first=|date=2016|website=SCOPE: The Health Humanities Learning Lab|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applied capacity of the humanities is not itself a novel idea; however, the construct of the health humanities has only recently begun to emerge over the first decade of the 21st Century. Historically, the roots informing the health humanities can be traced back to, and can now be considered to include, such multidisciplinary areas as the [[medical humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mh.bmj.com/ |title=Medical Humanities - BMJ Journals |publisher=Mh.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies/creative arts therapies]].

In the health humanities, health (and the promotion of health) is understood according to the [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] (and other [[non-positivist]]) principles indigenous to the humanities, as opposed to the [[positivism]] of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Squier, S. M. (2007). Beyond nescience: The intersectional insights of health humanities. ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 50'' (3), 334-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emua.ac.uk/downloads/BBsept09/healthhumanities.pptx&lt;/ref&gt; The health humanities are rooted in dialogical (negotiated, intersubjective voices of multiple truths), versus monological (a singular, authoritative voice of "the" truth) perspectives on health. As such, evidence upon which health practices are based is generally considered [[Axiology|axiological]] (based in meanings, values, and aesthetics), versus [[Epistemology|epistemological]] (based in factual knowledge), in orientation. The health humanities are not an alternative to the health sciences, but rather offer a contrasting paradigm and pragmatic approach with respect to health and its promotion, and can function in a manner that is complementary and simultaneous relative to the health sciences.  

The health humanities are a growing movement internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org&lt;/ref&gt;  A conference on the health humanities was held October 13–15, 2006, at [[Green College, University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhum.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was co-organized by Judy Segal (UBC English) and Alan Richardson (UBC Philosophy) and featured presentations by Jacalyn Duffin, Carl Elliott, Nicholas King, Lorelei Lingard, Robert Proctor, Susan Squier, Andrea Tone, and Kathleen Woodward.  In January 2009, [[Paul Crawford (academic)|Paul Crawford]] became the world's first Professor of Health Humanities at [[The University of Nottingham]], and with Dr Victoria Tischler, Charley Baker, Dr Brian Brown, Dr Lisa Mooney-Smith and Professor Ronald Carter created an international health humanities initiative that included the AHRC-funded International Health Humanities Conference (IHHC). The first field description for Health Humanities was presented in the key article "Health Humanities: The future of Medical Humanities" (Crawford, Brown, Tischler, &amp; Baker, 2010), published in the Mental Health Review Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Tischler, V. &amp; Baker, C. (2010) Health Humanities: The future of medical humanities? ''Mental Health Review Journal, 15'' (3): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st International Health Humanities Conference was held 6–8 August 2010, at [[The University of Nottingham]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/IHHC-flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/First-International-Health-Humanities-Conference-Programme.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference opened with Professor Crawford's address entitled ‘Health humanities: Literature and Madness’ and included keynote lectures by Professor Kay Redfield Jamison and Professor Elaine Showalter. Mark A. Radcliffe, who also spoke at the conference, reported on 'health humanities' in his weekly column for the Nursing Times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingtimes.net/forums-blogs-ideas-debate/nursing-blogs/health-humanities-feared-by-the-bad-loved-by-the-good/5018154.article?referrer=RSS&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also reported in the Bethlem Blog.&lt;ref&gt;'Madness and Literature: Report from International Health Humanities Conference’, 16 August 2010. http://bethlemheritage.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference was hosted in the USA, 9–11 August 2012, at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, with the theme of "Music, Health, and Humanity." The 3rd International Health Humanities Conference was held 5-7 September 2014, once again at the University of Nottingham, and featured the theme of "Traumatextualities: Trauma in the Clinical, Arts and Humanities Contexts."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/blog/view/0/50&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th International Health Humanities Conference was held 30 April and 1-2 May 2015, at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, [[Anschutz Medical Campus]], [[University of Colorado]], Denver, featuring the theme of "Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics)." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BioethicsHumanities/ArtsHumanities/Pages/Health%20Humanities%20Conference.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th International Health Humanities Conference will be held 15-17 September 2016, at the [[University of Seville]], Seville, Spain, featuring the theme of "Arts and Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education, and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihhcsevilla2016.es/index?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Textbooks on the health humanities include ''Health Humanities Reader''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T., Wear, D., &amp; Friedman, L. D. (Eds.). (2014). ''Health Humanities Reader''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Health Humanities''.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Baker, C., Tischler, V., &amp; Abrams, B. (2015). ''Health Humanities''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a Health Humanities Centre was established at University College London, dedicated to research and teaching in the Health Humanities, including an MA in Health Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-humanities|title=UCL Health Humanities Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digital home ap.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-priced Panasonic Home Theatre in a Box package, which consists of the DVD player, which contains an integrated multi-channel [[power amplifier]], and a set of speakers. The consumer must buy the [[television]] and stand separately.]]
A "'''home theater in a box'''" (HTIB) is an integrated [[home cinema|home theater]] package which "bundles" together a combination  [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a [[surround sound]] decoder, a [[radio tuner]], and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a [[remote control]], a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as "2.1") and a low-frequency [[subwoofer]] cabinet.
In 2016,
they are manufactured by most makers of [[consumer electronics]]. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price "house" brands (e.g., [[Best Buy]]'s ''Insignia'' line) may be a "2.1" system. Many, however, are a full "[[5.1]]" system and some higher-end packages even have a [[7.1]] system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are [[RCA]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[LG Corp|LG]] and [[Samsung]], all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] and [[Onkyo]] make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.

==Market positioning==
HTIBs are marketed as an "all-in-one" way for consumers to enjoy the [[surround sound]] experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics "know-how" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include [[HDMI cable]]s, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.

On the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and "tweakability" of [[home cinema|home theater]] components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a [[Audio crossover|crossover]] control, a phase inversion switch, and a [[parametric equalizer]], a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too "boomy" in a room.

==Features==
A typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a [[subwoofer]]. Some HTIB systems also have a [[radio tuner]] or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. [[Spotify]]). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a [[television set]] or [[video monitor|monitor]] with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with [[HDMI]] with ARC, optical and [[SPDIF]] inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.

There are systems in this class that are sold without a [[DVD Video|DVD]] player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the "receiver-only" packages that do not come with a DVD player.

Some HTIBs use [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation.  However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by [[manufacturer]]s to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.

A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the [[surround speakers]] in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.

Some older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a [[hard disk]] for recording TV shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T.

Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Media and Communication Policy''' ('''IfM''') was founded in 2005 as an independent research institution that is exclusively dedicated to issues surrounding media and communication policies. It was established in February 2006 in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]], in November 2014 it moved to [[Cologne]]. The institute is funded by leading German public and private media organizations.

==Benefactors==
The institute is financially supported by various media organizations including [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], [[ZDF]], [[RTL Television|RTL]], [[Sky Germany]], [[Axel Springer AG]], the publishing groups [[Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck]], [[Der Spiegel]] and the [[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]] (the regional Berlin Media and Film funding organization) among others.
The Institute’s scientific advisory council consists of 25 reputable scholars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, IfM.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164651/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom gained recognition in the field through media and communication policy-related publications. 
[[Lutz Hachmeister]], a journalist and media scholar, is the founding director of the Institute. The institute has been established as a non-profit, limited liability company ([[gGmbH]]) operates independently, and has no political, party, or economic ties.

==Functions==
According to its mission statement the IfM is “a forum for the media industry, research into communication and current politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415231919/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to offer “concrete models and options for the solution of mediapolitical challenges” as well as a framework for discussing these with representatives from the political sphere. Its aim is to gain recognition for the economic and public relevance as well as the strategic significance of media policies in modern politics.
The principal task of the Institute is the continuous maintenance of an online media industry database (print-, radio-, TV- and online-media) compiling, amongst other, an annual ranking of the world’s most influential and successful media companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediadb.eu/en.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further research tasks include:
-	Establishing the theoretical and empirical foundation for a basic understanding of mediapolitical ideas and positions, as well as its specific terminologies
-	Research into the shifting correlation of print- and online media  
-	Publication and editorial supervision of the “Jahrbuch Fernsehen” (German television yearbook).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jahrbuch-fernsehen.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute established its good reputation by hosting high ranking colloquiums on media policy. Among the speakers were guests such as: [[Greg Dyke]] ([[British Film Institute]]),  [[Alan Rusbridger]] (Chief Editor of [[The Guardian]]), [[Norman Pearlstine]] (chief content officer of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]), [[Tyler Brûlé]] (founder of the [[Wallpaper*]] magazine), [[Mathias Müller von Blumencron]] and [[Georg Mascolo]] (Chief Editors of [[Der Spiegel]]), [[Ernst Uhrlau]] (President of the German Intelligence Service), [[Viviane Reding]] (EU-commissioner for information society and media), [[David Weinberger]] (fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard Law School]]), and technology scholars [[Evgeny Morozov]] and [[Geert Lovink]].
The IfM was elected one of the most important non-university institutes of media research within the framework of the programme “Germany thinks”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/med/deindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative of the [[Goethe-Institut]].

== Cologne Futures ==
Since 2012 the Institute annually organizes the Cologne Futures, until 2015 by the name Cologne Conference Futures. The conference discusses changes within the media-system - described as Media-evolution - and deals with [[Technology assessment]] in theory and practice. [[Richard Barbrook]], [[Nick Bostrom]], [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], [[Kathrin Passig]] and [[Tim Wu]] and other experts in the field gave talks on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;http://medienpolitik.eu/cologne-futures/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015 the conference is hosted in cooperation with the Academy of Media Arts Cologne. Main sponsor is the [[Deutsche Telekom]]. The talks are published and documented by the journal [http://www.medienkorrespondenz.de/ Medienkorrespondenz.]

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

An '''inventory''' is an itemized list of [[Object (museum)|objects]] that the [[museum]] has [[Accession number (library science)|accessioned]] or received via loan(s) and must be physically located by an examiner.  A complete, one-hundred percent inventory, or a random inventory of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] must be carried out periodically to ensure the museum is operating under best practices and for security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 413,415.&lt;/ref&gt;   The museum is legally responsible and ethically obligated for the maintenance of up-to-date information detailing the location of all objects within the collection, including loaned items and objects that have yet to be accessioned; this is stipulated by many museum associations, including the [http://www.aam-us.org/museumresources/ethics/coe.cfm American Association of Museums].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity ==

Although inventories require a large amount of work and are not part of the more glitzy side of museum work, their value is nonetheless extremely important.  The upkeep of the collections’ inventory record is needed for minimum collections accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Smith Finch, "The Essential Collections Inventory," in ''Registrars on Record: Essays on Museum Collection Management'', ed. Mary Case (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1988),157.&lt;/ref&gt;   Inventories provide the collections manager and or the registrar with information for insurance purposes, security, and alerts staff to possible [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]] or [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] needs of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H. Dudley, Irma Bezold Wilkinson, et al., ''Museum Registration Methods'' (Washington, D.C.: American Association of Museums, 1979), 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The completion and upkeep of and an inventory system helps to deter and aid in the early detection of theft of the collection.  The [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) urges museums to complete and maintain their inventory systems because "If a museum does not know what is in its collection, where the works are located, and the condition they are in, it, in effect, invites theft because it will have no immediate sense that an object has disappeared, and most important, it will have no descriptive information to aid the recovery of an object in the event of a theft."&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and International Committee on Museum Security, Robert B. Burke and Sam Adeloye, ed., ''A Manual of Basic Museum Security'', (Leicester, Great Britain: deVoyle, Leicester, 1986), 15-6.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;br&gt;

The type of inventory system used by a museum will be dictated by the '''Collections Management Policy (CMP)'''.  The CMP will determine how often items, what items, and how many items are to be inventory.  Museums need to periodically complete a one-hundred percent inventory of their collection, but for the period in between the completion of such an inventory, a random sampling of the collection is sufficient.  A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection.  If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections’ records is just as reliable.  However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections’ records.

An ongoing inventory method is a system that inventories on a regular basis high value items or items that are more susceptible to theft. This method resembles an iceberg, with the high value items being at the top of the iceberg.  As the inventory method progresses further down the iceberg, items of lesser value can be found.  Items found toward the center of the iceberg, need to be inventoried less than those found higher up on the berg, and more than items found below its position.  Items at the lowest position of the iceberg, below the water’s surface, may only need to be inventoried annually.&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Museums and the International Security Committee, "Protection, security and conservation of collections," in ''Collections Management'', ed. Anne Fahy (London: Routledge, 1995), 257.&lt;/ref&gt;   With this type of inventory system, the most important or most valued objects are accounted for on a regular basis.

===Review===
Inventories serve several purposes, including the opportunity for review of the '''collections department'''.  Such review includes: 
*are all objects accounted for and found to be stored properly; 
*is there any preservation or conservation issues that need to be brought to the attention of the '''registrar''', '''collections manager''', or [[curator]]; 
*is the collections’ location records reliable?  
An inventory provides a systematic review of the collections department’s records and helps to identify any problems.  How smoothly an inventory goes is actually a reflection upon the institution.  If an inventory is completed with little or no issues, then the collections department is running well; however, if many issues arise during the inventory process, this may be indicative of a collections department in need of review and change.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy H.

Every museum must complete an inventory on a regular basis and this requirement should be stated in the museum’s CMP.  The CMP should also outline the steps that need to be carried out in the inventory process, including: 
*an examination of each object and its records; 
*the condition of every object should be noted; 
*any updates to records shall be made; 
*and the inventory list will be filed in the museum’s accession file.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning and scheduling ==

Sufficient time spent in planning must be devoted before beginning such a task as an inventory.  A well thought out inventory procedure will efficiently utilize staff and their time.  Such procedure should include:
# The scope and purpose of the inventory.
# Sources of funding for staff and equipment with a commitment from management for adequate time and resources to complete the inventory.
# Resources required to complete the inventory (e.g. staff hours, computers, making and labeling equipment, imaging equipment, etc.)
# Establish a timetable for the start and completion of the inventory.
# Ascertain who will run and or carry out the inventory.
# Identify the method of approach to completing the inventory, including standards used to record findings.
# How to [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and manage information produced by the inventory and how that information will be reviewed and interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Ashby, Gordon McKenna, and Matthew Stiff, ed., ''SPECTRUM Knowledge: Standards for cultural information management'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2001), 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting an inventory ==
[[File:Cataloguing a lion head.jpg|thumb|A taxidermied lion's head displayed in the Natural History Museum, Dublin, being labelled as part of a museum inventory and cataloguing.]]

Now that inventory policy and procedure have been established, it is time to carry out the inventory.  Conducting an inventory is the final step to the inventory process, it is relatively simple in that the actions are repetitive, but it can be one of the most time consuming parts of the inventory process depending upon the size of the collection and the intended scope of the inventory. 
&lt;br&gt;

Select a method of approach when beginning the inventory process.  How will the collection be inventoried?  Shelf by shelf; or in numerical order of the catalogue?  Once the inventory method is decided, a uniformed and basic inventory record for each object needs to be created.  Such a record might contain the following:
# Object Number
# Object Name
# Brief Description of Object
# Condition (provides opportunity to conduct a condition check of the object)
# Current Location
# Notes (any other details not included in checklist, such as alerting the need for conservation treatment)
# Recorder and Date&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McKenna and Efthymia Patsatzi, ed., ''SPECTRUM: The UK Museum Documentation Standard'' (Cambridge: Museum Documentation Association, 2007), 79.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">[[File:Nasothek-2.jpg|thumb|Nasothek displaying marble body parts once used to "repair" antique statuary.]]A '''nasothek''' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|nasus}}'' "nose" and Greek {{lang|grc|θήκη}} "container") is a collection of sculpted noses. 

==Carlsberg display of restoration noses==
The [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] museum in Copenhagen has a nasothek collection that displays restored noses that were removed from portrait busts and statues after changes in the museum's [[art restoration]] policies.&lt;ref name=Huizing&gt;{{cite book|title=Klinik der menschlichen Sinne|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-76632-3|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaOg_nkDQR0C|author=E.H. Huizing|chapter=The Nose and Beyond—No Nose|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=restor&gt;{{cite book|title=History of restoration of ancient stone sculptures|year=2003|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-723-8|pages=207–224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNAVlaA6FuUC|author=Mette Moltesen|editor=Janet Burnett Grossman|chapter=Fifty years of restoration work in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noses, some made of marble and others of plaster, were all originally exhibited on the Greek and Roman statues in the glyptotek itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sign in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek under its nasothek display&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasothek.JPG|thumb|left|Detail: A closer look at the Copenhagen Nasothek display shows wide variety in surface textures and style.]]The [[Marble#Sculpture|white marble]] favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, [[iconoclasm]], or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a "restored" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Exhibition Spotlights Practices In Antiquities Conservation|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/hope_hygieia_release_040208.html|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues,  participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century "de-restoration." As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English. The English description says, "The word ''nasothek'' means a collection of noses, in analogy with ''{{linktext|discotheque}}'', a collection of records."&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The Danish explanation compares "nasotek" (Danish equivalent of "nasothek") to "{{linktext|bibliotek}}", a collection of books.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

==Lund display of plaster casts of noses==
[[File:Nya NasoteketCropped.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Display of plaster casts of noses at [[Lund University]]]]
The ''Nasoteket'' at [[Lund University]] in Sweden consists of a display of more than 100 plaster casts of noses, including a cast of the silver nose of [[Tycho Brahe]].&lt;ref name=obscura&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nose Academy|url=http://atlasobscura.com/place/nose-academy|publisher=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1830s - [[William Apess|William Appess]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who delivers “An Indian’s Looking-Glass for the White Man” and Eulogy on King Philip&lt;br/&gt; in which he states, “And while you ask yourself, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’ you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say, ‘They want what I want.’”
'''1827 and 1839 - Cherokee constitutions'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1879 - [[Thomas Tibbles]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who arranges an East coast lecture tour for the Ponca leader, Standing Bear.
'''1879 - [[Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who lectures to criticize Agency mistreatment of Paiutes.
'''1881 - Constitution of the [[Osage Nation]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:The Osage constitutional democratic government is not recognized after 1898 by the U.S.; the cause is taken up again (with mixed results) throughout the twentieth century until it is finally ended in 1997. See Warrior, The People and the Word.
'''1881 – [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], A Century of Dishonor'''&lt;br/&gt;
:“The first pro-Indian book to make a significant impact on the American reading public” ( Frederick W. Turner, “The Century after ‘A Century of Dishonor:’”)
:An appeal to the heart and conscience of the American people for repairing broken treaties, theft, and institutional termination.
'''1928 – [[Meriam Report]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Institute for Government Research report that denounces the Dawes Act, and criticizes the BIA.
'''1946 - [[Indian Claims Commission]] created'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1953 – [[Thomas Banyacya]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who writes a letter on behalf of the Hopi to President Dwight D. Eisenhower to request recognition for their claims for being conscientious objectors. Mr. Banyacya helped win an understanding with local Selective Service officials that any Hopi who requested classification as a conscientious objector would receive it.
'''1955 - [[Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1961 - The American Indian Chicago Conference''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Ninety separate communities meet at the U Chicago to critique US termination policies, and draft the Declaration of Indian Purpose.
'''1966-1995 - Blackbird Bend litigation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:In a long and bitter series of legal battles, the Omaha nation seek to regain land along the edge of their reservation. They regain a small amount. See Scherer, Imperfect Victories.
'''1969 - Alcatraz Occupation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Mobilized by ethnic studies programs at San Francisco State and UC Berkeley, Bay Area Indians allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) occupy Alcatraz island, invoking the Fort Laramie treaty of 1868 for surplus federal land to claim it for a cultural center.
'''1970 - [[N. Scott Momaday]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who gives “Man Made of Words” keynote at the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars. See Warrior, The People and the Word.

:who publishes Halfbreed, the first book by a Native Canadian women since the death of Pauline Johnson in 1913.
'''1977 - Charles Aubid''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who testifies before US District Court Judge Miles Lord. Aubid appeals to use the memory of the deceased Old John Squirrel in a case about Anishinaabeg control of the annual wild rice harvest. (Vizenor, “Aesthetics of Survivance,” Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence).
'''1980 - [[Russell Means]] “Fighting Words on the Future of the Earth,” ''Mother Jones''''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:Means critiques Marxism and calls for Lakota tradition. Importantly, he does so through the writing of someone who has recorded his speech.
'''1994 - [[Gerald Vizenor]] ''Manifest Manners'''''&lt;br/&gt;
:Vizenor formulates the concept of cultural [[survivance]]--survival and resistance--to describe Native signification.

:who is fired from Colorado University for allegations of plagiarism after publishing “"Some People Push Back": On the Justice of Roosting Chickens” (2001){{dubious|date=January 2013}}
'''2008 - Malea Powell, “Dreaming Charles Eastman: Cultural Memory, Autobiography, and Geography in Indigenous Rhetorical Histories”''' &lt;br/&gt;
:A short mixed-genre (narrative, theory, poetry) essay in which Powell grapples with being “an Indian talking about what it means to be an Indian engaged in the archive, what it means to be the object looking back, the objectified engaged in the process of making knowledge about the processes that led to my objectification” (117).

&lt;!--Basic introduction; who he is--&gt;
'''Avram Noam Chomsky''' (born December 7, 1928) is an American [[linguist]], [[philosopher]], [[cognitive scientist]], [[historian]], [[Activism|political activist]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]]. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and laureate professor at the [[University of Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MITLinguistics/posts/1547120331974705|title=MIT Linguistics|via=Facebook|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/worldrenowned-linguist-noam-chomsky-joins-ua-faculty|title=World-Renowned Linguist Noam Chomsky Joins UA Faculty|work=UANews|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

&lt;!--Early life up until 1966--&gt;
Born to middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to [[Harvard University]]'s [[Society of Fellows]]. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]]; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of [[behaviorism]], being particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].

&lt;!--Later life post-1967--&gt;
Chomsky [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|vocally opposed U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], believing the war to be an act of [[American imperialism]]. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on [[Nixon's Enemies List|Nixon's "Enemies List"]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[Linguistics Wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later co-wrote [[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|an analysis]], which articulated the [[propaganda model]] of media criticism, and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. Additionally, his defense of [[freedom of speech]]—including free speech for [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]—generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the [[War on Terror]] and supporting the [[Occupy Movement]].

&lt;!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:--&gt;
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a [[paradigm shift]]er who helped spark a [[cognitive revolution|major revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proved highly significant within the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements. Some of his critics have accused him of [[anti-Americanism]].

== Early life ==

===Childhood: 1928–45===
Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His father was [[William Chomsky|William "Zev" Chomsky]], an Ashkenazi Jew originally from [[Ukraine]] who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], William went on to become school principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia. Chomsky's mother was the Belarusian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1904–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9–10|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.|source=Biographer [[Robert F. Barsky]], 1997{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=30–31}}}}
{{external media| float = left|width = 270px| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?88099-1/noam-chomsky-life-dissent Presentation by Robert F. Barsky on ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent'', July 19, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Noam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} The brothers were close, although David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=11–13}} Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of [[Zionism]]; the family was particularly influenced by the [[Left Zionism|Left Zionist]] writings of [[Ahad Ha'am]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} As a Jew, Chomsky faced [[anti-semitism]] as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=15}}

Chomsky described his parents as "normal [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]" who had a [[centre-left politics|center-left]] position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to [[far-left politics]] through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=14|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=11, 14–15}} He was substantially influenced by his uncle who owned a newspaper stand in New York City, where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=23|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=12, 14–15, 67|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=4}} Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=23}} He later described his discovery of [[anarchism]] as "a lucky accident",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=17–19}} because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely [[Stalinism]] and other forms of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=17–19|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=16, 18}}

Chomsky's primary education was at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent [[Deweyism|Deweyite]] institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} It was here, at the age of 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the [[Catalonia Offensive|fall of Barcelona]] to [[Francisco Franco]]'s fascist army in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=13|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=21–22|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=14|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=4}} During the same time period, Chomsky attended the Hebrew High School at [[Gratz College]]. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17}}

In 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=47|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=47}} However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=17}} His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist [[Zellig Harris]], whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48–51|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] honors thesis was titled "Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}

From 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]], where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, [[J. L. Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], would strongly influence Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33–34}} In 1952, Chomsky published his first [[academic article]], "Systems of Syntactic Analysis", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on [[microfilm]] before being published in 1975 as part of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83–85|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4–5}} Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter [[national service]] in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}} [[George Armitage Miller]], a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}}

{{double image|left|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|152|The work of anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) significantly influenced the young Chomsky.}}

In 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=13, 48, 51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19}} After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the [[Allston]] area of [[Boston]], remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=20}} In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from the [[United Kingdom]] through [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] and into [[Italy]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=20–21}} On that same trip they also spent six weeks in [[Israel]] at [[Hashomer Hatzair]]'s [[HaZore'a]] Kibbutz. Although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab racism]] that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=20–21}}

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=24|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=13}} Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], and works by Marxists [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=24–25}} His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which were documented in Orwell's ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=26}} He avidly read leftist journal ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', remarking that it "answered to and developed" his interest in anarchism,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=34–35}} as well as the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', published by [[council communism|council communist]] [[Paul Mattick]]. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in ''Living Marxism'' written by [[Antonie Pannekoek]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=36–40}} He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]], an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the [[Second World War]] was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's "[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]" to crush Europe's proletariat.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=43–44}}

===Early career: 1955–66===

Chomsky had befriended two linguists at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Morris Halle]] and [[Roman Jakobson]], the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a [[mechanical translation]] project, and the other half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=86–87|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=38–40}} Chomsky had been recruited to MIT by Jerome Wiesner, an influential scientist who, at this time, was also involved in getting the US's nuclear missile program established &lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight (2018). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press., pp. x-xii, 16, 30, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Having brought such missile research to MIT, Wiesner then became a nuclear strategy adviser to both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, before returning to MIT to oversee research programmes at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 2018, pp. xi-xii; Snead, D. L. 1999. ''The Gaither Committee, Eisenhower, and the Cold War''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its military involvement, Chomsky has described MIT as "a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work."{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=87}} In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=91}} That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} and he published his first book on linguistics, ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', a work that radically opposed the dominant [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]–[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] trend in the field.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=88–91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=40|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=5}} The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused "significant upheaval" in the discipline.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=88–91}} Linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] later asserted that it "revolutionized the scientific study of language".{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=1}} From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=84}}

In 1959 he published a review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' in the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=96–99|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=41|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=5}} Opining that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics, his review helped him to become an "established intellectual",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=119}} and he proceeded to found MIT's Graduate Program in linguistics with Halle. In 1961 he was awarded [[academic tenure]], being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=101–102, 119|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=23}} He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth [[International Congress of Linguists]], held in 1962 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which established him as the ''de facto'' spokesperson of American linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=102}} He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1966), ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar'' (1966), and ''[[Cartesian linguistics|Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought]]'' (1966).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=103}} Along with Halle, he also edited the ''Studies in Language'' series of books for [[Harper and Row]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=104}} and extended the theory of generative grammar to [[phonology]] in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://libraries.mit.edu/chomsky/slideshow/#active=1&amp;slide=b4 |title=Slideshow {{!}} unBox the Chomsky Archive |publisher= MIT  |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the [[Linguistics Society of America]] Professor at the [[University of California]], and then as the Beckman Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as ''Language and Mind'' in 1968.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=122}} In this period, military scientists were also interested in Chomsky's linguistics. As former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, said: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop … languages for computer operations in military command and control systems."&lt;ref&gt;A. Debons, 'Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact', in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354; A. Newell in G. Bugliarello (ed.), ''Bioengineering: An Engineering View'', San Francisco 1968, p271.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky was a consultant for a military sponsored project "to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control." One of Chomsky's students who also worked on this project, [[Barbara Partee]], says that this research was justified to the military on the basis that "in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html 'When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky’s Linguistics for their Weapons Systems'], ''3 Quarks Daily'', 12 March 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf ‘Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples’], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scientists eventually found Chomsky's theories unworkable for their computer systems. Other subsequent difficulties with the theories led to various debates between Chomsky and his critics that came to be known as the "[[Linguistics Wars]]", although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=60–61}}

==Later life==

===Anti-Vietnam War activism and rise to prominence: 1967–75===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=[I]t does not require very far-reaching, specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam. And, in fact, to take apart the system of illusions and deception which functions to prevent understanding of contemporary reality [is] not a task that requires extraordinary skill or understanding. It requires the kind of normal skepticism and willingness to apply one's analytical skills that almost all people have and that they can exercise.|source=Chomsky on the Vietnam War{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=114}}}}

Chomsky first involved himself in active political protest against U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=78}} However, it was not until 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=120}} In February he published a widely read essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=122|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=83}} He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, ''[[American Power and the New Mandarins]],'' which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=122–123|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=83}} His other political books of the time included ''At War with Asia'' (1971), ''The Backroom Boys'' (1973), ''For Reasons of State'' (1973), and ''Peace in the Middle East?'' (1975), published by [[Pantheon Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xvi–xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=163|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=87}} Coming to be associated with the American [[New Left]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=123}} he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Erich Fromm]], and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=134–135}} Although ''The New York Review of Books'' did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change put a stop to it,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=162–163|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=87}} he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=162–163}}

Along with his writings, Chomsky also became actively involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside [[the Pentagon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129}} During this time, Chomsky, along with [[Mitchell Goodman]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[William Sloane Coffin]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], also founded the anti-war collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=80–81}} Although he questioned the objectives of the [[1968 student protests]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=121–122, 131}} Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated [[political science]] department.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=121|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=78}}

During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, "a good deal of [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus".&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael (2006). ''Remembering Tomorrow: From the politics of opposition to what we are for'', Seven Stories Press, pp. 97–99; C. P. Otero (1988). ''Noam Chomsky: Language and politics'', Black Rose, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As Chomsky elaborates, "[MIT was] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab&amp;nbsp;... the Research Laboratory for Electronics."&lt;ref&gt;White, G. D. (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books, pp. 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning "to stop the war research" at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shalom, [http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue23/shalom23.htm "Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert F. Barsky"], ''New Politics'', NS6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved October 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 121–122, 140-141; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that "should not have happened." However, Chomsky has also claimed that MIT has "quite a good record on civil liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Albert 2006, pp. 107–108; Knight 2016, pp. 36–38, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chomsky visited the Vietnamese city of [[Hanoi]] to give a lecture at the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]]; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the [[War Resisters League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=153|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=24–25, 84–85}}

[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|President [[Richard Nixon]] placed Chomsky on his "Enemies List".]]

As a result of his anti-war activism, Chomsky was ultimately arrested on multiple occasions, and U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] included him on the [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|master version]] of his [[Nixon's Enemies List|"Enemies List"]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=80}} He was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, and his wife began studying for her own Ph.D. in linguistics in order to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or loss of employment.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=123–124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} However, MIT – despite being under some pressure to do so – refused to fire him due to his influential standing in the field of linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} His work in this area continued to gain international recognition; in 1967 he received honorary doctorates from both the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Chicago]][[Doctor of Humane Letters|.]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} In 1970, [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] and [[Swarthmore College]] also awarded him honorary D.H.L.'s, as did [[Bard College]] in 1971, [[Delhi University]] in 1972, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=143}}

In 1971 Chomsky gave the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lectures at the [[University of Cambridge]], which were published as ''Problems of Knowledge and Freedom'' later that year. He also delivered the [[Whidden Lectures]] at [[McMaster University]], the [[Huizinga Lecture]] at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, the Woodbridge Lectures at [[Columbia University]], and the Kant Lectures at [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}} In 1971 he partook in a [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] on Dutch television, entitled ''Human Nature: Justice versus Power''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=52|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=222}} Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of [[post-modernism]] and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid the cause of the working-classes{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=53}} and lambasting France as having "a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=192–195}} Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing ''Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar'' (1972),{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} an enlarged edition of ''Language and Mind'' (1972),{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} and ''Reflections on Language'' (1975).{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}}

===Edward Herman and the Faurisson affair: 1976–80===
{{See also|Cambodian genocide denial#Chomsky and Herman|Faurisson affair}}
[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|left|Noam Chomsky (1977)]]
Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=175}} His public talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized actions of the Israeli government and military,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=167, 170}} and his political views came under attack from right-wing and centrist figures, the most prominent of whom was [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Chomsky considered Dershowitz "a complete liar" and accused him of actively misrepresenting his position on issues.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170–171}}  During the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with [[Edward S. Herman]], who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=157}} Together they authored ''[[Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda]]'', a book which criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher [[Warner Modular]] initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160–162|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}}

While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from [[Michael Albert]]'s [[South End Press]], an activist-oriented publishing company.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=85}}
In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised ''Counter-Revolutionary Violence'' and published it with South End Press as the two-volume ''[[The Political Economy of Human Rights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=187|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}} In this they compared U.S. media reactions to the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Cambodian genocide]] and the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=187}}&lt;ref&gt;This Chomsky-Herman thesis has been challenged by Sophal Ear, who "argues that concurrent [media] coverage of human rights violations in right-wing regimes in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] and [[South Korea]] exceeded the coverage given to Cambodia" during the genocide: See {{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Bruce |url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm |title=Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodia Controversy |website=Mekong.net |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject in front of the [[United Nations]]' [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in [[Lisbon]] in 1979.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=103}} The following year, the Marxist academic, [[Steven Lukes]] authored an article for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/files/lukes_chomsky_debate_1980_1981-2_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukes completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work. The controversy damaged his reputation,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=187–189}} and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=190}}

Although Chomsky had long publicly criticized [[Nazism]] and [[totalitarianism]] more generally, his commitment to [[freedom of speech]] led him to defend the right of French historian [[Robert Faurisson]] to advocate a position widely characterized as [[Holocaust denial]]. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for the historian's freedom of speech was published as the preface to Faurisson's 1980 book ''Mémoire en défense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=179–180|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=185|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=184}} Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist [[Werner Cohn]] later published an analysis of the affair titled ''Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers''.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=78}} The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=185}} and Chomsky did not visit France, where the translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |title=Chomsky à Paris: chronique d'un malentendu |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2010/06/03/chomsky-a-paris-chronique-d-un-malentendu_1367002_3260.html |work=Le Monde des Livres |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for almost thirty years following the debacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aeschimann |first=Eric |title=Chomsky s'est exposé, il est donc une cible désignée |url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101638536-chomsky-s-est-expose-il-est-donc-une-cible-designee |work=Liberátion |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaganite era and work on the media: 1980–89===

The election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] to the U.S. Presidency in 1980 marked a period of increased military intervention in [[Central America]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=90–91}} In 1985, during [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Nicaragua's Contra War]] – in which the U.S. supported the [[Contras|Contra militia]] against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government – Chomsky travelled to [[Managua]] to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=91, 92}} Many of these lectures would be published in 1987 as ''On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=91}} In 1983 he published ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'', an examination of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and the place of the U.S. within it, arguing that the U.S. had continually used the conflict for its own ends.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=99|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=13}} In 1988, Chomsky then visited the [[Palestinian territories]] to witness the impact of Israeli military occupation.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=98}}

In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published ''[[Manufacturing Consent|Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', in which they outlined their [[propaganda model]] for understanding the mainstream media; there they argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news provided was censored through four filters which had a great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160, 202|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=127–134}} The book was adapted into a 1992 film, ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', which was directed by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Peter Wintonick]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=136}} In 1989, Chomsky published ''[[Necessary Illusions|Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies]],'' in which he critiqued what he sees as the pseudo-democratic nature of Western capitalist states.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=138–139}}

By the 1980s, a number of Chomsky's students had become leading linguistic specialists in their own right, expanding, revising, and expanding on Chomsky's ideas of generative grammar.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=53}} By the end of the 1980s, Chomsky had established himself as a globally recognized figure.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=59}}

===Increased political activism: 1990–present===

In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=214}} Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the [[East Timorese Relief Association]] and the [[National Council for East Timorese Resistance]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as ''Powers and Prospects'' in 1996.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist [[John Pilger]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=107}} After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led [[International Force for East Timor]] arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the [[Timor Gap Treaty]]. {{Sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=109–110}} Chomsky's book ''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order'' was a [[Boston Globe]] and Voice Literary Supplement bestseller in 1999.

[[File:Noam Chomsky WSF - 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky at the [[World Social Forum]] ([[Porto Alegre]]) in 2003]]

Chomsky retired from full-time teaching,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}} although as an [[Emeritus]] he nevertheless continued to conduct research and seminars at MIT.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed, with these interviews being collated and published by [[Seven Stories Press]] in October.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=110–111}}
Chomsky argued that the ensuing [[War on Terror]] was not a new development, but rather a continuation of the same U.S. foreign policy and its concomitant rhetoric that had been pursued since at least the Reagan era of the 1980s.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=143}} In 2003 he published ''[[Hegemony or Survival]]'', in which he articulated what he called the United States' "imperial grand strategy" and critiqued the [[Iraq War]] and other aspects of the 'War on Terror.'{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=114–118}}

Chomsky toured the world with increasing regularity during this period, giving talks on various subjects.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2001 he gave the [[D.T. Lakdawala]] Memorial Lecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/11/04/stories/0204000j.htm U.S., Britain ignored 'culture of terrorism': Chomsky], ''[[The Hindu]]'' November 4, 2001. Retrieved 21 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Delhi]], India, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the [[Latin American Association of Social Scientists]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2002 Chomsky visited Turkey in order to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a [[co-defendant]] and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the prosecution on the first day.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} During that trip, Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favour of the Kurds' [[human rights]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} A supporter of the [[World Social Forum]], he attended their conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=112–113, 120}}

His wife, Carol, died in December 2008.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky Toronto 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Chomsky speaking in support of the [[Occupy movement]] in 2011]]

Chomsky was drawn to the energy and activism of the [[Occupy movement]], delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence, first [[Occupy (Chomsky book)|''Occupy'']] a pamphlet, in 2012, then, in 2013, ''Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity''. Both were published by [[Zuccotti Park Press]]. His analysis included a critique that attributed Occupy's growth as a response to a perceived abandonment of the interests of the white working class by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jul/06/noam-chomsky-occupy-movement-spark-video |title=Noam Chomsky: 'The Occupy movement just lit a spark' – video |last=Younge |first=Gary |date=July 6, 2012 |last2=Hogue |first2=Kat Keene |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |last3=theguardian.com|access-date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Chomsky joined the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] advisory council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noam Chomsky Joins NAPF Advisory Council |url=https://www.wagingpeace.org/noam-chomsky-joins-napf-advisory-council/ |website=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a senior fellow there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Joe |title=Tickets on sale for Tucson talk on nuclear war with Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://tucson.com/news/local/tickets-on-sale-for-tucson-talk-on-nuclear-war-with/article_66bf8396-1b21-5af5-9843-79bcbf551fd0.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for [[Vermont]] U.S. senator [[Bernie Sanders]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |title=Inside the mind of Bernie Sanders: unbowed, unchanged, and unafraid of a good fight |work=The Guardian |date=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082624/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Paul |last=Lewis |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Chomsky was publicly rebuked by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] of Turkey after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning the Turkish leader for his [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and for holding double standards on terrorism.&lt;ref name="erdogan"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chomsky hits back at Erdoğan, accusing him of double standards on terrorism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/chomsky-hits-back-erdogan-double-standards-terrorism-bomb-istanbul |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 14, 2016|access-date =January 14, 2016 |issn= |language= |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky accused Erdoğan of [[hypocrisy]] and added that the Turkish president supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-crisis-turkey-and-saudi-arabia-shock-western-countries-by-supporting-antiassad-jihadists-10242747.html |title=Turkey and Saudi Arabia alarm the West by backing Islamist extremists the Americans had bombed in Syria |author=Sengupta, Kim |newspaper=The Independent |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="erdogan" /&gt; Chomsky also criticized the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and U.S. involvement in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], highlighting that Saudi has "one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/5/17/chomsky_saudi_arabia_is_the_center |title=Chomsky: Saudi Arabia is the "Center of Radical Islamic Extremism" Now Spreading Among Sunni Muslims |date=May 17, 2016 |newspaper=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Chomsky called [[Donald Trump]] an "ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac" and a "greater evil" than Hillary Clinton. Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: "It's possible, but it's a kind of strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been [[Foreign electoral intervention|interfering]] with, and undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/153594128485/noam-chomsky-speaks-with-upfront-slams-media Noam Chomsky speaks with ‘Upfront’ – slams media coverage, criticises third party voters]".

The basis to Chomsky's linguistic theory is rooted in [[biolinguistics]], holding that the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined in the human mind and hence genetically transmitted.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=4|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}} He therefore argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=7}} In adopting this position, Chomsky rejects the [[radical behaviorism|radical behaviorist]] psychology of B.&amp;nbsp;F.

===Universal grammar===
{{Main|Universal grammar}}

Since the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones which have never before been uttered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/noam-chomskys-theory-universal-grammar-right-its-hardwired-our-brains-364236 |title=Noam Chomsky's Theory Of Universal Grammar Is Right; It's Hardwired Into Our Brains |date=2015-12-07 |work=Medical Daily|access-date=2017-08-04 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute "universal grammar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chomsky, Noam |url=https://chomsky.info/architecture01/ |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thornbury |first1=Scott |title=An A–Z of ELT (Methodology) |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/mit-claims-to-have-found-a-language-universal-that-ties-all-languages-together/ |title=MIT claims to have found a "language universal" that ties all languages together |newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformational generative grammar===
{{Main|Transformational generative grammar}}

Beginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' (1957), a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955), Chomsky challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans-title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: Lingvistički časopis |volume=6 |issue=12–13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |id={{ZDB|1080348-8}} |archivedate=September 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |accessdate=May 15, 2015}} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1941130086 (CROLIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures. [[Surface structure]] 'faces out' and is represented by spoken utterances, while [[deep structure]] 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a [[generative grammar]] (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.&lt;ref name="MTCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |url=https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015800/https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |via=chomsky.info |accessdate=December 18, 2017 |first=Zoltán Gendler |last=Szabó |publisher=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, 1860–1960|editor-first = Ernest|editor-last = LePore |year=2004 |location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chomsky hierarchy===
{{Main|Chomsky hierarchy}}

The Chomsky hierarchy, sometimes referred to as the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy, is a containment hierarchy of classes of [[formal grammars]]. The hierarchy imposes a logical structure across different language classes and provides a basis for understanding the relationship between grammars (devices that enumerate the valid sentences within languages). In order of increasing expressive power it includes [[regular grammar|regular (or Type-3) grammars]], [[context-free grammar|context-free (or Type-2) grammars]], [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive (or Type-1) grammars]], and [[formal grammar|recursively enumerable (or Type-0) grammars]]. Each class is a strict subset of the class above it, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of [[formal languages]] (infinite sets of strings composed from finite sets of symbols, or alphabets) than the one below.&lt;ref name=":522"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.wmich.edu/~bhardin/cs4850/ChomskyPresentation.pdf |title=The Chomsky Hierarchy |publisher=cs.wmich.edu |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |author=Robert Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being important in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy is also relevant in [[theoretical computer science]], especially in [[programming language theory]],&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Papers on Computer Languages |date=2002 |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information |isbn=978-1-57586-381-8 |chapter=Preface |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[compiler]] construction, and [[automata theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computability, complexity, and languages: fundamentals of theoretical computer science |last2=Weyuker |first2=Elaine J. |last3=Sigal |first3=Ron |publisher=Academic Press, Harcourt, Brace |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-12-206382-4 |edition=2nd |location=Boston |page=327| author-link2 = Elaine Weyuker |last1=Davis |first1=Martin| author-link1 = Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist program===
{{Main|Minimalist program}}
Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's research has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or '[[Logical form (linguistics)|logical forms]]'.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt; When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior research has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to ''create'' these rules.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The second major area to which Chomsky has contributed—and surely the best known in terms of the number of people in his audience and the ease of understanding what he writes and says—is his work on sociopolitical analysis; political, social, and economic history; and critical assessment of current political circumstance.

In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]], who use corporate media, advertising, and [[think tanks]] to promote their own [[propaganda]]. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth that they obscure.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=8|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=158}} He believes that "[[common sense]]" is all that is required to break through the web of falsehood and see the truth, if it (common sense) is employed using both [[critical thinking]] skills and an awareness of the role that self-interest and self-deception plays both on oneself and on others.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=74|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=12–13}} He believes that it is the moral responsibility of intellectuals to tell the truth about the world, but claims that few do so because they fear losing prestige and funding.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

Although he had joined protest marches and organized activist groups, he identifies his primarily political outlet as being that of education, offering free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=71}} His political writings have covered a wide range of topics, although there are a number of core themes throughout much of his work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=158}} He is a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] international union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/biography |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |title=IWW Biography |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022105/http://www.iww.org/history/biography |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the interim consultative committee of the [[International Organization for a Participatory Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iopsociety.org/interim-committee International Organization for a Participatory Society—Interim Committee] Retrieved March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States foreign policy ===
[[File:Dussel and Chomsky.jpg|thumb|Chomsky and [[Enrique Dussel]], who left Argentina in reaction to the U.S.-backed [[Dirty War]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]
Chomsky has been a prominent critic of U.S. [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Milne, Seumas, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/07/noam-chomsky-us-foreign-policy "'US foreign policy is straight out of the mafia'"], ''The Guardian'', November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His published work has focused heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}} such as the U.S.-backed [[state terror]] campaign against left-wing dissidents across Latin America known as [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200412__/ On Colombia: Noam Chomsky, introduction to Doug Stokes ''America’s Other War: Terrorizing Colombia'', Zed, December 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believes that the basic principle of the [[foreign policy of the United States]] is the establishment of "open societies" that are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=92}} He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}}
He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the [[British Empire]] in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}

Chomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}

He has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel–Palestine conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the [[Levant]] that is home to both Jews and Arabs.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=170|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=76–77|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=159}} However, acknowledging the [[realpolitik]] of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a [[two-state solution]] on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=97|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=159}} As a result of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Chomsky and the Middle East|his criticisms of Israel]], Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/israel-noam-chomsky-palestinian-west-bank |title=Noam Chomsky barred by Israelis from lecturing in Palestinian West Bank |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=May 16, 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/middleeast/18chomsky.html |title=Israel Roiled After Chomsky Barred From West Bank |last=Bronner |first=Ethan |date=May 17, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/05/201051904343834346.html |title=Israel: Chomsky ban 'big mistake' |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/17/denied_entry_israel_blocks_noam_chomsky |title=Denied Entry: Israel Blocks Noam Chomsky from Entering West Bank to Deliver Speech |publisher=Democracy Now!|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html |title=Noam Chomsky Denied Entry To Israel |date=January 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114172540/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html|archive-date=January 14, 2016|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitalism and socialism===
[[File:Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, MIT (14112575810).jpg|thumb|Chomsky speaking at [[Chatham House]], London, May 2014]]
In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of [[capitalism]] and the [[selfishness|selfish]] pursuit of material advancement.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=15}} At the same time, he developed a disdain for the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy on the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164–165}} He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to [[Ruling class|ruling elites]], among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Socialism will be achieved only insofar as all social institutions—in particular, the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a modern society—are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial republic of the sort that Russell and others envisioned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, will be "a direct participator in the government of affairs."|source=Noam Chomsky{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} }}

Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods financial control]] agreements.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14–15}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Noting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Chomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around "nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}}
He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the [[means of production]], with society governed by [[workers' council]]s, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} In this, he believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=201–202}}

=== News media and propaganda ===
{{Main|Propaganda model}}
Chomsky's political writings have largely been focused on the two concepts of [[ideology]] and [[power (social and political)|power]], or the media and state policy.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=20}} One of Chomsky's best-known works, ''Manufacturing Consent'', dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, from government-guided "free market" forces, is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37–38}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}} As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres perpetrated in [[Nicaragua]] by the U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179–182}}
To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}

Chomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about  [[policy|policy formation]] in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=70}} He does not dismiss [[conspiracy theories]] outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging [[power (social and political)|power]] in a substantial way.
In response to the labeling of his own thoughts as "conspiracy theory", Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=42}}

==Philosophy==
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=Chomsky's intellectual life had been divided between his work in linguistics and his political activism, philosophy coming as a distant third. Nonetheless, his influence among analytic philosophers has been enormous&amp;nbsp;... he has persistently defended his views against all takers, engaging in important debates with many of the major figures in analytic philosophy throughout his career.|source=Zoltán Gendler Szabó, 2004&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;}}

Chomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[philosophy of language]], and the [[philosophy of science]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}} In these fields he has been highly critical of many other philosophers, in particular those operating within the field of [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}}

==Personal life==

Despite having been raised Jewish, Chomsky is currently [[Irreligious|non-religious]], although he has expressed approval of forms of religion such as [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=69}} He is known for his "dry, laconic wit",{{attribution needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} and for the use of [[irony]] in his writings,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=162}} and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms such as "corrupt", "fascist", and "fraudulent".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} Chomsky's colleague [[Steven Pinker]] has said that he "portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/society.politics |title=The Guardian Profile: Noam Chomsky |last=Jaggi |first=Maya |authorlink=Maya Jaggi |date=January 20, 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky avoids attending [[academic conferences]], including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=169}}

==Reception and influence==

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=[Chomsky's] voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy: from computer science to neuroscience, from anthropology to education, mathematics and literary criticism. If we include Chomsky's political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action.|source=Sperlich, 2006{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=60}}}}
Chomsky's legacy is as both a "leader in the field" of linguistics and "a figure of enlightenment and inspiration" for [[political dissent]]ers.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=191}} Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in him being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being "on the outer margin of acceptability."{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=24}}

===In academia===

Linguist John Lyons remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become "the most dynamic and influential" school of thought in the field.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=2}} By the 1970s, his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=42}} while a poll conducted by [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Minnesota State University]] found ''Syntactic Structures'' to be the single most important work in the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/cogsci100.htm |publisher=web.mnstate.edu |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his work in [[automata theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and the Chomsky hierarchy has become well known in [[computer science]], and he is much cited within the field of [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Sipser |author=Sipser, Michael |year=1997 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation |publisher=PWS Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-94728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Knuth: Selected Papers on Computer Languages |url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cl.html |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's work contributed substantially to the decline of [[behaviorist psychology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 6: Evolutionary Psychology, Problem Solving, and 'Machiavellian' Intelligence |publisher=Massey University |website=School of Psychology |year=1996 |url=http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117055247/http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Radick |title=The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, [[Niels Kaj Jerne]], used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating "components of a generative grammar&amp;nbsp;... with various features of protein structures". The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel Lecture was "The Generative Grammar of the Immune System".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf |title=The Generative Grammar of the Immune System |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=19 August 2013 |author=Niels K.

Despite their respect for his intellectual contribution, a number of linguists and philosophers have been very critical of Chomsky's approach to language. These critics include Christina Behme, Cedric Boeckx, [[Margaret Boden]], Rudolph Botha, [[Vyvyan Evans]], [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]], [[Daniel Everett]], [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]], Anna Kinsella, [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], [[Stephen Levinson]], Bruce Nevin, [[Geoffrey K.

Chomsky's approach to academic freedom has led him to give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that [[Walt Rostow]], a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened "to protest publicly" if Rostow was "denied a position at MIT". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser [[John Deutch]] wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, ''The New York Times'' quoted Chomsky as saying, "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met.... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him."&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 140–141; Noam Chomsky (1996). ''Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian''.

Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes the linguist and activist as "one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} while journalist [[John Pilger]] described him as a "genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom.

However, Sperlich notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153–154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so or not.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics "do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24939">The '''Older Dryas''' was a [[stadial]] (cold) period between the [[Bølling oscillation|Bølling]] and [[Allerød oscillation|Allerød]] [[interstadial]]s (warmer phases), about 14,000 years [[Before Present]]), towards the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Its date is not well defined, with estimates varying by 400 years, but its duration is agreed to have been around 200 years.

The gradual warming since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (27,000 to 24,000 years BP) has been interrupted by two cold spells: the Older Dryas and the [[Younger Dryas]] (c. 12,900-11,650 BP). In northern [[Scotland]], the glaciers were thicker and deeper during the Older Dryas than the succeeding Younger Dryas, and there is no evidence of human occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World|first1=Paul|last1=Pettit|first2=Mark|last2=White|pages=374 477|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-67455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northwestern Europe]] was also an earlier [[Oldest Dryas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Allaby|title=Oxford Dictionary of Geology &amp; Earth Sciences|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=181|year=2013|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-19-965306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dryas are named after an indicator genus, the Arctic and Alpine plant [[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]], the remains of which are found in higher concentrations in deposits from colder periods.

The Older Dryas was a variable cold, dry [[Blytt-Sernander]] period, observed in climatological evidence in only some regions, depending on latitude. In regions in which it is not observed, the Bølling-Allerød is considered a single interstadial period. Evidence of the Older Dryas is strongest in northern Eurasia, particularly part of Northern [[Prehistoric Europe|Europe]], roughly equivalent to [[Pollen zone]] Ic.

==Dates==
In the [[Greenland]] oxygen isotope record, the Older Dryas appears as a downward peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød. That configuration presents a difficulty in estimating its time, as it is more of a point than a segment. The segment is small enough to escape the resolution of most carbon-14 series, as the points are not close enough together to find the segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.full Perry, Charles A., Hsu, Kenneth A.; Geophysical, archaeological, and historical evidence support a solar-output model for climate change]. Section: Model Timeline Calibration, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to the problem assigns a point and then picks an arbitrary segment. The Older Dryas is sometimes considered to be "centered" near 14,100 BP or to be 100 to 150 years long "at" 14,250 BP.

A second approach finds carbon-14 or other dates as close to the end of the Bølling and the beginning of the Allerød as possible and then selects endpoints that based on them: for example, 14,000-13,700 BP.

The best approach attempts to include the Older Dryas in a sequence of points as close together as possible (high resolution) or within a known event.

For example, pollen from the island of [[Hokkaidō]], [[Japan]], records a [[Larix]] pollen peak and matching [[sphagnum]] decline at 14,600-13700 BP. In the [[White Sea]], a cooling occurred at 14,700-13,400/13,000, which resulted in a re-advance of the glacier in the initial Allerød. In [[Canada]], the [[Shulie Lake]] phase, a re-advance, is dated to 14,000-13,500 BP. On the other hand, [[varve]] chronology in southern [[Sweden]] indicates a range of 14,050-13,900 BP.&lt;ref&gt;Edwige Pons-Branchu, Climatic control on speleothems growth. High precision U/Th dating of speleothems from South and East of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capturing the Older Dryas by high resolution continues to be of interest to climatologists.

==Description==
[[Northern Europe]] offered an alternation of [[steppe]] and [[tundra]] environments depending on the [[permafrost]] line and the [[latitude]]. In moister regions, around lakes and streams, were thickets of [[dwarf birch]], [[willow]], [[sea buckthorn]], and [[juniper]]. In the river valleys and uplands, to the south, were open [[birch]] forests.

The first trees, birch and [[pine]], had spread into Northern Europe 500 years earlier. During the Older Dryas, the glacier re-advanced, and the trees retreated southward, to be replaced by a mixture of grassland and cool-weather alpine species. The [[biome]] has been called "[[Park Tundra]]," "Arctic tundra," "Arctic pioneer vegetation," or “birch woodlands." It is now in the transition between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]] in [[Siberia]]. Then, it stretched from Siberia to [[Great Britain]], in a more-or-less unbroken expanse.

To the northwest was the [[Baltic ice lake]], which was truncated by the edge of the glacier. Species had access to [[Denmark]] and southern Sweden. Most of [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic countries]] were under the ice or the lake for most of the period. Northern [[Scandinavia]] was glaciated. Between Britain and the [[Continental Europe]] were rolling hills prolifically populated with animals. Thousands of specimens, hundreds of tons of bones, have been recovered from the bottom of the [[North Sea]], called "[[Doggerland]]," and they continue to be recovered.

There are many more species found for the period than in this article. Most families were more diverse than they are today, and they were yet more so in the last interglacial. A great [[extinction]], especially of mammals, continued throughout the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and it may be continuing today.

== Evidence ==
The Older Dryas is a period of cooling during the [[Bølling-Allerød warming]], estimated to be from 13,900 to 13,600 years before present (BP),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klitgaard-Kristensen|first=Dorthe|last2=Sejrup|first2=H.

Numerous studies on chronology and palaeoclimate of last deglaciation show a cooling event within [[Bølling-Allerød warming]] that reflects the occurrence of Older Dryas. The determination of paleotemperatures varies from study to study depending on the sample collected. [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="interstadial"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements are most common when analyzing Ice core samples whereas the changing abundance pattern of fauna and flora are most commonly used when examining lake sediments. Moraine belts are usually studied in places with palaeoglacier presented. As for ocean sediments, the variations of alkenone levels and faunal abundances were measured to model paleotemperatures in separate studies showed in the following sections.&lt;ref name="ruan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruan|first=Jiaping|date=2015-05-15|others=et al.|title=A high resolution record of sea surface temperature in southern Okinawa Trough for the past 15,000 years|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018215001297|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|language=en|volume=426|pages=209–215|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.03.007|issn=0031-0182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake sediment evidence ===
A multi-proxy study on late glacial lake sediments of Moervaart palaeolake shows multiple pieces of evidence in various aspects to support Older Dryas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J. A.|date=2017|others=et al.|title=Multiple oscillations during the Lateglacial as recorded in a multi-proxy, high-resolution record of the Moervaart palaeolake (NW Belgium)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117300148|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=162|pages=|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake sediment had an erosional surface prior to Older Dryas suggesting a change to colder climate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Microstructure observation of the sediments shows that fossil soil wedges or frost cracks were observed in the top of Older Dryas deposits,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which indicates mean annual air temperatures below -1 to 0 ℃ and cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maarleveld|first=G.C.|date=1976|title=Periglacial phenomena and the mean annual temperature during the last glacial time in The Netherlands|url=|journal=Biuletyn Peryglacjalny|volume=26|pages=57–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is also supported by the presence of ''[[Juniper]]us'', which indicates a protecting snow cover in winter. This change is also shown on the records at the Rieme sites on the Great SandRidge of Maldegem-Stekene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J. A.|date=2013|title=The influence of environmental changes on local and regional vegetation patterns at Rieme (NW Belgium): implications for Final Palaeolithic habitation|url=|journal=Veget. Hist. Archaeobot.|volume=22|pages=17–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Snellegem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denys|first=L.|date=1991|title=Palaeolimnological aspects of a late-glacial shallow lake in sandy Flanders.|url=|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=214|pages=273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in NW Belgium, and many other sites in north-western Europe.

[[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements show a decreasing trend in [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="Greenland"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] at the transition to the Older Dryas, which corresponds to the ice core record of precipitation in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pollen analysis shows a temporary decrease in the pollen levels of trees and shrubs with a short-term increase of herbaceous pollen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changed pollen pattern suggests an increased abundance of grass as well as a retreat of tree and shrubs. The change of vegetation distribution further indicates a colder and drier climate during this period. As for aquatic plant evidence, both aquatic and semi-aquatic botanical taxa show a sharp decrease, suggesting lower lake levels caused by drier climate. The drier climate is also reflected by increased salinity indicated by diatom analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The change of Chironomids population also indicates a colder climate. ''Microtendipes'' is an indicator of intermediate temperature in Late glacial deposits in northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Stephen J.|last2=Birks|first2=H.J.B|date=2001|title=Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Lateglacial and Holocene sites in north-west Europe: Progress and problems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0277-3791(01)00038-5|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=20|issue=16-17|pages=1723–1741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Brooks and Birks, 2001).  The abundance of ''Microtendipes'' peaked in the early part of Older Dryas suggesting a cold oscillation. The mollusc data (''[[Valvata piscinalis]]'' as a cold-water indicator) suggests a lower summer temperature comparing to previous Bølling period.

=== Ocean sediment evidence ===
Recent research on sea surface temperature (SST) for the past 15,000 years in southern Okinawa modelled the Paleoclimate of ocean sediment core (ODP 1202B) using an alkenone analysis.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt; The results show a cooing stage at 14,300 to 13,700 years BP between [[Bølling-Allerød warming|Bølling and Allerød warm phases]], corresponding to the Older Dryas event.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt;

Another study on an ocean sediment core from Norwegian Trench also suggests a cooling between Bølling and Allerød warm phases. The glacial polar faunal study on ocean sediment core Troll 3.1 based on ''Neogloboquadrina pachyderma'' abundances &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Be´|first=A.W.H.|last2=Tolderlund|first2=D.S.|date=1971|title=Distribution and ecology of living planktonic foraminifera in surface waters of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cNutoYzqkY8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Distribution+and+ecology+of+living+planktonic+foraminifera+in+surface+waters+of+the+Atlantic+and+Indian+Oceans&amp;ots=0SALg44J3K&amp;sig=RYw_787yRepK85CKKLqZJYpRO2s#v=onepage&amp;q=Distribution%20and%20ecology%20of%20living%20planktonic%20foraminifera%20in%20surface%20waters%20of%20the%20Atlantic%20and%20Indian%20Oceans&amp;f=false|journal=The Micropaleontology of Oceans|volume=|pages=105–149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=T. B.|date=|title=Paleoclimatology and paleoceanography of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas: glacial-interglacial contrasts|url=|journal=Boreas|volume=9|pages=115–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there were two cooling events before Younger Dryas in which one of the events occurred within Bølling-Allerød interstadial and can be associated with Older Dryas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Scott J.|last2=Keigwin|first2=Lloyd D.|date=April 1992|title=Sudden changes in North Atlantic circulation during the last deglaciation|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/356757a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=356|issue=6372|pages=757–762|doi=10.1038/356757a0|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moraine evidence ===
The study on late-glacial climate change in White Mountains (New Hampshire, USA) refined the deglaciation history of White Mountain Moraine System (WMMS) by mapping moraine belts and related lake sequences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Woodrow B.|last2=Dorion|first2=Christopher C.|last3=Ridge|first3=John C.|last4=Balco|first4=Greg|last5=Fowler|first5=Brian K.|last6=Svendsen|first6=Kristen M.|date=Jan 2017|title=Deglaciation and late-glacial climate change in the White Mountains, New Hampshire, USA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/div-classtitledeglaciation-and-late-glacial-climate-change-in-the-white-mountains-new-hampshire-usadiv/DE8663330CE11C8484FAA0C6DD29DDD1|journal=Quaternary Research|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=96–120|doi=10.1017/qua.2016.4|issn=0033-5894|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result suggests that the Littleton-Bethlehem (L-B) readvance of ice sheet occurred between 14,000 to 13,800 years BP.

==Flora==
Older Dryas species are usually found in sediment below the bottom layer of the bog. Indicator species are the Alpine plants:
:*''[[Betula pubescens]]'' or downy birch (Central Europe);
:*''[[Pinaceae]]'' or pine family (Poland);
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', or dryas;
:*''[[Salix herbacea]]'', or dwarf willow;
:*''[[Oxyria digyna]]'', or mountain sorrel.

Grasslands species are the following: 
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'', sagebrush or wormwood;
:*''[[Ephedra]]'', or joint-fir.
:*''[[Hippophae]]''

==Fauna==
A well-stocked biozone prevailed on the Arctic plains and thickets of the Late Pleistocene. Plains mammals were most predominant:

[[Even-toed ungulate|Artiodactyls]]:
:*''[[Bison priscus]]'', the steppe wisent or steppe bison 
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', the reindeer or caribou
:*''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros giganteus]]'', the Irish elk
:*''[[Moose|Alces alces]]'', the elk
:*''[[Red deer|Cervus elaphus]]'', the red deer
:*''[[Musk ox|Ovibos moschatus]]'', the musk ox
:*''[[Saiga|Saiga tatarica]]'', the saiga
[[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyls]]:
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', the wild horse. Many authors refer to it as ''Equus caballus'', but the latter term is most correctly reserved for the domestic horse. Ferus is presumed to be one or more ancestral or related stocks to caballus and has been described as "caballine".
:*''[[Wooly rhinoceros|Coelodonta antiquitatis]]'', woolly rhinoceros
[[Proboscidea]]:
:*''[[Mammoth|Mammuthus primigenius]]'', the woolly mammoth

So much meat on the hoof must have supported large numbers of [[Carnivora]]:
[[Ursidae]]:
:*''[[Brown bear|Ursus arctos]]'', the brown bear
:*''[[Cave bear|Ursus spelaeus]]'', the cave bear
[[Hyaenidae]]:
:*''[[Hyena|Crocuta crocuta]]'', the spotted hyena
[[Felidae]]:
:*''[[Panthera leo spelaea|Panthera spelaea]]'', the cave lion
[[Canidae]]:
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', the wolf
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', the Arctic fox
[[Mustelidae]]:
:*''[[Wolverine|Gulo gulo]]'', the wolverine

The sea also had its share of carnivores; their maritime location made them survive until modern times:
[[Phocidae]]:
:*''[[Harp seal|Pagophilus groenlandica]]'', the harp seal
:*''[[Ringed seal|Pusa hispida]]'', the ringed seal
[[Odobenidae]]:
:*''[[Walrus|Odobenus rosmarus]]'', the walrus
Of the [[Cetacea]]n [[Odontoceti]], the [[Monodontidae]]:
:*''[[Beluga (whale)|Delphinapterus leucas]]'', the beluga
[[Delphinidae]]:
:*''[[Orca|Orcinus orca]]'', the killer whale
Of the [[Mysticeti]]an [[Eschrichtiidae]]:
:*''[[Gray whale|Eschrictius robustus]]'', the gray whale

The top of the food chain was supported by larger numbers of smaller animals farther down, which lived in the herbaceous blanket covering the tundra or steppe and helped maintain it by carrying seeds, manuring and aerating it.

[[Leporidae]]:
:*''[[Hare|Lepus tanaiticus]]'', the hare
[[Ochotonidae]]:
:*''[[Pika|Ochotona spelaeus]]'', the pika
[[Cricetidae]]:
:*''[[Lemming|Lemmus obensis]]'', Siberian lemming
:*''[[Lemming|Dicrostonix]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Steppe lemming|Lagurus lagurus]]'', steppe lemming
:*''[[Microtus|Microtus gregalis]]'', narrow-headed vole
:*''[[European water vole|Arvicola terrestris]]'', water vole
[[Sciuridae]]:
:*''[[Spermophilus]]'', ground squirrel
[[Dipodidae]]:
:*''[[Allactaga|Allactaga jaculus]]'', the jerboa

==Humans==
Eurasia was populated by ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' ([[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon man]]) during the late [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Bands of humans survived by hunting the mammals of the plains. In [[Northern Europe]] they preferred reindeer, in [[Ukraine]] the [[woolly mammoth]]. They sheltered in huts and manufactured tools around campfires. Ukrainian shelters were supported by mammoth tusks. Humans were already established across [[Siberia]] and in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palaeolithic.dk/books/JAS_39/excerpt.pdf Eriksen, Berit Valentin; Reconsidering the geochronological framework of Lateglacial hunter-gatherer colonization of southern Scandinavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two domestic dogs (''[[Canis familiaris]]'') have been found in late Pleistocene Ukraine and were a heavy breed, similar to a [[Great Dane]], perhaps useful to run down [[Elephantidae]]. The large number of mammoth bones at campsites make it clear that even then, the Elephantidae in Europe were approaching the limit of their duration. Their bones were used for many purposes, one being the numerous objects of art, including an engraved star map.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Late Upper Palaeolithic culture was by no means uniform. Many local traditions have been defined. The [[Hamburgian culture]] had occupied the lowlands and Northern Germany before the Older Dryas. During the Older Dryas, contemporaneous with the Havelte Group of the late Hamburgian, the [[Federmesser culture]] appeared and occupied Denmark and southern Sweden, following the reindeer. South of the Hamburgian was the longstanding [[Magdalenian]]. In Ukraine was the Moldovan, which used tusks to build shelters.

The '''Paley Center for Media''', formerly the '''Museum of Television &amp; Radio''' ('''MT&amp;R''') and the '''Museum of Broadcasting''', founded in 1975 by [[William S. Paley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paleycenter.org/about-mission-history-history/ "History"] Paley Center for Media website&lt;/ref&gt; is an American cultural institution in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] dedicated to the discussion of the cultural, creative, and social significance of television, radio, and emerging platforms for the professional community and media-interested public.

It was renamed The Paley Center for Media on June 5, 2007, to encompass emerging broadcasting technologies such as the [[Internet]], [[mobile video]], and [[podcasting]], as well as to expand its role as a neutral setting where media professionals can engage in discussion and debate about the evolving media landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm "The Museum of Television &amp; Radio announces new name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200514/http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
With an ever-growing collection of content [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[radio]] and [[television]], the Paley Center has two branches; in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The New York City branch is in the heart of [[Midtown Manhattan]] at 25 West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] between [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|5th]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenues]]. The Los Angeles branch is located at 465 N [[Beverly Drive]] in [[Beverly Hills]], near [[Rodeo Drive]].

===New York===
The original Museum of Broadcasting, founded in 1975 by William S. Paley, opened in Manhattan on November 9, 1976, occupying two floors in an office building at 1 East 53rd Street, near the corner of 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. This was adjacent to the Doubleday Book Store on Fifth Avenue.

The Museum of Broadcasting's name was changed to The Museum of Television &amp; Radio with the September 12, 1991 move into the William S. Paley Building. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and located at 25 West 52nd Street (adjacent to the famed [[21 Club]] at 21 West 52nd Street), the 16-story building was itself renamed The Paley Center for Media in 2007. It has two front entrances: the one on the left is for office staff, and the main entrance on the right for the general public. The [[Alexander Mackendrick]] film ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957) has an exterior location scene with different angles revealing how the neighborhood looked in the years before the building was constructed.

The ground-level floor of the New York museum features the ticket and information area and the [[Steven Spielberg]] Gallery, used for exhibitions, receptions and fund-raising events. Reservations to use the Library are made at the front desk. In addition to the elevator, a staircase on the first floor leads down to the large basement-level theater. The fourth floor has numerous computers, used by visitors to locate programming in the collection. When a selection is made, it can be watched on the computer.  Computers are available both for individuals and for groups.

===Los Angeles===
The Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Los Angeles at 465 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, opened March 18, 1996 in a new building designed by [[Richard Meier]] and named for [[Leonard H. Goldenson]]. When the Los Angeles building opened, it featured a collection duplicated from the tapes in the New York collection. Rooms are named for the celebrity sponsors: the [[Danny Thomas]] Lobby, the [[Aaron Spelling]] Reception Area and the [[Garry Marshall]] Pool. Screenings are held in the 150-seat [[John H. Mitchell]] Theatre. The Ahmanson Radio Listening Room has headphones for use with five pre-programmed channels.

==Archives==
The Paley Center for Media is committed to the idea that many television and radio programs are significant works and should be preserved for posterity's sake. Instead of collecting [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[memorabilia]], the Paley Center comprises mostly screening rooms, including two full-sized theaters. Nearly 160,000 television shows, commercials, and radio programs are available in the Paley Center's library, and during each visit, viewers can select and watch shows at individual consoles, and radio programs are accessed through these same consoles.

Some television programs are from the 1940s with radio programs dating back to the 1920s. The earliest TV program in the Museum's collection is a silent film of NBC's 1939 production of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s melodrama ''The Streets of New York'' (1857), with [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], [[George Coulouris]], and [[Jennifer Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Michael. (1994) ''Please Stand By''. Overlook Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum does not sell the material or permit it to leave the premises. Viewing copies of television programs are [[8 mm video format|Hi-8mm video tape]] dubs. The originals are kept in a vault outside of New York City, and the collection is being digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, Elizabeth. (June 5, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/arts/design/05pale.html?ex=1338696000&amp;en=40d8832d1846f00c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss/ "New Name and Mission for Museum of Television"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Paley Center has acquired many lost episodes of classic television shows and has produced [[Documentary film|documentary]] features about the history and impact of television and radio. In recent years, the Center has sponsored advance viewing of the [[pilot episodes]] of each network's new programs.

Television and radio shows are added to the collection after archival discoveries and through donations from individuals and organizations. In 2002, the Museum held a showing of the previously unseen rehearsal film of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' telecast from March 17, 1957.  This rehearsal was found in the [[CBS]] vault while the Museum was on a quest for other "lost" ''Cinderella'' materials. It had been believed that on the night of the live broadcast the show was preserved on both [[kinescope]] and [[videotape]] and then transmitted to the West Coast. Seeking either of these, Jane Klain, the Director of Research at the New York facility, asked CBS to search their vaults. The CBS database listed three 16mm films featuring five-minute segments of [[Julie Andrews]] performing in the show. When the earliest one was brought from the CBS vault, it was discovered to be the full dress rehearsal.

The Center is also known for its many discoveries involving daytime [[game show]]s. Episodes of [[wiping|destroyed]] shows such as ''[[High Rollers]]'', ''[[Celebrity Sweepstakes]]'', ''[[The Money Maze]]'', the [[Chuck Woolery]] version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US daytime game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[To Say the Least]]'', and daytime ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' episodes are all available for viewing in the library. Episodes of other game shows such as ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', and ''[[The Gong Show]]'' are also in the library.

==Programming and education==
Seminars and interviews with public figures are conducted frequently, all of which are recorded and available for later viewing on individual consoles. Past seminar participants have included [[Lucille Ball]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Al Franken]], [[John Frankenheimer]], [[James Garner]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Roy Huggins]], [[Jack Paar]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], and [[Gore Vidal]]. Also available for viewing are seminars featuring creators and cast members from TV shows, including ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[The League]]''. Panel discussions have varied from what it was like to work with [[Orson Welles]] to a celebration of [[Roy Huggins]]'s career.

PaleyFest, also known as the William S. Paley Television Festival, is an annual television festival hosted by the Paley Center in the Los Angeles area. Founded in 1984, the festival, held annually in the spring, features panels composed of the casts and prominent creative talent from popular television shows such as ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[Parks and Recreation (TV series)|Parks and Recreation]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'', and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', among many others. The panels field questions from a moderator and a public audience and often present exclusive content from their respective series. The festival has been in many venues over its history, including the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] Bing Theater, the [[Directors Guild of America]] theater, the [[Cinerama Dome]], and the [[Saban Theatre]] in Beverly Hills. It was relocated to the larger [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=PaleyFest Moves to Dolby Theatre for 2014, Unveils First Honorees|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/paleyfest-2014-pretty-little-liars-666232|website=Hollywood Reporter|date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Advanced Management Program===
In 2010, The Paley Center for Media announced a partnership with [[IESE Business School]] to offer the Advanced Management Program in Media and Entertainment or the "Media AMP", a postgraduate level program for media and entertainment executives to preparing them for high level leadership roles in their companies.  Launched in January 2011, the program’s goal is to bring executives up to speed on new business models, management techniques, and technologies. A key feature is access to leaders in the industry.

The Media AMP curriculum covers four modules over a six-month period. Three of the modules are held in New York, and one in Los Angeles. Key discussion topics include:  Value Creation; Digital Strategy; Accounting, Finance and Management Control; Content and Customers; Leadership; Production, Technology and Operations Management; Entrepreneurship and Innovation; IT Systems and Strategy; Managerial Economics and Decision Analysis; Marketing Strategy; and others.

'''Plastiglomerate''' is a term that was proposed by Patricia Corcoran, [[Charles J.

==Origin==
Plastiglomerates form along [[shoreline]]s where natural sedimentary grains and organic debris are agglutinated by melted plastic created during [[campfire]] burning. They have been reported from Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="The Geological Society of America" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">{{for|other uses of ''prolepsis''|Prolepsis (disambiguation)}}
'''Procatalepsis''', also called '''prolepsis''' or '''prebuttal''', is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialog Theory for Critical Argumentation|author=Douglas N. Walton|pages=106|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978-90-272-1885-8|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]] anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

In argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as "I'm a dead man" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In [[Narratology|narratological analyses]] prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to "flash-forwards" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict" /&gt;

Example:
* "It is difficult to see how a pilot boat could be completely immune to capsizing or plunging, but pilot boat design criteria must meet the needs of the industry and pilotage authorities."

As a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis, Dirk. "Prolepsis in Greek as a Discourse Strategy." ''Glotta'' 62.1/2 (1984): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. 

==Other examples in rhetoric and argument== 

Procatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A [[hypophora]] is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.

The [[Straw Man]] argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a "straw man" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Walton, "The Straw Man Fallacy." ''In Logic and Argumentation'', ed. Johan van Bentham, Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst and Frank Veltman. Amsterdam, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, North-Holland, 1996. pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This "inoculation" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. "Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.

==Inoculation==
Procatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term [[Inoculation theory|inoculation]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory'' describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt; This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.

Inoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory''. An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: "The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy." When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt;

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

==Trivia==
As a teenager, Attardo attended a High School specializing in Humanities (Liceo Ginnasio Statale Alessando Volta, Como) where along with fellow students he published a satyrical magazine on the school life, its teachers and principal, called "Giravolta." In these early days, he was known by the nickname of "Pidou."

{{use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}
The '''Smurfette principle''' is the practice in media, such as film, television series and television networks, to include only one woman in an otherwise entirely male ensemble.&lt;ref name="DayKugler2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lori Day|author2=Charlotte Kugler|title=Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip, and So Much More|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6k2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-61374-859-6|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/07/the-problem-with-smurfette/242690/|title=The Problem With Smurfette|last=Richards|first=Jason|date=2011-07-28|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Katha Pollitt]] in 1991 in ''[[The New York Times]]'':&lt;ref name="hers"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/magazine/hers-the-smurfette-principle.html Hers; The Smurfette Principle]. ''The New York Times'', 7 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

She may or may not play a major role in the story, but typically is “everything female.” Some examples that Pollitt cites include the mother figure, a “glamour queen,” or a female sidekick of sorts.&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt; As a consequence, works employing this [[Trope (literature)|trope]] often fail the [[Bechdel test]], an indicator of gender bias in fiction.{{quote|Contemporary shows are either essentially all-male, like "[[Garfield]]", or are organized on what I call the Smurfette principle: a group of male buddies will be accented by a lone female, stereotypically defined... The message is clear. Boys are the norm, girls the variation; boys are central, girls peripheral; boys are individuals, girls types. Boys define the group, its story and its code of values. Girls exist only in relation to boys.}}This term continues to be used in discourse to describe not only "preschool culture," but also popular media from the last 40 years.

== Origin ==
Pollitt observed this as what she thought of in terms of a common media practice while shopping for her daughter’s Christmas toys. The initial use of the term was in relation to “preschool culture,” that to Pollitt, would hinder a child’s understanding of gender. She goes further to say, “The sexism in preschool culture deforms both boys and girls. Little girls learn to split their consciousness, filtering their dreams and ambitions through boy characters while admiring the clothes of the princess.”&lt;ref name="hers" /&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In 2011 Pollitt discussed her term again in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She said that the issue is still highly prevalent in the current media. She specifically cited the then major blockbuster, ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', which had only one female main character (played by [[Elle Fanning]]). Also at this time, she extended the principle to include television networks. The only major anchor in the MSNBC lineup in 2011, according to Pollitt was [[Rachel Maddow]]. She said, "there's one Rachel Maddow, and then there's that whole male lineup. There's Ed [Schultz], there used to be Keith [Olbermann], and Lawrence O'Donnell, and now there's going to be Al Sharpton. It's quite remarkable that there's only this one woman, and it's never equal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This term has not disappeared by any means, making many appearances in popular literature and discourse. Journalists complain that major blockbusters that will turn out millions of dollars, include only one female, and this trend is not fading anytime soon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/movies/the-smurfette-principle-why-can%E2%80%99t-hollywood-accept-gender-equality/ar-BBGz820?li=AA5a2k|title=The Smurfette Principle: why can’t Hollywood accept gender equality?|website=www.msn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible in ensemble movie posters, like with [[Ocean's Eleven|''Ocean's Eleven'']], [[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']] and [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4616798/movie-posters-single-woman/|title=This Is the Disturbing Movie Poster 'Smurfette Principle'|last=TIME|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Rose looks at Eleven’s situation in the TV show ''[[Stranger Things]]'', where she is essentially replaced (while on her own adventures) by Max, another young girl, who is also teased, then “lusted after,” another common reaction to a lone female character.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The “Smurfette,” or sole female cast member, has been understood to typically have a stereotypical role of a romantic partner, a “brooding badass,” or exists to deflate the tension of an all-male cast.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a result of the discontent about the lack of women, a new pattern has emerged, of “gender-inversion,” casts of exclusively female actresses, like ''[[Ocean's 8|Ocean’s 8]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]''.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tn2magazine.ie/smurfette-principle/|title=The Smurfette Principle|date=2017-08-25|work=TN2 Magazine|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] found that only “10% of all films have a gender balanced cast,” thus reinforcing the existence of the lack of fair female representation, i.e. the Smurfette Principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|title=Gender Bias Without Borders - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In an article and video for ''Bitch Magazine'', [[Anita Sarkeesian]] asserts that the reoccurrence of this issue is that media from the 1980s and 1990s is continuously being remade, which still typically adhere to this principle, creating an ongoing cycle. She also called on the film industry to include more female characters, or even a female dominated cast, ''and'' pass the [[Bechdel test]]. After these are kept in mind and actually accomplished, meaningful diversity will be possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/tropes-vs-women-3-the-smurfette-principle/|title=Tropes vs. Women: #3 The Smurfette Principle|date=2011-04-21|work=Feminist Frequency|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in scholarship ==
Rickie Solinger, in a review of some of Pollitt’s major works up to 1993, stated that the “Smurfette Principle” is applicable to preschoolers and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|date=1995|editor-last=Pollitt|editor-first=Katha|title=First-Class Citizen|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4022132|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.2307/4022132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Susina, a scholar and researcher of child and adolescent literature, used the term in a 1995 edition of the journal, ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', to back up his assertion that children’s literature is being “dumbed down” as a larger symptom of cultural problems, particularly that entertainment is like “junk food,” or unrewarding to the audience. He uses Pollitt’s term as evidence that a lack of women contributes to low quality media for children and also that the popular media has picked up on this issue in major publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susina|first=Jan|date=1993|title=Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/244499|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=v–ix|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256|issn=1080-6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Examples==
Named after [[Smurfette]], the only female among [[the Smurfs]] (a group of comic book creatures), the principle has been observed in the following works among others:

==Early life==
Hockey was born Susan Petty in 1946 in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], and educated at [[Princess Mary High School]], Halifax and [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]].  
== Career ==
In 1969 she joined the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] in Oxfordshire. She became a founding member of the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]] (ALLC) in 1973 and in 1975 she joined [[Oxford University Computing Services]]. At Atlas she developed software for the display of non-Western characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/associates/permanent/hockey.htm|title=Susan Hockey|website=Chilton Computing|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Oxford she was instrumental in developing the Oxford Concordance Program from [[COCOA (digital humanities)|COCOA]], an early piece of software used in humanities computing.  These tools have become central to the practice of the digital humanities in the United States and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vanhoutte|first1=edited by Melissa Terras, Julianne Nyhan, Edward|title=Defining digital humanities : a reader|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham|isbn=1409469638|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siemens|first1=Ray|last2=Schreibman|first2=Susan|title=A Companion to Digital Literary Studies|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=1118508831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1997 Hockey was director of the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton Universities]] in [[New Jersey]].  From 1997 to 1999 she was Professor and Director of the Canadian Institute for Research Computing in Arts at the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton]].  In 2000 she joined [[University College London]] as Professor of Library and Information Studies, and from 2001 was Director of the [[School of Library, Archive and Information Studies]] at UCL.  She retired in 2004.&lt;ref name=eadh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eadh.org/susan-hockey-curriculum-vitae-publications|publisher=European Association for Digital Humanities|title=Susan Hockey - Curriculum Vitae &amp; Publications|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Hockey was awarded the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]]'s Roberto Busa Prize in recognition of "outstanding lifetime achievements in the application of information and communications technologies to humanities research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adho.org/awards/roberto-busa-prize|title=Roberto Busa Prize|website=Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations (ADHO)|publisher=Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations (ADHO)|accessdate=2 July 2015|ref=adhobusaprize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">'''Theoretical linguistics''', or '''general linguistics''', is the branch of [[linguistics]] which inquires into the nature of [[language]] itself and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is; how it works; how [[universal grammar]] (UG) as a domain-specific mental organ operates, if it exists at all; what are its unique properties; how does language relate to other cognitive processes, etc. Theoretical linguists are most concerned with constructing models of linguistic knowledge, and ultimately developing a linguistic theory.

The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], syntax, and semantics. Although [[phonetics]] often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with [[semantics]]. Theoretical linguistics also involves the search for an explanation of linguistic universals, that is, properties that all, or many [[language]]s have in common.

==Terminology==

In the first half of the 20th century, the term "general linguistics" was more common (cf. Ferdinand de Saussure's famous ''Course in General Linguistics''), which could be contrasted with "language-particular linguistics" (which is more often called [[descriptive linguistics]]). Since the 1960s, the term "theoretical linguistics" has typically been used in more or less the same sense as "general linguistics", even though it also contrasts with [[applied linguistics]], and even though it is often said that language description is inherently theoretical. The usual terminology is thus not entirely clear and consistent.

==Major fields==
{{See|grammar|formal grammar|grammar framework}}

===Phonetics===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Phonetics is the study of speech sounds with concentration on three main points :
* Manner of articulation|Articulation: the production of speech sounds in human speech organs.
* [[Perception]] : the way human ears respond to speech signals, how the human brain analyses them.
* Acoustic features : physical characteristics of speech sounds such as, loudness, amplitude, frequency etc.
According to this definition, phonetics can also be called linguistic analysis of human speech at the surface level. That is one obvious difference from [[phonology]], which concerns the structure and organisation of speech sounds in natural languages, and furthermore has a theoretical and abstract nature. One example can be made to illustrate this distinction:
In English, the suffix ''-s'' can represent either {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or can be silent (written Ø) depending on context.
 
====Articulatory phonetics====

The field of [[articulatory phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics. In studying [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], phoneticians attempt to document how humans produce speech sounds (vowels and consonants). That is, articulatory phoneticians are interested in how the different structures of the vocal tract, called the articulators (tongue, lips, jaw, palate, teeth etc.), interact to create the specific sounds.

====Auditory phonetics====

[[Auditory phonetics]] is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing, acquisition and comprehension of phonetic sounds of words of a language.  As articulatory phonetics explores the methods of sound production, auditory phonetics explores the methods of reception—the ear to the brain, and those processes.

====Acoustic phonetics====

[[Acoustic phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics which deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates properties like the mean squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its [[fundamental frequency]], or other properties of its frequency spectrum, and the relationship of these properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics), and to abstract linguistic concepts like phones, phrases, or utterances.

=== Phonology ===
{{See|Phonology}}

[[Phonology]] (sometimes called ''phonemics'' or ''phonematics'') is the study of how sounds are used in languages to convey meaning. Phonology includes topics such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The basic unit of analysis for phonology is called [[phoneme]]. A phoneme is a group of sounds which are not distinguished by the language rules in determining the meaning. In English, for example, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʰ]}} are different [[allophone]]s that represent a single phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the internal structure of words. For example, in the sentences ''The dog runs'' and ''The dogs run'', the [[word form]]s ''runs'' and ''dogs'' have an affix ''-s'' added, distinguishing them from the base forms ''dog'' and ''run''. Adding this suffix to a [[noun|nominal]] stem gives plural forms, adding it to [[verb]]al stems restricts the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] to third person singular. Some morphological theories operate with two distinct suffixes ''-s'', called [[allomorph]]s of the [[morpheme]]s Plural and Third person singular, respectively. Languages differ with respect to their morphological structure. Along one axis, we may distinguish [[analytic language]]s, with few or no affixes or other morphological processes from [[synthetic language]]s with many affixes. Along another axis, we may distinguish [[agglutinative language]]s, where affixes express one grammatical property each, and are added neatly one after another, from [[fusional language]]s, with non-concatenative morphological processes ([[infixation]], [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], [[ablaut]], etc.) and/or with less clear-cut affix boundaries.

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of language structure and phrasal hierarchies, depicted in [[parse tree]] format. It is concerned with the relationship between units at the level of words or morphology. Syntax seeks to exactly delineate all and only those sentences which make up a given language, using  native speaker intuition. Syntax seeks to formally describe exactly how structural relations between elements (lexical items/words and operators) in a sentence contribute to its interpretation. Syntax uses principles of formal logic and Set Theory to formalize and accurately represent the hierarchical relationship between elements in a sentence. [[Abstract syntax tree]]s are often used to illustrate the hierarchical structures that are posited. Thus, in active declarative sentences in English the subject is followed by the main verb which in turn is followed by the object (SVO). This order of elements is crucial to its correct interpretation and it is exactly this which syntacticians try to capture. They argue that there must be a formal computational component contained within the language faculty of normal speakers of a language and seek to describe it.

===Semantics===
[[Semantics]] is the study of [[intension]], that is, the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases. Much of the work in the field of [[philosophy of language]] is concerned with the relation between meanings and the word, and this concern cross-cuts formal semantics in several ways. For example, both philosophers of language and semanticists make use of propositional, predicate and modal logics to express their ideas about word meaning.

{{lead too short|date=January 2017}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] '''theories about religion''' (or '''theories of religion''') generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

==History==
From [[presocratic]] times, ancient authors advanced [[:wikt:prescientific | prescientific]] theories about religion.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"&gt;Segal 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Herodotus]] (484 – 425 [[Common Era|BCE]]) saw the gods of Greece as the same as the gods of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euhemerus]] (about 330 – 264 BCE) regarded gods as excellent historical persons whom admirers eventually [[Euhemerism|came to worship]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"/&gt;

Scientific theories, inferred and tested by the [[comparative sociology | comparative method]], emerged after data from tribes and peoples all over the world became available in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"/&gt; [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) has the reputation of having founded the scientific study of religion; he advocated a comparative method that developed into  [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926-2006) and others questioned the validity of abstracting a general theory of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Theories of religion can be classified into:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Substantive (or [[essentialist]]) theories that focus on the contents of religions and the meaning the contents have for people. This approach asserts that people have faith because beliefs make sense insofar as they hold value and are comprehensible. The theories by Tylor and Frazer (focusing on the explanatory value of religion for its adherents), by Rudolf Otto (focusing on the importance of [[religious experience]], more specifically experiences that are both fascinating and terrifying) and by Mircea Eliade (focusing on the longing for otherworldly perfection, the quest for meaning, and the search for patterns in mythology in various religions) offer examples of substantive theories.
* [[Structural functionalism|Functional]] (and in a stronger form [[Reductionism|reductionist]]) theories that focus on the social or psychological functions that religion has for a group or a person. In simple terms, the functional approach sees religion as "performing certain functions for society"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories by Karl Marx (role of religion in capitalist and pre-capitalist societies), Sigmund Freud ([[psychology|psychological]] origin of religious beliefs), Émile Durkheim (social function of religions), and the theory by Stark and Bainbridge exemplify functional theories.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1998|loc=Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach tends to be static, with the exception of Marx' theory, and unlike e.g. Weber's approach, which treats of the interaction and dynamic processes between religions and the rest of societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other dichotomies according to which theories or descriptions of religions can be classified include:&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "insider" versus "outsider" perspectives (roughly corresponding to [[emic and etic|emic versus etic]] descriptions)
* individualist versus social views
* [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] versus [[relativism|relativist]] views

==Methodologies==
Early '''essentialists''', such as Tylor and Frazer, looked for similar beliefs and practices in all societies, especially the more primitive ones, more or less regardless of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Emile Durkheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; They relied heavily on reports made by missionaries, discoverers, and colonial civil servants. These were all investigators who had a religious background themselves, thus they looked at religion from the inside. Typically they did not practice investigative field work, but used the accidental reports of others. This method left them open to criticism for lack of universality, which many freely admitted. The theories could be updated, however, by considering new reports, which [[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1866-1943) did for Tylor's theory of the evolution of religion.

Field workers deliberately sent out by universities and other institutions to collect specific cultural data made available a much greater database than random reports. For example, the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902-1973) preferred detailed [[Ethnography|ethnographical]] study of tribal religion as more reliable. He criticised the work of his predecessors, [[Max Müller|Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Tylor]], and [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], as untestable speculation. He called them "armchair anthropologists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second methodology, '''functionalism''', seeks explanations of religion that are outside of religion; i.e., the theorists are generally (but not necessarily) atheists or agnostics themselves. As did the essentialists, the functionalists proceeded from reports to investigative studies. Their fundamental assumptions, however, are quite different; notably, they apply what is called{{by whom|date=April 2015}} "methodological naturalism". When explaining religion they reject divine or [[supernatural]] explanations for the status or origins of religions because they are not scientifically testable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, theorists such as Marett (an Anglican) excluded scientific results altogether, defining religion as the domain of the unpredictable and unexplainable; that is, comparative religion is the rational (and scientific) study of the irrational. The dichotomy between the two classifications is not bridgeable, even though they have the same methods, because each excludes the data of the other.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The functionalists and some of the later essentialists (among others E. E. Evans-Pritchard) have criticized the '''substantive''' view as neglecting social aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|pp=47, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such critics go so far as to brand Tylor's and Frazer's views on the origin of religion as unverifiable speculation.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 47"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of [[monotheism]] as more evolved than [[polytheism]] represents a mere preconception, they assert. There is evidence that monotheism is more prevalent in hunter societies than in agricultural societies.{{cn|date=November 2015}} The view of a uniform progression in folkways is criticized as unverifiable, as the writer [[Andrew Lang]] (1844–1912) and E. E. Evans-Pritchard assert.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2005&gt;{{harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter criticism presumes that the evolutionary views of the early cultural anthropologists envisaged a uniform cultural evolution. Another criticism supposes that Tylor and Frazer were individualists (unscientific). However, some support that supposed approach as worthwhile, among others the anthropologist [[Robin W.G. Horton|Robin Horton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between the two fundamental presumptions - and the question of what data can be considered valid - continues.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Substantive theories==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|right|360px|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of [[the Golden Bough]] incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]

===Evolutionary theories===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Evolutionary theories view religion as either an adaptation or a byproduct. Adaptationist theories view religion as being of adaptive value to the survival of Pleistocene humans. Byproduct theories view religion as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]].

===Edward Burnett Tylor===
[[File:PSM V26 D156 Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|250px|Edward Burnett Tylor]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832–1917) defined religion as belief in spiritual beings and stated that this belief originated as explanations of natural phenomena. Belief in spirits grew out of attempts to explain life and death. Primitive people used human dreams in which spirits seemed to appear as an indication that the human mind could exist independent of a body. They used this by extension to explain life and death, and belief in the after life. [[Myth]]s and [[deity|deities]] to explain natural phenomena originated by analogy and an extension of these explanations. His theory assumed that the psyches of all peoples of all times are more or less the same and that explanations in [[Unilineal evolution#Tylor .26 Morgan|cultures and religions tend to grow more sophisticated]] via [[monotheism|monotheist]] religions, such as [[Christianity]] and eventually to [[science]]. Tylor saw practices and beliefs in modern societies that were similar to those of primitive societies as ''survivals'', but he did not explain why they survived.

===James George Frazer===
[[James George Frazer]] (1854–1941) followed Tylor's theories to a great extent in his book [[The Golden Bough]], but he distinguished between [[magical thinking|magic]] and [[religion]]. [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] is used to influence the natural world in the primitive man's struggle for survival. He asserted that [[Sympathetic magic|magic relied on an uncritical belief of primitive people in contact and imitation]]. For example, precipitation may be invoked by the primitive man by sprinkling water on the ground. He asserted that according to them magic worked through laws. In contrast religion is faith that the natural world is ruled by one or more deities with personal characteristics with whom can be pleaded, not by laws.

===Rudolf Otto===

The theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) focused on [[religious experience]], more specifically moments that he called [[numinous]] which means "Wholly Other". He described it as ''mysterium tremendum'' (terrifying mystery) and ''mysterium fascinans'' (awe inspiring, fascinating mystery). He saw religion as emerging from these experiences.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

He asserted that these experiences arise from a special, non-rational faculty of the human mind, largely unrelated to other faculties, so religion cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to culture or society. Some of his views, among others that the experience of the [[numinous]] was caused by a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] reality, are untestable and hence unscientific.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"/&gt;

His ideas strongly influenced [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenologists]] and [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|Psychology of religion#Rudolf Otto|Religious experience#The numinous}}

===Mircea Eliade===
[[File:Mircea Eliade2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mircea Eliade]]
{{main|Eternal return (Eliade)|Hierophany|}}
[[Mircea Eliade]]'s (1907–1986) approach grew out of the [[phenomenology of religion]]. Like Otto, he saw religion as something special and autonomous, that cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to the social, economical or psychological alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Durkheim, he saw the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] as central to religion, but differing from Durkheim, he views the sacred as often dealing with the [[supernatural]], not with the clan or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily life of an ordinary person is connected to the sacred by the appearance of the sacred, called [[hierophany]]. [[Theophany]] (an appearance of a god) is a special case of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Eternal return (Eliade)|The Myth of the Eternal Return]]'' Eliade wrote that archaic men wish to participate in the sacred, and that they long to return to lost paradise outside the historic time to escape meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primitive man could not endure that his struggle to survive had no meaning.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, man had a [[nostalgia]] (longing) for an otherworldly perfection. Archaic man wishes to escape the ''terror of time'' and saw [[cyclic time|time as cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"/&gt; Historical religions like Christianity and Judaism revolted against this older concept of cyclic time. They provided meaning and contact with the sacred ''in'' history through the god of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sought and found patterns in [[mythology|myth]] in various cultures, e.g. [[sky god]]s such as [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's methodology was studying [[comparative religion]] of various cultures and societies more or less regardless of other aspects of these societies, often relying on second hand reports. He also used some personal knowledge of other societies and cultures for his theories, among others his knowledge of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[folk religion]].

He has been criticized for vagueness in defining his key concepts. Like Frazer and Tylor he has also been accused of out-of-context comparisons of religious beliefs of very different societies and cultures.
He has also been accused of having a pro-religious bias (Christian and Hindu), though this bias does not seem essential for his theory.

===E. E. Evans-Pritchard&lt;!--linked from 'E. E. Evans-Pritchard'--&gt;===
[[File:Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard.jpg|thumb|250px|Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard in the Social and Cultural Anthropology Library, Oxford]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) did extensive [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies among the [[Azande]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] peoples who were considered "primitive" by society and earlier scholars. Evans-Pritchard saw these people as different, but not primitive.

Unlike the previous scholars, Evans-Pritchard did not propose a grand universal theory and he did extensive long-term fieldwork among "primitive" peoples, studying their culture and religion, among other among the [[Azande]]. Not just passing contact, like Eliade.

He argued that the religion of the Azande ([[witchcraft]] and [[oracle]]s) can not be understood without the social context and its social function. Witchcraft and oracles played a great role in solving disputes among the Azande. In this respect he agreed with Durkheim, though he acknowledged that Frazer and Tylor were right that their religion also had an intellectual explanatory aspect. The Azande's faith in witchcraft and oracles was quite logical and consistent once some fundamental tenets were accepted. Loss of faith in the fundamental tenets could not be endured because of its social importance and hence they had an elaborate system of explanations (or excuses) against disproving evidence. Besides an alternative system of terms or school of thought did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was heavily critical about earlier theorists of [[primitive religion]] with the exception of [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], asserting that they made statements about primitive people without having enough inside knowledge to make more than a guess. In spite of his praise of Bruhl's works, Evans-Pritchard disagreed with Bruhl's statement that a member of a "primitive" tribe saying "I am the moon" is prelogical, but that this statement makes perfect sense within their culture if understood metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Azande, Evans-Pritchard, also studied the neighbouring, but very different [[Nuer people|Nuer]] people. The Nuer had had an abstract monotheistic faith, somewhat similar to [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], though it included lesser spirits. They had also [[totemism]], but this was a minor aspect of their religion and hence a corrective to Durkheim's generalizations should be made. Evans-Pritchard did not propose a theory of religion''s'', but only a theory of the Nuer religion.

===Clifford Geertz===
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926–2006) made several studies in [[Java]]nese villages. He avoided the subjective and vague concept of group [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] as used by [[Ruth Benedict]] by using the analysis of society as proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] who in turn had adapted it from [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Parsons' adaptation distinguished all human groups on three levels i.e. ''1.'' an individual level that is controlled by ''2.'' a [[social system]] that is in turn controlled by ''3.'' a [[cultural system]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Geertz followed Weber when he wrote that "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/obituaries/01geertz.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title=Clifford Geertz, Cultural Anthropologist, Is Dead at 80 | accessdate=2008-03-14 | first=Andrew L. | last=Yarrow |date=November 1, 2006 | journal=New York Times: Obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz held the view that mere explanations to describe religions and cultures are not sufficient: interpretations are needed too. He advocated what he called ''[[thick description]]s'' to interpret symbols by observing them in use, and for this work, he was known as a founder of symbolic anthropology. 

Geertz saw religion as one of the [[cultural system]]s of a society. He defined religion as 
:(1) a system of symbols
:(2) which acts to establish powerful, pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in men
:(3) by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
:(4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that
:(5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With symbols Geertz meant a carrier that embodies a conception, because he saw religion and culture as systems of communication.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"/&gt;

This definition emphasizes the mutual reinforcement between [[world view]] and [[ethos]].
&lt;!-- WHAT DOES EACH POINT THIS DEFINITION MEAN? SOURCES: PALSE AND KUNIN --&gt;

Though he used more or less the same methodology as Evans-Pritchard, he did not share Evans-Pritchard's hope that a theory of religion could ever be found. Geertz proposed methodology was not the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]], but [[Historical method|the method of historians studying history]].

==Functional theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Image:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) ]]
{{main|Marxism and religion}}
The social philosopher [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) held a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] worldview.
According to Marx, the dynamics of society were determined by the [[relations of production]], that is, the relations that its members needed to enter into to produce their means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing on the ideas of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], he saw religion as a product of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] that was functional to [[opium of the people|relieving people's immediate suffering]], and as an ideology that masked the real nature of social relations.
He deemed it a contingent part of human culture, that would have disappeared after the abolition of class society.

These claims were limited, however, to his analysis of the historical relationship between European cultures, political institutions, and their Christian religious traditions.
&lt;!--WHAT IS FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO RELIGION? (Pals) --&gt;

Marxist views strongly influenced individuals' comprehension and conclusions about society, among others the anthropological school of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].

Marx' explanations for all religions, always, in all forms, and everywhere have never been taken seriously by many experts in the field, though a substantial fraction accept that Marx' views possibly explain some aspects of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent work has suggested that, while the standard account of Marx's analysis of religion is true, it is also only one side of a dialectical account, which takes seriously the disruptive, as well as the passifying moments of religion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=AM | year=2005 | title=Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion | journal=Critical Sociology | volume= 31 | number=No. 1-2 | pages=15–38 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud===
[[File:Freud 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|Sigmund Freud, 1885]]
{{main|Freud and religion|The Future of an Illusion|Totem and Taboo|Moses and Monotheism|Oedipus complex}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) saw religion as an [[The Future of an Illusion|illusion]], a belief that people very much wanted to be true. Unlike Tylor and Frazer, Freud attempted to explain why religion persists in spite of the lack of evidence for its tenets. Freud asserted that religion is a largely [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neurosis|neurotic]] response to [[Psychological repression|repression]]. By repression Freud meant that civilized society demands that we not fulfill all our desires immediately, but that they have to be repressed. Rational arguments to a person holding a religious conviction will not change the neurotic response of a person. This is in contrast to Tylor and Frazer, who saw religion as a rational and conscious, though primitive and mistaken, attempt to explain the natural world.

In his 1913 book ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' he developed a speculative story about how all [[monotheism|monotheist religions]] originated and developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he asserted that monotheistic religions grew out of a homicide in a clan of a father by his sons. This incident was subconsciously remembered in human societies.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of [[Akhenaten]] who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=S | last=Freud | encyclopedia=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume=Volume XXIII (1937{{ndash}}1939) | title=Moses and monotheism | location=London | publisher=[[Hogarth Press]] | year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's view on religion was embedded in his larger theory of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Psychoanalysis#Scientific criticism|which has been criticized as unscientific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Freud's attempt to explain the historical [[origin of religion|origins of religions]] have not been accepted, his generalized view that all religions originate from unfulfilled psychological needs is still seen as offering a credible explanation in some cases.{{sfn|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion|pp=280–281}}

[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) saw the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|concept of the sacred]] as the defining characteristic of religion, not faith in the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw religion as a reflection of the concern for society. He based his view on recent research regarding [[totemism]] among the [[Australian aboriginals]]. With [[totemism]] he meant that each of the many clans had a different object, plant, or animal that they held sacred and that symbolizes the clan. Durkheim saw [[totemism]] as the original and simplest form of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Durkheim, the analysis of this simple form of religion could provide the building blocks for more complex religions. He asserted that moralism cannot be separated from religion. The sacred i.e. religion reinforces group interest that clash very often with individual interests. Durkheim held the view that the function of religion is group cohesion often performed by collectively attended rituals. He asserted that these group meeting provided a special kind of energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A | year=2014 | title=Elementary Forms of the Metaphorical Life: Tropes at Work in Durkheim’s Theory of the Religious | journal=Journal of Classical Sociology | volume= 14 | number=No. 2 | pages=203–221 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3284/1/elementary_metaphors_of_the_religious_life_author_version_doc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he called [[collective effervescence|effervescence]], that made group members lose their individuality and to feel united with the gods and thus with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differing from Tylor and Frazer, he saw magic not as religious, but as an individual instrument to achieve something.

Durkheim's proposed method for progress and refinement is first to carefully study religion in its simplest form in one contemporary society and then the same in another society and compare the religions then and only between societies that are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTARY FORMS OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION THAT ARE ALSO PRESENT IN MORE COMPLEX RELIGIONS? SOURCE PALS --&gt;
The empirical basis for Durkheim's view has been severely criticized when more detailed studies of the Australian aboriginals surfaced. More specifically, the definition of religion as dealing with the sacred only, regardless of the supernatural, is not supported by studies of these aboriginals. The view that religion has a social aspect, at the very least, introduced in a generalized very strong form by Durkheim has become influential and uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's approach gave rise to [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalist school in sociology and anthropology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism is a sociological paradigm that originally attempted to explain social institutions as collective means to fill individual biological needs, focusing on the ways in which social institutions fill social needs, especially social stability. Thus because Durkheim viewed society as an "organismic analogy of the body, wherein all the parts work together to maintain the equilibrium of the whole, religion was understood to be the glue that held society together.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronisław Malinowski===
The anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was strongly influenced by the functionalist school and argued that religion originated from coping with [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strenski2006p269&gt;{{harvnb|Strenski|2006|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw science as practical knowledge that every society needs abundantly to survive and magic as related to this practical knowledge, but generally dealing with phenomena that humans cannot control.

===Max Weber===
[[Image:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Max Weber]]]]
{{main|Sociology of Religion (book)|Charismatic authority|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism|Three-component theory of stratification}}
[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) thought that the truth claims of religious movement were irrelevant for the scientific study of the movements.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; He portrayed each religion as rational and consistent in their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weber acknowledged that religion had a strong social component, but diverged from Durkheim by arguing, for example in his book  [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] that religion can be a force of change in society. In the book Weber wrote that modern [[capitalism]] spread quickly partially due to the Protestant worldly ascetic morale.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; Weber's main focus was not on developing a theory of religion but on the interaction between society and religion, while introducing concepts that are still widely used in the [[sociology of religion]]. These concept include
* [[Church sect typology]], Weber distinguished between [[sect]]s and churches by stating that membership of a sect is a personal choice and church membership is determined by birth. The typology later developed more extensively by his friend [[Ernst Troeltsch]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bendix49-50"&gt;{{harvnb|Bendix|1977|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the typology, churches, [[Ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesia]], [[Religious denomination|denomination]], and [[sect]]s form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are protest break away groups and tend to be in tension with society.
* [[Ideal type]], a hypothetical "pure" or "clear" form, used in [[Typification|typologies]]
* [[Charismatic authority]] Weber saw charisma as a volatile form or authority that depends on the acceptance of unique quality of a person by this person's followers. Charisma can be a revolutionary force and the authority can either be [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinized]] (change into [[Tripartite classification of authority|other forms of authority]]) or disappear upon the death of the charismatic person.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

Somewhat differing from Marx, Weber dealt with [[status group]]s, not with [[Social class|class]]. In status groups the primary motivation is prestige and [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status groups have differing levels of access to power and prestige and indirectly to economic resources. In [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his 1920 treatment of the religion in China]] he saw [[Confucianism]] as helping a certain status group, i.e. the educated elite to maintain access to prestige and power. He asserted that Confucianism opposition against both extravagance and thrift made it unlikely that capitalism could have originated in China.

He used the concept of ''[[Verstehen#Weber and the social sciences|Verstehen]]'' (German for "understanding") to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational choice theory===
{{main|Theory of religious economy}}
The [[rational choice theory]] has been applied to religions, among others by the sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] (1934 – ) and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1940 – ).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see religions as systems of "compensators",  and view human beings as "rational actors, making choices that she or he thinks best, calculating costs and benefits".&lt;ref&gt;The quote is from {{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{harvnb|Nauta|1998|loc=Stark, Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compensators are a body of language and practices that compensate for some physical lack or frustrated goal. They can be divided into specific compensators (compensators for the failure to achieve specific goals), and general compensators (compensators for failure to achieve any goal).&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; They define religion as a system of compensation that relies on the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasoning behind this theory is that the compensation is what controls the choice, or in other words the choices which the "rational actors" make are "rational in the sense that they are centered on the satisfaction of wants".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that social or political movements that fail to achieve their goals will often transform into religions. As it becomes clear that the goals of the movement will not be achieved by natural means (at least within their lifetimes), members of the movement will look to the supernatural to achieve what cannot be achieved naturally. The new religious beliefs are compensators for the failure to achieve the original goals. Examples of this include the [[counterculture]] movement in America: the early counterculture movement was intent on changing society and removing its injustice and boredom; but as members of the movement proved unable to achieve these goals they turned to Eastern and new religions as compensators.

Most religions start out their lives as [[cult]]s or [[sect]]s, i.e. groups in high tension with the surrounding society, containing different views and beliefs contrary to the societal norm. Over time, they tend to either die out, or become more established, mainstream and in less tension with society. Cults are new groups with a new novel [[theology]], while sects are attempts to return mainstream religions to (what the sect views as) their original purity. Mainstream established groups are called [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s. The comments below about cult formation apply equally well to sect formation.

There are four models of cult formation: the [[psychopathology|Psychopathological]] Model, the Entrepreneurial Model, the Social Model and the Normal [[Revelation]]s model.
*'''Psychopathological model''': religions are founded during a period of severe stress in the life of the founder. The founder suffers from psychological problems, which they resolve through the founding of the religion. (The development of the religion is for them a form of self-therapy, or self-medication.)
*'''Entrepreneurial model''': founders of religions act like entrepreneurs, developing new products (religions) to sell to consumers (to convert people to). According to this model, most founders of new religions already have experience in several religious groups before they begin their own. They take ideas from the pre-existing religions, and try to improve on them to make them more popular.
*'''Social model:''' religions are founded by means of [[social implosion]]s. Members of the religious group spend less and less time with people outside the group, and more and more time with each other within it. The level of affection and emotional bonding between members of a group increases, and their emotional bonds to members outside the group diminish. According to the social model, when a social implosion occurs, the group will naturally develop a new theology and rituals to accompany it.
*'''Normal revelations''': religions are founded when the founder interprets ordinary natural phenomena as supernatural; for instance, ascribing his or her own creativity in inventing the religion to that of the deity.
Some religions are better described by one model than another, though all apply to differing degrees to all religions.

Once a cult or sect has been founded, the next problem for the founder is to convert new members to it. Prime candidates for [[religious conversion]] are those with an openness to religion, but who do not belong or fit well in any existing religious group. Those with no religion or no interest in religion are difficult to convert, especially since the cult and sect beliefs are so extreme by the standards of the surrounding society. But those already happy members of a religious group are difficult to convert as well, since they have strong social links to their preexisting religion and are unlikely to want to sever them in order to join a new one. The best candidates for religious conversion are those who are members of or have been associated with religious groups (thereby showing an interest or openness to religion), yet exist on the fringe of these groups, without strong social ties to prevent them from joining a new group.

Potential converts vary in their level of social connection. [[New religious movement|New religions]] best spread through pre-existing friendship networks. Converts who are marginal with few friends are easy to convert, but having few friends to convert they cannot add much to the further growth of the organization. Converts with a large social network are harder to convert, since they tend to have more invested in mainstream society; but once converted they yield many new followers through their friendship network.

Cults initially can have quite high growth rates; but as the social networks that initially feed them are exhausted, their growth rate falls quickly. On the other hand, the rate of [[exponential growth|growth is exponential]] (ignoring the limited supply of potential converts): the more converts you have, the more missionaries you can have out looking for new converts. But nonetheless it can take a very long time for religions to grow to a large size by natural growth. This often leads to cult leaders giving up after several decades, and withdrawing the cult from the world.

It is difficult for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more than about a generation. As children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.

The [[theory of religious economy]] sees different [[religious organizations]] competing for followers in a religious economy, much like the way [[business]]es compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. Theorists assert that a true religious economy is the result of [[religious pluralism]], giving the population a wider variety of choices in religion. According to the theory, the more [[religion]]s there are, the more likely the population is to be religious and hereby contradicting the [[Secularization|secularization thesis]].

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.

Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32513">Women are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK36356/|title=The Underrepresentation of Women in Engineering and Related Sciences: Pursuing Two Complementary Paths to Parity|last=MentorNet|date=2003|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt; Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Women in engineering in the United States}}
Females are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |title=Data on Women in S&amp;E |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819125228/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/cwsem/index.htm|title=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|publisher=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Brian|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/11-47.pdf|website=ASEE|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,
[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates Women Lead in Doctorates], ''Inside Higher Ed,'' September 14, 2010 (accessed June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; then to 22.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[Biosystems engineering|biosystems]], and [[geological engineering]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

The number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in [[Saskatchewan]],  [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

On average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; The [[University of Toronto]] has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]],  [[University of British Columbia]], and [[Dalhousie University]] all have a female faculty rate of 13%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
