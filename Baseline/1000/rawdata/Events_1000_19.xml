Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities.

The '''Asia Tour''' was planned to be the eleventh concert tour by Canadian singer Celine Dion. The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142420/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have marked Dion's first concerts in Asia since the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] in 2008. While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Background==
The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place.

==Commercial performance==
Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipjpn.co.jp/live/celine/ticket.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

According to a statement released by the singer:

{{cquote|"I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my [[René Angélil|husband]]'s healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children," Dion said in a statement.
"I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|title=Celine Dion announces show biz hiatus to focus on ailing husband|work=Celine: Las Vegas Official Website|publisher=[[AEG Live]]|accessdate=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813231818/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dion did not return to Asia for a performance until her [[Celine Dion Live 2018|2018 tour]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8455647/celine-dion-2018-asia-tour-dates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening acts==
In the official announcement for the Japan and Philippine tour, it was revealed that the impersonator [[Véronic DiCaire]] had been invited to join Celine as the opening act for these shows.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Set list==
The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', as well as fan favorites from the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dem_HyX9WcY&lt;/ref&gt; Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.

'''''Bloodline''''' &lt;ref&gt;''Bloodline'' DVD (Cinema Libre, 2008, 113 minutes).

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Burgess returned to the subject matter with ''The Bloodline of Christ'' that was shown in September 2013 on the [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] channel.

A '''common year''' is a [[calendar year]] with 365 [[day]]s.  More generally, a common year is one without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]].  The [[Gregorian calendar]], (like the earlier [[Julian calendar]]), employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the [[tropical year]], which does not contain an exact number of days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 [[week]]s and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the [[Revised Julian calendar]] (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]]. The following year, Monn was responsible for the design of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [[Costume Institute Gala]].&lt;ref name="NYTInf"&gt;{{cite news | last=Trebay| first=Guy| title =Influencers Are Forever| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =June 26, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/fashion/sundaystyles/influencers-are-forever.html| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, his clients included the Guggenheim Museum, [[LVMH]], and the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (among others).&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt; In November 2007, Monn designed the [[Frank Gehry]]-inspired Guggenheim International Gala at [[Pier 40 at Hudson River Park|Pier 40]].&lt;ref name="Bash"/&gt; He also designed the 100th anniversary celebration for the [[Plaza Hotel]] that year.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news | last=Huguenin| first=Patrick| title =Event planner's the life of the party| newspaper =[[New York Daily News]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =December 15, 2007 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/event-planner-life-party-article-1.276028| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Monn designed the [[White House]] State Dinner honoring then [[Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name="NYTShopping"/&gt; In November 2016, he released his book, ''David Monn: The Art of Celebrating'', which contains 360 pages of images and text about events he has planned and designed. The book's release date was marked with a party at the New York Public Library's main campus.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD"/&gt; In January 2017, Monn designed an opening candlelight dinner for the inauguration festivities of President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="WP90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTTrump"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bernstein| first=Jacob| title =How Anna Wintour's Longtime Party Planner Turned to Trump| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =January 18, 2017 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/fashion/inauguration-donald-trump-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html?_r=0| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. [http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%e2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters/ "Who’s getting the worst of natural disasters?"] 54Pesos.org, 4 October 2008  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903043315/http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%E2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters |date=3 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

'''Earth Hour''' is a worldwide movement organized by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).  The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earthhour.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started as a lights-off event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/Earth_Hour_Report_2017.pdf|title=Earth Hour 2017 report|author=|first=|date=|website=www.earthhour.org|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, in years when [[Holy Saturday]] falls on the last Saturday of March, Earth Hour is moved a week early rather than its traditional date.

Earth Hour 2018 was on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.

Earth Hour 2019 is scheduled for March 30, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/earthhour|title=Earth Hour (@earthhour) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Conception and start: 2004–2007===
In 2004, confronted with scientific findings, WWF Australia met with advertising agency [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Sydney]] to "discuss ideas for engaging Australians on the issue of climate change".&lt;ref name="earthhour1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |title=history |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103047/http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a large scale switch off was coined and developed in 2006, originally under the working title "The Big Flick".  WWF Australia presented their concept to [[Fairfax Media]] who, along with Sydney Lord Mayor [[Clover Moore]], agreed to back the event.&lt;ref name="earthhour1"/&gt; The 2007 Earth Hour was held on March 31 in Sydney, Australia at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, local time.

In October 2007 San Francisco ran its own "Lights Out" program inspired by the Sydney Earth Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/19/local/me-lightsout19 |title= Hour leg of darkness | newspaper = [[LA Times]] | date = September 19, 2007| author = John M. Glionna}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their successful event in October, the organizers decided to rally behind the Earth Hour being planned for March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightsoutsf.org/2007/10/24/moving-forward/ |title=Moving forward &amp;#124; Lights Out San Francisco |publisher=Lightsoutsf.org |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Hour 2008 was held internationally on March 29, 2008 from 8&amp;nbsp;pm to 9&amp;nbsp;pm local time, marking the first anniversary of the event. 35 countries around the world participated as official flagship cities and over 400 cities also supported. Landmarks around the world turned off their non-essential lighting for Earth Hour. Some websites took part in the event, with Google's homepage going "dark" on the day .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cities Shut Lights for Earth Hour 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/03/29/world-cities-shut-lights-for-earth-hour-2008/|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Zogby International online survey, 36 million Americans—approximately 16 percent of the United States adult population—participated in Earth Hour 2008. The survey also showed there was a 4 percentage point increase in the level of interest in environmental issues such as climate change and pollution directly after the event (73 percent pre-event versus 77 percent post-event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/21/idUS134396+21-Apr-2008+BW20080421 | title = 36 Million Americans Take Part in World Wildlife Fund's Global 'Earth Hour' | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = April 28, 2008 | accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dubai]], where external lighting on several major city landmarks was turned off and street lighting in selected areas was dimmed by 50%, the Electricity and Water Authority reported savings of 100 megawatt-hours of electricity. This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the hour began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/515051-dubai-slashes-energy-use-for-earth-hour?ln=en |title= Dubai slashes energy use for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Arabian Business]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best result was from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, with the city reporting a drop of 13% in electricity demand. However, national grid operator [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] reported that New Zealand's power consumption during Earth Hour was 335 megawatts, higher than the 328 megawatt average of the previous two Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4457620a11.html Lights on, power use up for Earth Hour].

Sydney, being the city that participated in both the 2007 and 2008 Earth Hours, cut electricity consumption by 8.4%. This is less than the previous year's 10.2%; however, Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley made the claim that after factoring [[margin of error]], the participation in this city was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/407472 |title= Where do we go from here? |work=[[Toronto Star]] |pages=A1, A17 |date= March 31, 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-31 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite official organizers WWF stating that the event is not about the reduction in electricity, a number of public institutions reported on electricity savings in their cities to see participation numbers. The [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], excluding the city of [[Toronto]], saw a decrease of 6% in electricity usage while [[Toronto]] saw a decrease of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) as many businesses darkened, including the landmark [[CN Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090329/earth_hour_090329/20090329?hub=TorontoHome |title=CTV Toronto – Earth Hour prompts 15 per cent T.O. power drop – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States polling showed that an estimated 90,000,000 Americans participated in Earth Hour as lights were turned off around the country, including landmarks such as [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Las Vegas Strip]], the [[Empire State Building]] and [[Niagara Falls]].

Some cities and landmarks took the opportunity to make more long-term adjustments to their everyday power consumption. In Chicago, the [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] (BOMA) developed lighting guidelines to reduce light pollution and reduce the carbon footprint of downtown buildings. [[Mount Rushmore]] in [[South Dakota]] started powering down each night around 9&amp;nbsp;pm instead of 11&amp;nbsp;pm.

In [[Vietnam]], electricity demand fell 500,000&amp;nbsp;kWh during Earth Hour 2010, which was three times larger than the first time the country joined the event in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[Tr&amp;#7903; v&amp;#7873;] |url=http://www.vnexpress.net/GL/Kinh-doanh/2010/03/3BA1A2E1/ |title=Tiết kiệm 450 triệu đồng trong giờ Trái đất |publisher=VnExpress |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
Earth Hour 2011 was the biggest year in the campaign's five-year history, reaffirming it as the largest ever voluntary action for the environment. In 2011, the tagline "Beyond the Hour" was adopted by organizers as a way to encourage people to take their commitment to the cause beyond the 60-minute event. Together with agency Leo Burnett, Earth Hour unveiled an updated planet themed logo that included a small plus symbol to the right of the signature "60" which was used in previous years. The 60+ symbol continues to be the main logo used by campaign organizers around the world.

Earth Hour 2011 took place in a record 5,251 cities and towns in 135 countries and territories on all seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |title=about |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330132314/http://www.earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an estimated reach of 1.8&amp;nbsp;billion people across the globe. In addition to this, the campaign's digital footprint grew to 91 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |title=#Earthhour Heats Up on Social Media |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628120010/http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Earth Hour 2011 was held on March 26, 2011 from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. IST, flagged off by the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]] [[Sheila Dikshit]] and Earth Hour 2011 Ambassador and Bollywood actress [[Vidya Balan]] in the presence of Jim Leape, Director General, WWF International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.indiaprwire.com/pressrelease/environmental-services/2011032881849.htm|title=India switches off on March 26 from 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm and beyond|publisher=India PRwire|date = March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosebowl channel suspended broadcasting from 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9.30&amp;nbsp;pm to mark the observance of Earth Hour.

The [[Philippines]], which has been an active participant of the Earth Hour, had an early "earth hour" when power was accidentally interrupted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatdulla and Villanueva|first=Rodina and Donabelle|title=Earth Hour comes early in Metro |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=670245&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=68&amp;newsalert|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plunging Metro Manila and nearby [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] into darkness. After power was restored, major buildings, commercial centers and residential areas in Metro Manila and most [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] continued to turn off their lights, while participating channels in the Philippines, ABS-CBN and Cartoon Network halted their transmissions for an hour.

30 provinces and cities in Vietnam took part in Earth Hour 2011 with the main event held in [[Nha Trang]]. The nation's electricity demand fell 400,000&amp;nbsp;kWh, one-fifth less than the previous year's. Vietnam managed to save 500 million [[VND]] (US$23,809) thanks to the saved power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |title=Vietnam Foreign Press Center – Vietnam saves 400,000 kWh of power during Earth Hour |publisher=Presscenter.org.vn |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322162359/http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube promoted the Earth Hour by changing its logo, and by adding a switch on/off feature near the title of each video, so that users could change the background colour from white to black.

One of the least co-operative areas traditionally has been [[Alberta]]; in 2008, Calgary's power consumption went up during Earth Hour. The trend continued in 2011 when [[Edmonton]]'s power usage also increased. While [[Calgary]]'s power usage went down in 2011 during the event, electricity officials could not distinguish their readings between normal usage and a conscious attempt to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/03/28/edmonton-earth-hour-failure.html |title=No Energy for Earth Hour |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of reduction in electricity use==
The Earth Hour Global FAQ page states:
{{Quote|Earth Hour does not purport to be an energy/[[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction]] exercise, it is a symbolic action. Therefore, we do not engage in the measurement of energy/carbon reduction levels for the hour itself. Earth Hour is an initiative to encourage individuals, businesses and governments around the world to take accountability for their [[ecological footprint]] and engage in dialogue and resource exchange that provides real solutions to our environmental challenges. Participation in Earth Hour symbolizes a commitment to change beyond the hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/celebrating-earth-hour |title=Celebrating Earth Hour |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 2014 study published in ''Energy Research and Social Science'' compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour in 10 countries, spanning 6 years, and found that the events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000474|title=The electricity impacts of Earth Hour: An international comparative analysis of energy-saving behavior|accessdate=May 31, 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.014|volume=2|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted the policy challenge of converting Earth Hour's short-term energy saving into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behaviour and investment.

==Criticism==

[[Bjørn Lomborg]], author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', wrote, "It is vital to make [[solar power|solar]] and [[green energy|other new technology]] cheaper than fossil fuels quickly so we can turn off carbon energy sources for a lot longer than one hour and keep the planet running... Fossil fuels literally gave us an enlightenment, by lighting our world and giving us protection from the fury of the elements.

* Some critics point out that the reduction in power consumption during Earth Hour itself is relatively insignificant.&lt;ref name = "rage against dimming"&gt;{{cite news | last = Soloman | first = David | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21694864-7583,00.html | title = Rage, rage against dimming of the light | publisher = The Australian | date = May 9, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Herald Sun]]'' equated the power savings in the Sydney central business district to "taking 48,613 cars off the road for 1 hour".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Australian columnist [[Andrew Bolt]] pointed out that "A cut so tiny is trivial – equal to taking six cars off the road for a year".&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Andrew (March 28, 2008).

*Other environmentalists have criticized Earth Hour's focus on individual behaviour, when a small number of fossil fuel companies have emitted the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainababble.fish/?p=101|title=Sustainababble Podcast - Earth Hour|last=|first=|date=29 March 2015|website=|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam McGibbon, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Earth Hour for releasing fossil fuel companies and politicians from their responsibility to deal with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/earth-hour-climate-change-environment-fossil-fuels-boycott-make-change-happen-really-care-a7643971.html|title=If you really care about climate change, boycott Earth Hour|date=2017-03-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that most candles are made from [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], a heavy [[hydrocarbon]] derived from [[crude oil]], a [[fossil fuel]], and that depending on how many candles a person burns (if one uses candles during Earth Hour), whether or not they normally use [[compact fluorescent light]] bulbs, and what source of energy is used to produce their electricity, in some cases, replacing light bulbs with candles will cause an increase, instead of a decrease, in carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/03/27/does-lighting-candles-for-earth-hour-defeat-the-purpose/ Does lighting candles for Earth Hour defeat the purpose?], ''Christian Science Monitor'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2009, one day after Earth Hour 2009, ''Dân Trí Daily News'' published an editorial expressing concern that many young people chose to drive around the darkened city of [[Hanoi]] for fun, exhausting petroleum instead of electricity and resulting in long traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dantri.com.vn/xa-hoi/cai-nhin-khac-trong-gio-trai-dat-316112.htm "Cái nhìn khác trong Giờ Trái đất"], ''Dân Trí Daily News'', by Cường Cao, date: 2009-03-29. {{vi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network criticized Earth Hour for "playing into the hands of (the critics of environmentalists)," as darkness is symbolic of fear and decay.  "The overwhelming need at the moment is to inspire ordinary people with a vision of a better world, to make them feel that action on climate change is utterly desirable and positive.... the cultural resonance (of Earth Hour) couldn't be any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions|title=Earth Hour: Turning out the lights plays into the hands of our critics|last=Marshall|first=George|date=2009-03-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has introduced an opposing ''Human Achievement Hour'' in celebration of human progress in various fields of industry, including technology, medicine, energy, and more. During this hour, the Institute suggests that people celebrate by using modern technology such as electricity, telecommunications and indoor plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/content/human-achievement-hour-2015|title=Human Achievement Hour 2015|work=cei.org|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2009, economist [[Ross McKitrick]] criticized the idea, saying, "Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century.[...] The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/earthhour.pdf | title=Earth Hour: A Dissent | last=McKitrick | first=Ross | authorlink=Ross McKitrick | year=2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' quoted Ross Hayman, head of media relations at the [[UK National Grid]], as saying "it could therefore result in an increase in carbon emissions" due to complications related to rapidly lowering then raising electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7527469/Earth-Hour-will-not-cut-carbon-emissions.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Earth Hour 'will not cut carbon emissions' | date=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2010, Rick Giles, president of [[ACT on Campus]], the youth wing of New Zealand's [[ACT Party]], appeared on the [[morning television]] show ''[[Sunrise (New Zealand TV program)|Sunrise]]'' to denounce Earth Hour and instead suggested the celebration of "Edison Hour". He argued that Earth Hour is an "anti-technology" cause, and that people will simply use candles instead, which is undesirable as they are petroleum-based. He argued that if we are heading for some kind of disaster, it makes sense to use technology to combat this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9MqNzQuuk |title=I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it |publisher=YouTube |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick said "I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it".
* The [[Ayn Rand Institute]] wrote, "Participants spend an enjoyable sixty minutes in the dark, safe in the knowledge that the life-saving benefits of industrial civilization are just a light switch away... Forget one measly hour with just the lights off. How about Earth Month... Try spending a month shivering in the dark without heating, electricity, refrigeration; without power plants or generators; without any of the labor-saving, time-saving, and therefore life-saving products that industrial energy makes possible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ari.aynrand.org/issues/science-and-industrialization/environmental-issues/The-Real-Meaning-of-Earth-Hour The Real Meaning of Earth Hour], by Keith Lockitch, Ayn Rand Institute, March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expressing sarcastic support for Earth Hour, the pro-carbon Carbon Sense Coalition wants Earth Hour to be renamed "Blackout Night", and to be held outside on the shortest and coldest day of the year "...to prepare our population for the dark days ahead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbon-sense.com/|title=The Carbon Sense Coalition|work=carbon-sense.com|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 2010 Earth Hour in the city of [[Uusikaupunki]] in Finland, a 17-year-old female motorcyclist hit a 71-year-old man, who was walking on the street instead of the sidewalk for an unknown reason. The man died from his injuries, while the motorcyclist and her passenger were uninjured. At the time of the accident the street lights had been turned off as part of the Earth Hour. The police stated that the lack of street lighting may have played a part in the accident, while the mayor believed the city's street lights would have been too dim to prevent it even if they had been on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mies kuoli moottoripyörän alle pimeystempauksen pimentämällä tiellä | work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] | url = &lt;!-- http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Mies+kuoli+moottoripy%C3%B6r%C3%A4n+alle+pimeystempauksen+piment%C3%A4m%C3%A4ll%C3%A4+tiell%C3%A4/1135255005911 --&gt;http://hommaforum.org/index.php?topic=25901.5;imode | date=March 27, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-28 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaupunki sammutti katuvalot Earth Hourin ajaksi – Mies jäi moottoripyörän alle pimeällä tiellä ja kuoli |work=[[Aamulehti]] |url=http://www.aamulehti.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/174590.shtml |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-28 |language=Finnish }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fictitious''' or '''fake entries''' are deliberately incorrect entries in [[reference work]]s such as [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[encyclopedia]]s, maps, and directories. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, [[trap street]], paper street, paper town, [[phantom settlement]], and [[:wikt:nihilartikel|nihilartikel]].&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nih1.htm |title=Nihilartikel |publisher=World Wide Words |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious entries are included either as a humorous hoax or as a '''copyright trap''' to reveal subsequent [[plagiarism]] or [[copyright infringement]]. 

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''Mountweazel'' was coined by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' based on a fictitious biographical entry in the 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=mountweazel&gt;Henry Alford, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford "Not a Word"], ''The New Yorker'' August 29, 2005 (accessed August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''nihilartikel'', combining the Latin ''nihil'' ("nothing") and German ''Artikel'' ("article"), is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"/&gt;

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent [[plagiarism]] if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers']] 1964 [[mathematical tables]]: "those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist".&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Comrie, ''Chambers's Shorter Six-Figure Mathematical Tables'', Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1964, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[trap street]]s may be included in a [[map]], or invented phone numbers in a [[telephone directory]].

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] or ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'', 796 F.Supp. 729, [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Greguras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301065154/http://oikoumene.com/databprotect.html U.S. Legal Protection for Databases], Presentation at the Technology Licensing Forum September 25, 1996. Archived March 1, 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Official sources ===
Most listings of the members of the [[German parliament]] feature the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]], allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious [[stone louse]] in Frankfurt.

=== Reference works ===
Fictitious entries in reference publications often occur in an attempt to catch plagiarism, such as: 

* In August 2005, ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gained media coverage&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word ''[[esquivalience]]'', defined as "the wilful avoidance of one's official responsibilities," which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy.
* [[Joel Whitburn]]'s pop chart research books say that [[Ralph Marterie]]'s version of "The Song of Love" peaked at No. 84 for the week ending December 26, 1955. However, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not put out an issue that week, and Marterie never recorded this song. A similar situation occurs in his compilation of ''Billboard''{{'}}s rock charts, where Whitburn includes the fictitious song "Drag You Down" by the equally non-existent group "The Cysterz".

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called [[phantom settlement]]s, [[trap streets]],&lt;ref&gt;SA Mathieson, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic "A sidestep in the right direction"], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; paper towns, cartographer's follies, or other names. They are intended to help unmask copyright infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770 Gizmodo: "Fake places that exist to catch copycats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1978, the fictional [[Ohio]] towns of [[Beatosu and Goblu]] were inserted into that year's official state of [[Michigan]] map as nods to the [[University of Michigan]] and its traditional rival, [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 |pages= 50–51 |edition=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional town of [[Agloe, New York]], was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The "town" is featured in the novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]].
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the [[continental divide]] in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The fiction was undiscovered for two years.&lt;ref name="Monmonier" /&gt;
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) obtained a  £20m out-of-court settlement from [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130521130707/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2001/march/centrica.html "Centrica and Ordnance Survey settle AA copyright case"], March 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Survey denied that it included "deliberate mistakes" in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the "fingerprints" which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark |title=Copying maps costs AA £20m |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictitious English town of [[Argleton]] was investigated by [[Steve Punt]] in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Punt P.I''. The programme concluded that the town's entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl ''Punt PI''], BBC Radio 4, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trivia books, etc. ===

*''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'' placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective [[Columbo]] for copy-trap purposes and then sued [[Trivial Pursuit]] (which based some of their questions and answers on the work), without success.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
Other examples of copyright infringement that do not fall under the above categories include: 

* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute ({{lang-sk|Slovenský hydrometeorologický ústav, short: SHMÚ}}) became suspicious that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was stealing their data. On August 7, 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for [[Chopok]] from 9.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1&amp;nbsp;°C. In a short time, the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;°C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4018705/shmu-podozrieva-meteo-ze-opisuje.html SHMÚ suspicious that meteo.sk is stealing their data] News portal SME.sk (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] in the Netherlands once deliberately included a false story about a fire in their radio newscast to see if [[Radio Veronica]] takes its news from the ANP. Several hours later, Radio Veronica also aired the story.
* [[Google]], alleging its search results for a misspelling of [[tarsorrhaphy]] started appearing in [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like "[[hiybbprqag]]", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=Glenn|title=On Google's Bing Sting|url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-accuses-microsoft-of-stealing-its-search-results-20110202-1acsl.html |title=Bing Copying Google?

== Scrutiny Checks ==
{{see also |List of scholarly publishing stings}}
Some publications such as those published by [[Harvard]] [[biologist]] [[John Bohannon]] are used to detect lack of [[replication crisis|academic scrutiny]], [[peer review | editorial oversight]], [[fraud]] and/or [[p hacking]] on the part of authors or their publishers.  Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

== Humorous hoaxes ==

Fictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as: 

* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].
* ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' (1887–1889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.
* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes’ ''Music Lovers’ Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[Māori language|Māori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because Māori does not use the letters J, X or Z).
* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942–1973).&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html "The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009. Retrieved March 27 2009 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first printing in 1980 of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a non-existent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for [[flute]]. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]]. The ''Pschyrembel'' entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

=== Practical jokes ===
Fictitious entries occasionally feature in other publications in an attempt to be humorous, such as:

*[[Rhinogradentia]] are a fictitious [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]], extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Harald Stümpke]]. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].
*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George "Punch" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016–2017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puzzles/games ===
Many publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:
*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, ''Blufftävlingen'', in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |title=Teknikmagasinet – meningen med livet |publisher=Teknik magasinet |language=sv |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |trans-title=Meaning of life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403100827/http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Muse (children's magazine)|Muse]]'', a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine's regular games.
*The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred "Muki the Wonder Dog", named after the authors' own dog

== Fictitious entries in fiction ==
Fictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:

* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, "The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country's literature.
* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry "Lillian Mountweazel" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred%20Worth%20lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that "information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.

* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co., 796 F. Supp. 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1992)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York Corporation that published and sold a New York City taxi driver's guide entitled ''Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide,'' attempted to sue Hagstrom Map Corporation who published and sold ''New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide,'' that Hagstrom allegedly violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for permanent injunction of their guide, damages, and attorney fees. However, this case was dismissed by the United States Federal Court because it found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "[[trap street]]") are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."
* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads. 

== Simple Errors ==
Often times there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], "words which have no real existence […] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors."&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat, The Transactions of the Philological Society 1885-7 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1885-7) Vol. II, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Game2: Winter''''' ({{lang-ru|Гаме2Винтер|italic=yes}}) was a social experiment and media stunt promoted as a [[Russia]]n survival [[reality television]] program produced by [[Novosibirsk]] entrepreneur [[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]] that was set to premiere in {{date|July 2017}}.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/15/russian-reality-tv-show-allow-rape-murder-game2-winter|title=Russian reality TV show Game2: Winter to 'allow' rape and murder in Siberia|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|date=2016-12-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show caught the attention of the press when the show stated that its rules would allow crimes such as rape and murder which sparked outrage online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://game2winter.ru/pravila|title=Правила Game2: Winter|work=Game2:Winter|access-date=2017-05-07|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/a-russian-reality-show-will-allow-murder-rape-anything-2016-12|title=A 'Hunger Games' style Russian reality show will allow 'murder, rape, anything'|work=Business Insider|last=Bulman|first=May|date=2016-12-16|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/sick-rules-for-new-russian-reality-tv-show-allow-contestants-to-fight-rape-and-murder-each-other/news-story/eb6a370c750cefc4e4e6de6e0fd3449f|title=Sick rules for new Russian reality TV show|last=Stewart|first=Will|date=2016-12-16|work=News.com.au|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been compared to a "real-life ''[[Hunger Games]]''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/09/a-real-life-hunger-games-is-coming-to-russia/|title=A real-life ‘Hunger Games’ is coming to Russia|last=Perez|first=Chris|date=2017-03-09|website=New York Post|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38342421/russia-does-the-hunger-games-for-real-in-siberia-but-no-guns-are-allowed|title=Russia does the Hunger Games for real in Siberia but no guns are allowed|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|language=en-GB|date=2016-12-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
30 participants, half men and half women, were expected to compete on a remote Siberian island in the [[Ob River]] for a 100 million rouble ($1.7 million) prize on a nine month survival mission.
All contestants were said to have signed death waivers and agreed not to hold the organisers accountable for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siberian-real-life-hunger-games-will-not-stop-rape-murder-fight-1-7m-prize-1611060|title=Siberian real-life Hunger Games will 'not stop' rape or murder in fight for $1.7m prize|last=Taylor|first=Alex|date=2017-03-11|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelled out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.
We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either, and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island.|author=[[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]], executive producer}}

However, [[Snopes]] found that 'Despite multiple misleading headlines, the waiver described by news outlets explicitly stated that contestants on the show would be obliged to "obey the laws of the Russian Federation".'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-reality-show-game2-winter-allows-rape-murder/|title=Russian Reality Show ‘Game2: Winter’ Allows Rape, Murder?

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

=== Geohazards in Earth's history ===
Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for the University of Tennessee. He is the former head coach of the [[University of Mississippi]]. Freeze served as the head football coach at [[Lambuth University]] from 2008 to 2009 and at [[Arkansas State University]] in 2011. He was previously a successful high school football coach at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he coached [[Michael Oher]] and [[Greg Hardy]]. He would later follow both of them to the University of Mississippi.

==Early life==
Freeze attended [[Senatobia Municipal School District|Senatobia High School]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], from which he graduated in 1992 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] and a minor in coaching and [[sports administration]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=204944063 Hugh Freeze Bio], Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Briarcrest Christian School===
In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as the football team's [[offensive coordinator]] and [[defensive backs coach]]. Freeze also served as dean of students.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giannotto |first1=Mike|title=At Briarcrest Christian School, Hugh Freeze's legacy is everywhere |url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/2017/07/24/briarcrest-christian-school-hugh-freezes-legacy-everywhere/506677001/ |work=The Commercial Appeal|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was promoted to head coach. Freeze ran the no huddle spread offense and led his team to the state championship twice, in 2002 and 2004, and the regional championship each year from 1995 to 1998 and in 2001 and 2002. He received Region 8-AA Coach of the Year honors five times and Associated Press Coach of the Year honors six times.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In ten years at Briarcrest, Freeze was 94–30 as head coach (.785 winning percentage) and 126–37 overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213161936/http://briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |archivedate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze was depicted in [[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game|the book]] and motion picture ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'', about one of his former players, current free agent offensive tackle [[Michael Oher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40483873/ns/sports-college_football/ Oher's HS Coach Gets Top Job at Arkansas State], NBC Sports, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305–63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/ncaafootball/hugh-freeze-coach-at-ole-miss-follows-an-unlikely-blueprint.html|title=Hugh Freeze, Coach at Ole Miss, Follows an Unlikely Blueprint|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his dismissal from [[Ole Miss]], some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heim|first1=Mark|title=Hugh Freeze stories emerge from former female students at Briarcrest Christian|url=https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/07/hugh_freeze_stories_emerge_fro.html|work=AL.com|date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Josh|title=Who is Hugh Freeze?

===Ole Miss===
In 2005, the [[University of Mississippi]] hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the [[tight ends coach]] and [[recruiting coordinator]], positions he held through 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|that season]], he replaced head coach [[Ed Orgeron]] on an interim basis before the hiring of [[Houston Nutt]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/13665882.html |title=Nutt Has Long List for New OC |date=January 9, 2008 |work=WTOK.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that eventually went to [[Kent Austin]].

===Lambuth===
In January 2008, [[Lambuth University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambutheagles.com/article/252.php Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach], Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he led Lambuth to an 8–4 record and a first round loss in the NAIA playoffs, marking their first appearance in the playoffs since 2004 under then head coach Vic Wallace. He was considered for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's head coaching position following the 2008 season, but remained at Lambuth University for another season and compiled a 20–5 overall record, and defeating opponents 41–17 on average. In 2009, he led the Eagles to their best regular season record in school history with an unblemished 11–0 mark. Lambuth advanced to the second round of the NAIA playoffs for first time in 11&amp;nbsp;years—having won one game before suffering elimination to finish 12–1 as the sixth-ranked team in the NAIA.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Arkansas State===
In 2010, he joined the staff at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] as offensive coordinator after a brief stint as offensive coordinator at [[San Jose State University]] under [[Mike MacIntyre]]. The Red Wolves finished with a 4–8 record, but their offensive rankings jumped from 95th in total offense and 90th in scoring offense in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] to 43rd and 46th, respectively. The Red Wolves' offense broke nine school records including total plays (856), first downs (262), pass attempts (438), pass completions (266), completion percentage (.607), passing yards (3,057), passing yards per game (254.8), and passing touchdowns (23). The Red Wolves' offense averaged 403.4 yards per game, eclipsing over 300 yards all 12 times it took the field for the first time in the history of the program. A-State posted at least 400 yards of total offense in seven games during the 2010 campaign, the most ever as an NCAA FBS member, all in his first year as offensive coordinator. After [[2010 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|the season]], Freeze was promoted to replace head coach [[Steve Roberts (American football)|Steve Roberts]].&lt;ref name=hired&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5875374&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines Hugh Freeze hired at Arkansas St.], ESPN, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his only season as head coach at Arkansas State, he led the Red Wolves to a 10–2 record and their first Sun Belt Conference title since 2005. The Red Wolves' offense averaged 447.8 ypg (28th nationally, 1st in Sun Belt Conference) including 293.6 ypg passing and 154.2 ypg rushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109125126/http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze left Arkansas State before the Arkansas State's appearance in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]] following the season.

===Ole Miss===
On December 5, 2011, Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the University of Mississippi. During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to "retire at Ole Miss." He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FreezeOMHire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugh Freeze is Rebels' new coach |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7319777/hugh-freeze-mississippi-rebels-emotional-accepting-coaching-job |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6–6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41–24 victory over Mississippi State in the [[Egg Bowl]]. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38–17 to finish 7–6.

Freeze received national attention on [[National Signing Day]] 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings?class=2013 |title=2013 Football Class Rankings |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org/2014/01/13/hugh-freeze-named-grant-teaff-coach-of-the-year/ |title=Hugh Freeze named coach of the year by Fellowship of Christian Athletes |work=FCA.org |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7–0 start, the program's best start since the [[Johnny Vaught]] era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]]–their first major bowl appearance since the [[1970 Sugar Bowl]], and easily the biggest bowl they had attended since Vaught's tenure.

On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43–37, in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], making Freeze only the third head coach, along with [[Les Miles]] and [[Steve Spurrier]], to defeat a [[Nick Saban]]-coached team in back-to-back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96–'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to #3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the [[2016 Sugar Bowl]], where they won 48–20 over [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]]. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll—their first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969.

In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous "impermissible benefits" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/2/22/14703296/ole-miss-ncaa-allegations-list-2017|title=The updated list of 21 NCAA allegations against Ole Miss football|author=Morgan Moriarty|publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laremy Tunsil says he took money from coach at Ole Miss |work=ESPN |date=April 28, 2016 |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15424437/2016-nfl-draft-laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-cash-ole-miss-rebels-coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017—three months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived—Ole Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations/&gt;

On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, [[Houston Nutt]], sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request for calls Freeze made on his university-issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-bc-fbc--mississippi-freezes-downfall-20170721-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female [[escort service]], and alerted Ole Miss officials about it.  Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2017/07/20/ole-miss-coach-hugh-freeze-called-number-tied-escort-service/498056001/|title=Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze made call to number tied to escort service|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as "a concerning pattern" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor [[Jeff Vitter]] and athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the [[morals clause]] of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator [[Matt Luke (American football)|Matt Luke]] was named interim coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited |title=Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze resigns; escort-service calls cited |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |author-link=Mark Schlabach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona Hotshots (AAF)===
On October 11, 2018, Freeze was named as the Offensive Coordinator for the [[Arizona Hotshots]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]].

An '''international incident''' is a seemingly relatively small or limited action or clash that results in a wider dispute between two or more [[nation-states]]. International incidents can arise from unanticipated actions involving citizens, government officials, or armed units of one or more nation-states, or out of a deliberate but small provocative action by [[espionage]] agents of one nation-state, or by [[terrorists]], against another nation-state.

An international incident usually arises during a time of relative [[peace]] between nation-states, and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating [[skirmish]]es between nation-states generally are not considered international incidents; however, [[terrorist]] actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between nation-states, or organizations opposing nation-states.

Wars have often been provoked by international incidents, and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts to prevent international incidents from growing into full-scale armed conflicts often have been unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[League of Nations]] was established to help nations who were parties to an international incident achieve a solution to the incident through diplomatic means. Initially, the League of Nations had some success in working to find diplomatic solutions, however the failure of the League of Nations to prevent [[World War II]] resulted in the disbandment of the League of Nations in favor of the [[United Nations]]. As with its predecessor, the United Nations provides a means by which nations involved in an international incident can work to resolve the matter diplomatically rather than through the use of force.

The term is also applied to various incidents that can disrupt international [[commerce]], and to [[celebrities]] or other well-known people who commit [[gaffe]]s or otherwise act inappropriately, causing the [[Mass media|press]] and sometimes governments to criticize their actions.

The [[International Court of Justice]] keeps a list of legal disputes between nation-states, many of which result from international incidents. The [[Royal Mail]] of the [[United Kingdom]] keeps a list on its website of current international incidents that might disrupt mail service.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/service-update/international Royal Mail – International Incident Bulletin].  Retrieved March 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents listed may or may not conform to the definitions given above.

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Today, the movement has grown into a network of 113 countries. All together, 14 million participants have been engaged in movement's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalev Leetaru: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/07/30/how-pokemon-and-location-based-augmented-reality-could-save-the-planet/#4f804c9766cc "How Pokémon And Location-Based Augmented Reality Could Save The Planet"] Forbes, 2016-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Do It! World is an accredited member of the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]].

Since 2017, the movement uses [[W sign]] aka Three Fingers Up as a symbol. 

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup 2012==
In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world. Each group or organisation was leading the cleanup action in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/countries |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==
[[File:Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015.jpg|thumb|Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015]]
The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

In 2013, 375,000 cleaned up the country in '''Bulgaria''' in a one-day country cleanup action (13,9% of country's population).

In 2012, 210,000 people (10% of country's population) cleaned up '''Latvia''' from illegal waste in just one day.

'''Let's do it 2008''' ({{lang-et|Teeme ära 2008}}) is the largest campaign to activate civic society in [[Estonia]] since the [[Singing Revolution]] in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} '''[[Let's Do It! World]]''' is a global campaign for cleaning all countries that grew out of Let's do it 2008. 

Over 50,000 people, or approximately 4% of the population of 1.3 million, participated in the cleanup of the forests and countryside, which would be proportionally equal to 15.3 million people in the United States, or 57 million people in India. Momentum for the event was built up with a media campaign from October 2007 to April 2008. The action was carried out during one day on 3 May 2008. More than 10,000 tons of garbage were removed from the country's forest in about 5 hours for less than 500,000 euros. Under normal circumstances it would have taken the government 3 years and 22.5 million euros to accomplish a similar feat.

==Organizers==
The initial team was:
* [[Rainer Nõlvak]]
* [[Toomas Trapido]]
* [[Kadri Allikmäe]]
* [[Henri Laupmaa]]

The group met at 29 August 2007 as recorded in the first protocol.

Other people of the main team:
* [[Ahti Heinla]]
* [[Eva Truuverk]]
* [[Tiina Urm]]
* [[Anneli Ohvril]]
* [[Jüri-Ott Salm]]

==Spreading the model==
* Since then Latvia has copied the event in September 2008 with 40,000 volunteers. Lithuania and Latvia did larger scale actions in April 2009 with 150,000 volunteers.
* The international cleanup action was announced in March 2009 and the city of Bengaluru (Bangalore) in India did similar action on 16 August 2009.
* On 17 April 2010 a similar event was organized in Slovenia - ''[[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!]]'' (''Očistimo slovenijo v enem dnevu'') with 12% of population participating (250.000 volunteers).
* In 2010 it is planned by Portugal (20 March), Romania (September), Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, Italy, France, Indian city of Delhi, capital of Ukraine Kyiv and some other Ukrainian towns.

This has led to the international action "[[Let's Do It! World]]" and the creation of [[World Cleanup Day]].

On June 12, 1937 over 1,500 children and 75 tutors (teachers, doctors, and nurses) left the Port of [[Santurtzi]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] province of [[Bizkaia]] on board the ship "Habana." Similarly, nearly 4,000 children were evacuated to the United Kingdom, also on the "Habana", with the [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS Hood]] as an escort.

* September 1939 – The [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II]]; at the outset of [[World War II]], [[London]] and major [[Great Britain|British]] cities were evacuated, with 1.5 million displaced in the first three days of the official evacuation.

* Between December 10 and 24, 1950, over 100,000 [[United Nations|UN]] troops who were cut off by the [[China|Chinese]] intervention forces in Northern Korea, along with an even larger number of civilian refugees, were evacuated from the [[North Korea]]n port of [[Hungnam]] during the [[Korean War]].
* July–August 1971 – 18 million people migrated from [[Bangladesh]] (then known as [[East Pakistan]]) to [[India]] to escape the military forces of [[Pakistan]] (then known as [[West Pakistan]]). This was the largest and bloodiest exodus in human history, with 4 million dead.

'''Metro Broadcast''' Ltd. is a UK-based [[Event management|corporate event]] supplier with its Head Office in London and a satellite operation in Scotland with offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.  The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[WPP plc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/companies/metro/ |first=Mary |last=Metcalfe |title=Metro |access-date=27 August 2018 |work=[[WPP plc]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180218060757/http://www.wpp.com:80/wpp/companies/metro/ |archive-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metro Broadcast is also the resident technical production supplier at several London event venues such as [[30 Euston Square]], a conference venue based at [[Royal College of General Practitioners|The Royal College of General Practitioners]], and one of Europe’s largest conference hotels, [[Hilton London Metropole]].  Metro’s production team also manages the https://www.youtube.com/yt/space/london/.   Additionally, the company is a preferred event supplier at some of London’s most precious and historic buildings including [[Somerset House]], [[Natural history museum|the Natural History Museum]], [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Worshipful Company of Barbers#Barber-Surgeons.27 Hall and Arms|Barber-Surgeons’ Hall]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle Temple Hall]].

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological hazard]]s can refer to a diverse array of [[disease]], [[infection]], [[infestation]] and [[invasive species]].

Many geophysical hazards are related;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Joel C.|last2=Malamud|first2=Bruce D.|title=Reviewing and visualizing the interactions of natural hazards|journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]]|date=December 2014|volume=52|issue=4|pages=680–722|doi=10.1002/2013RG000445|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000445/abstract|bibcode=2014RvGeo..52..680G}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[submarine earthquake]]s can cause [[tsunami]]s, and [[hurricane]]s can lead to [[coastal flood]]ing and [[coastal erosion|erosion]]. Floods and wildfires can result from a combination of geological, [[hydrology|hydrological]], and climatic factors. It is possible that some natural hazards are intertemporally correlated as well.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Philip E.|last2=Bresnock|first2=Anne E.|title=Are Natural Hazards Temporally Random?|journal=[[Applied Geography]]|date=1 January 1985|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1016/0143-6228(85)90002-5|ssrn=1679224}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the distinction between a natural ''hazard'' and a [[natural disaster|natural ''disaster'']] is that the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] was a disaster, whereas living on a [[fault (geology)|fault]] line is a hazard.

==Geological hazards==
{{Main article|Geohazard}}

===Avalanche===
An avalanche occurs when a large snow (or rock) mass slides down a mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow avalanches|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science/avalanches.html|website=All about snow|publisher=National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by the size or severity of consequences resulting from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Public Avalanche Danger Scale|url=http://www.avalanche.org/danger_card.php|website=Avalanche.org|publisher=American Avalanche Association|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake===
{{See also|Lists of earthquakes|Soil liquefaction}}
[[Image:Sanfranciscoearthquake1906.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco]] was devastated by an [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]] in 1906]]
An [[earthquake]] is the sudden relof energy stored as lithospheric stress that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest with a shaking or displacement of the ground; when the [[earthquake]] occurs on the seafloor, the resulting displacement of water can sometimes result in a [[tsunami]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simkin, Tom|display-authors=3|author2=Tilling, Robert I.|author3=Vogt, Peter R.|author4=Kirby, Stephen H.|author5=Kimberly, Paul|author6=Stewart, David B.|title=This Dynamic Planet: World map of volcanoes, earthquakes, impact craters, and plate tectonics|date=2006|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey Map I-2800|isbn=1-411-30959-6|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|accessdate=18 July 2014|archiveurl=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|archivedate=7 Jan 2014|format=map}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.

===Coastal erosion===
[[Coastal erosion]] is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents that can be influenced by tides and storm surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komar|first1=Paul D.|title=CRC handbook of coastal processes and erosion|date=1983|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9780849302251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal erosion can result from long-term processes (see also [[beach evolution]]) as well as from episodic events such as [[tropical cyclone]]s or other severe storm events.

===Lahar===
A [[lahar]] is a type of natural event closely related to a [[volcanic eruption]], and involves a large amount of material originating from an eruption of a glaciated volcano, including mud from the melted ice, [[rock (geology)|rock]], and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] sliding down the side of the [[volcano]] at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people, and form [[flood basalt]].
This is based on natural events.

===Landslide===
A [[landslide]] is a mass displacement of sediment, usually down a slope. It can be caused by pressure pulling natural objects down a declining hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Nicholas K.|title=Geohazards: natural and human|date=1995|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780023229923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinkhole===
A [[sinkhole]] is a localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure such as a [[cave]]. Although rare, large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures.

===Volcanic eruption===
[[Image:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]]]]
A [[volcanic eruption]] is the point in which a [[volcano]] is active and releases its power, and the eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small eruptions which occur in places like [[Kilauea]] in [[Hawaii]], to megacolossal eruptions (where the volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of material) from supervolcanoes like [[Lake Taupo]] (26,500 years ago) and [[Yellowstone Caldera]]. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], 70 to 75 thousand years ago, a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] event at [[Lake Toba]] reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in [[human evolution]]. Some eruptions form [[pyroclastic flows]], which are high-temperature clouds of ash and steam that can travel down mountainsides at speed exceeding an airliner.

==Meteorological or climate hazards==
[[Image:Young steer after blizzard - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Young steer after a blizzard, March 1966]]

===Blizzard===
A blizzard is a severe winter storm with icy and windy conditions characterized by low temperature, strong wind and heavy snow.

===Drought===
A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water.
Scientists warn that [[global warming]] and  [[climate change]] may result in more extensive [[drought]]s in coming years. These extensive droughts are likely to occur within the African continent due to its very low precipitation levels and high temperatures.

===Hailstorm===
A [[hail]]storm is a natural hazard where a thunderstorm produces numerous [[hailstone]]s which damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be especially devastating to [[farm]] fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment.

===Heat wave===
A [[heat wave]] is a hazard characterized by [[heat]] which is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of [[weather]] events to take place, and may include [[temperature inversion]]s, [[katabatic winds]], or other phenomena. There is potential for longer-term events causing [[global warming]], including [[stadial]] events (the opposite to glacial "ice age" events), or through human-induced climatic warming.

===Cyclonic storm===
Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Katrina]]]]
[[Hurricane]], [[tropical cyclone]], and [[typhoon]] are different names for the cyclonic [[storm]] system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated [[water]] that comes off of the [[ocean]] and becomes a [[storm]]. The [[Coriolis effect]] causes the storms to spin.{{convert|74|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Hurricane'' is used for these phenomena in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]s, ''tropical cyclone'' in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], and ''typhoon'' in the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

===Ice storm===
An [[ice storm]] is a particular [[weather]] event in which precipitation falls as [[ice]], due to [[atmospheric|atmosphere]] conditions. It causes damage.

===Tornado===
A [[tornado]] is a natural disaster resulting from a [[thunderstorm]]. Tornadoes are violent, rotating columns of air which can blow at speeds between {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and possibly higher. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large [[tornado outbreak]]s associated with [[supercell]]s or in other large areas of thunderstorm development. [[Waterspout]]s are tornadoes occurring over tropical waters in light rain conditions.

===Climate change===

[[Climate change]] can increase or decrease weather hazards, and also directly endanger property due to [[sea level rise]] and biological organisms due to [[habitat]] destruction.

===Geomagnetic storm===

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disrupt or damage technological infrastructure, and disorient species with [[magnetoception]].

==Flood==
A [[flood]] results from an overflow of water beyond its normal confines of a body of water such as a lake, or the accumulation of water over land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Flood|website=Meteorology glossary|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildfire==
[[Wildfire]] is a fire that burns in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner. Wildfires can result from natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or from human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildfire|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/wildfire|website=Cambridge dictionaries online|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[Disease]] is a natural hazard that can be enhanced by human factors such as [[urbanization]] or poor [[sanitation]].  Disease affecting multiple people can be termed an [[outbreak]] or [[epidemic]].

In some cases, a hazard exists in that a human-made defense against disease could fail, for example through [[antibiotic resistance]].

==Multi-hazard analysis==
Each of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence, hazard frequency and [[return period]], and measures of intensity and impact. These complexities result in "single-hazard" assessments being commonplace, where the hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a "multi-hazard" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0294-2 | doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0294-2 | volume=64 | title=Challenges of analyzing multi-hazard risk: a review | journal=Natural Hazards | pages=1925–1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;

Many examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an [[earthquake]] may trigger [[landslides]], whereas a [[wildfire]] may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and [[anthropic]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-3049.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[groundwater]] abstraction may trigger [[groundwater-related subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthgwlandsubside.html|title=Land Subsidence|work=USGS Water Science School|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective [[hazard analysis]] in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of [[disaster risk reduction]]) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|url=http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/283/2007/|journal=Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.|volume=7|issue=2|pages=283–288|doi=10.5194/nhess-7-283-2007|issn=1684-9981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''ThinkHazard!'' is an online tool that provides an overview of the hazards from eight natural hazards (river floods, earthquakes, water scarcity, cyclones, coastal floods, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides) developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery in partnership with other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkhazard.org/ ThinkHazard!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gfdrr.org/ Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International campaigns==
In 2000, the [[United Nations]] launched the [[International Early Warning Programme]] to address the underlying causes of vulnerability and to build disaster-resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of [[disaster risk reduction]] as an integral component of [[sustainable development]], with the goal of reducing human, economic and environmental losses due to hazards of all kinds (UN/ISDR, 2000). 

The 2006-2007 United Nations International Disaster Reduction Day theme was “Disaster reduction education begins in school”. The Foundation of Public Safety Professionals launched an international campaign with an international open essay or documentary competition.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gamma-ray bursts might have regulated the advent of intelligent life]]
'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B.

This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‘Tokyo bureau’ refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‘Washington bureau’ is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won’t Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47915">''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' is an online team-based [[first person shooter]] developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], and released worldwide in May 2016. Normally played in matches of six-vs-six, players select from one of [[Characters of Overwatch|29 heroes]], broadly classified into the three categories of Tank, Damage, and Support, and work with their team to attack or defend map objectives. Each hero has a unique set of weapons, abilities, and skills, which players can coordinate to overpower the other team. ''Overwatch'' supports both casual and ranked matchmaking, as well as a rotating set of arcade modes, and the game has since become a popular [[eSport]], featuring a professional [[Overwatch League]] that started in 2018. The game has been both a critical and financial success for Blizzard, exceeding over 30 million players and obtaining over $1 billion in revenue within its first year.

To support ongoing interest in the game, Blizzard has run several seasonal events, typically coinciding with worldwide events and holidays. These events last for two to three weeks, updating [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to incorporate elements of that theme, and provide new game modes along with the opportunity to acquire unique cosmetic options. Players keep their earned character cosmetic options after the event ends, but the rest of the themed elements return to normal.

== Overview ==
Over the course of developing ''Overwatch'', Blizzard opted against using a [[downloadable content]] model to extend the game and bring post-sale revenues, as they had developed the game around the mechanic of allowing players to switch out to new heroes during the course of a match as to meet current strategic conditions; by requiring players to purchase new heroes, such a model would have hampered this approach.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: Development"/&gt; Instead, they opted to include [[microtransaction]]s through which players can buy [[loot box]]es, which contain four randomized cosmetic items, including characters skins, victory poses, emotes, spray tags, highlight introductions, and player icons. This allowed them to create an incentivized [[experience level|level progression system]] that would reward players with a loot box for every level they earned from experience gained in playing matches.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Progression"/&gt; Working alongside this, players can earn in-game coins through some loot box rewards or as a consolation prize for receiving a duplicate loot box reward. These coins can be used to purchase any of the available cosmetic items (with the exception of player icons), the cost reflecting the rarity of obtaining the item through a loot box.

Beginning in August 2016, Blizzard began introducing seasonal events, starting with the Summer Games event which corresponded with the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. ''Overwatch''{{'}}s director Jeff Kaplan said the goal of these seasonal events was to make the game "feel alive", correlating with real-world events.&lt;ref name="VG247: Seasonal"/&gt; The company has a history of creating in-game seasonal events, such as the Valentine's Day and New Year's events in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Other competitor games, such as ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', also implement in-game seasonal events.&lt;ref name="IGN: more"/&gt;

Events have generally included at least one new game mode, which typically is only available to play while that event is active; one exception is the "Capture the Flag" mode introduced during the Chinese New Year event in early 2017, which has been brought back to the game as a permanent feature in the game's casual Arcade matchmaking mode. Players are typically rewarded with loot boxes for playing matches in these seasonal game modes, and the game offers unique [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and associated cosmetic rewards for completing certain goals within them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/173914/overwatch-uprising-achievements-how-to-unlock-all-the-new-event-sprays#.m0kj9F4sw|title=How to unlock all the new 'Overwatch' sprays during the Uprising event|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to new games modes, these seasonal events include unique cosmetic items that can be obtained primarily during the event. Blizzard develops a large amount of content for these events, not all which ends up available to players.&lt;ref name="USGamer: Events 2017"/&gt; Initially, these items could only be obtained through event-themed loot boxes that are guaranteed to contain at least one event-themed item, which could either be earned through leveling up, completing the event game modes, or through microtransactions;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer"/&gt; however, in response to player feedback and avoid an apparent [[paywall]] access to these items, Blizzard allowed players to purchase these items with in-game currency at a higher cost than a non-event item of the same rarity, starting from the second seasonal event onward.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer Problem"/&gt; When the event is completed, the themed loot boxes and cosmetic items are no longer are available until the event is run again. However, players retain and can use all unique event items they have earned after the event.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; Not all event items will be limited in this manner, as Blizzard plans to have certain event items be possible loot obtained from a regular loot box in the future.&lt;ref name="Kotatu: Special Skins to Regular Loot"/&gt;

Several seasonal events, such as Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland, have recurred. However, on bringing these events back, the development team has added new changes to the event to keep them fresh and to reflect any new heroes or other content added to the game since the previous event's occurrence; for example, the 2017 Halloween "Junkenstein's Revenge" included a new endless mode and support for some of the newer heroes.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Returning Seasonal"/&gt; Recurring events also feature new themed cosmetic items for these recurring events, along with the return of the previous cosmetics which can be found in the event loot boxes or bought for a reduced coin amount.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; Not all seasonal events are designed for recurrence, such as the lore-heavy "Uprising" event which took place in April 2017. Kaplan said that Blizzard has plans as to how these events will evolve in the future.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2016 events ==
=== Summer Games ===

In August 2016, Blizzard released its first seasonal event in celebration of the concurrent [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Both Blizzard's "Summer Games" and the Olympics ran throughout the month. Summer Games added 100 new cosmetic character options and a new game mode, Lúcioball.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt;

Lúcioball was designed as a futuristic [[soccer]] game in which two teams of three Lúcio characters attempt to push a ball into their opponents' goal. Played in four-minute matches on the special stadium map, Estádio das Rãs, players use two kinds of attacks to control the ball's movements: primarily, a melee attack and a secondary, powerful sonic boom that could knock back opponents as well (frequently called "booping" by players). Players can also use the level's environmental perks (e.g., jump pads and speed-boosting walls) to secure strategic advantage on the field.&lt;ref name="IGN: Summer release"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' felt that the mode felt closer to a "multiplayer carnival game than a fleshed-out, standalone mode".&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror ===

Blizzard released its second seasonal event for [[Halloween]], which lasted throughout the month of October 2016. It included over 100 new cosmetic items (in [[jack-o'-lantern]]-themed loot boxes) and the game's first [[player versus environment|game mode against computer players]], Junkenstein's Revenge.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt; Several characters received new Halloween-themed cosmetic skins. ''PC Gamer'' wrote that they were among the game's best add-ons,&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Halloween"/&gt; and ''[[Kill Screen]]'' felt the new character skins were much more enjoyable compared to those offered for the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="Kill Screen: Halloween"/&gt; Players could now purchase the seasonal add-ons with in-game credits (at a premium), in response to criticism Blizzard received from players during the Summer Games.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Terror now"/&gt;

In Junkenstein's Revenge, four players [[co-op video game|cooperatively]] guard a castle door from oncoming waves of enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. Set in a themed section of the game's Eichenwalde map, players select a [[difficulty level]] and choose between the characters [[Ana (Overwatch)|Ana]], [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]], [[McCree (Overwatch)|McCree]], and [[Soldier:_76]], before fighting off approaching mindless "zomnic" drones, long-range "zombardiers," exploding tires, and costumed versions of the characters [[Reaper (Overwatch)|Reaper]], [[Roadhog (Overwatch)|Roadhog]], [[Symmetra (Overwatch)|Symmetra]], [[Mercy (Overwatch)|Mercy]], and [[Junkrat]] (as the titular Dr. Junkenstein).&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; The game mode includes new voice work and is based on a companion comic book released concurrently.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt;

The new mode was generally praised by commentators. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that the event resembled a similar event run on the team shooter ''Team Fortress 2'' since 2012. Though the reviewer found the Junkenstein mode pleasant, he wrote that in comparison to ''Team Fortress 2''{{'s}} [[Mann vs. Machine]] mode, Junkenstein felt "shallow" and similar to Lúcioball in its simplistic map flow, giving little room for player movement. He also wondered why the mode was limited to four specific characters.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Junkenstein"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Robert Purchase found the event fun and considered it a good distraction from ''Overwatch''{{'}}s main modes, but also recognized that if it was kept on after the Halloween Terror event, it would become a stale game mode.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Halloween"/&gt; Heather Alexandra for  ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the mode demonstrated that a co-operative player-versus-environment mode would fit well as a permanent feature within ''Overwatch'' as it required good team coordination to complete more challenging matches.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween"/&gt;

The event ended a few hours earlier than had been planned, leaving some players upset as they were waiting for as long as possible collecting the themed loot boxes in-game before trying to spend in-game coins or purchasing loot boxes to get the cosmetic items they were missing.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Halloween early end"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland ===
The holiday-themed Winter Wonderland event ran for the latter half of December 2016 through the first days of the new year. Like previous events, it added over 100 themed cosmetic items for players to obtain via loot boxes or in-game currency, as well as provided snowy versions of two of the game's maps.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; One cosmetic items included the first Legendary skin for Mei since the game's release, a Santa-like outfit; with this skin equipped, it also changed the appearance of Mei's Cryo-Freeze from a simple block of ice to a frozen snowman.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Players criticized the skin, feeling that it did not vary as much from Mei's normal outfits and appeared to be a simple recoloring of her default skin, in comparison to what other characters' Legendary skins had been.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei"/&gt; Blizzard admitted that their "'cool meter' was off" when they designed this skin, believing that players would take to the Cryo-Freeze effect as a reason to value the skin. Blizzard stated that they had plans for another Mei Legendary skin, along the lines of what players would expect, in early 2017.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter Mei Response"/&gt;

The event featured a new [[deathmatch]] mode called "Mei's Snowball Offensive". The mode took place on the smaller Ecopoint: Antartica map, introduced in the previous months for standard deathmatch play. Six players each play Mei, but where her Endothermic Blaster, which normally fires a stream of damaging cold, can only fire a single snowball. Players must find a snowball pile scattered around the map to reload the weapon. Further, her Ultimate ability allows her to fire a machine-gun-like string of snowballs for a brief period. Otherwise, Mei's other abilities (Ice Wall and Cyro-Freeze) remain the same. A single snowball hit kills the struck until the round is complete.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Winter"/&gt; Kotaku claims this mode was generally not well received by players as the act of having to reload the Blaster made one too vulnerable, and with the [[permadeath]] mechanic in play, the mode was not fun nor captured the spirit of a snowball fight.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter"/&gt;

== 2017 events ==
=== Year of the Rooster ===
A [[Chinese New Year]]-themed event launched a few days before the actual holiday on January 28, 2017, and centered on celebrating the Year of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]. As with past events, the Chinese New Year event introduced over 100 new cosmetic items, including the promised new Legendary skin for Mei to make up for the poorly-received one she had gotten during the Winter Wonderland event.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY"/&gt; Other skins for Roadhog, Reinhardt, Winston and Zenyatta alluded to the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Leak"/&gt;

The event introduced the first [[Capture the Flag]] mode for ''Overwatch'' called "Capture the Rooster"; Blizzard had looked at adding such a mode for a few years during ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development but had difficulty with the mechanics due to the vastly different set of abilities offered by the characters that could imbalance the mode towards fast-moving characters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF"/&gt; Played on the Lijiang Tower map, normally used for Control modes, each team has a flag near their base. To capture the other opponent's flag, a character must stay near the flag and not take damage for a few seconds. Once they have taken the flag, they then must return it to their team's base, scoring a point if they do so. If they die while bringing the flag back, either a teammate can try to capture it, or the opposing team must stay near the flag, avoiding taking damage for a few seconds, to return it to their base. Teams can score with the opposing team's flag even if their team's flag has been taken. The first team to three scores, or the team with the highest score after five minutes, wins the match.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CNY Start"/&gt;

Following the event, Blizzard introduced a more general Capture the Flag mode, playable on any of the Control maps, into the Arcade modes as well as making it an option for custom games with several adjustable parameters.&lt;ref name="Polygon: CTF added"/&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Uprising ===
Uprising ran for most of the month of April 2017, and was the first seasonal event not tied to any real-world event, but instead used to expand the lore of ''Overwatch''. The story centered around one of the last official missions of the Overwatch team before they were disbanded—having to end the threat of a hostile Omnic force known as the Null Sector in its attack on the citizens of London—; which also happened to be [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]]'s first mission. Over 100 new cosmetic items were added with this event, many based on the uniforms and backstory of the original Overwatch forces.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt; A digital comic retelling this story was released alongside the event.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt; According to Kaplan, the Uprising event was something Blizzard felt had been asked for by players since they started offering the seasonal events. Players had requested non-holiday-themed events, as well as sought more details on the setting and history of the ''Overwatch'' world.&lt;ref name="VG247: Uprising"/&gt;

The event added a new cooperative player-versus-environment mode called "Uprising", played on the King's Row map set in London. In the standard mode, which can be played at one of four difficulty levels, four players select from the characters of Tracer, [[Reinhardt (Overwatch)|Reinhardt]], [[Torbjörn (Overwatch)|Torbjörn]], and Mercy. From there, the players are directed by in-game narration to take several control points while fighting against waves of Null Sector Omnics that try to stop them. Eventually, they must then escort an explosive weapon to a sealed door in order to access the heart of the Null Sector facility and end their threat for good. If a player was downed, any of the other still-surviving players could help them up by interacting with that character for a few moments (or through Mercy's Ultimate ability of Resurrection). If all four players are downed, or the explosive is destroyed before reaching the sealed doors, the round ends as a loss.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising"/&gt;  A separate mode allowed players to complete the same mission without being limited in character selection, but without any of the character-specific dialogue; Blizzard added this based on feedback from Junkenstein's Revenge, so as to provide a less restrictive way to enjoy the game mode.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising"/&gt;

The Uprising mode was considered a much-improved version of a player-versus-environment mode compared to Junkenstein's Revenge from the Halloween event. Cecilia D'Anastasio for ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt the mode was much more dynamic since it required players to move throughout the map rather than stay in one general location, and as the four default characters represent a balanced team, the mode calls for more careful teamwork and strategy. D'Anastasio also felt that with new voice lines to support this mode, it helped to establish the game's lore for players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Uprising Review"/&gt; ''PC Gamer'' argued that the Uprising event demonstrated the potential for a strong team-based story-driven campaign developed within the ''Overwatch'' narrative.&lt;ref name="PC Gamer: Uprising Review"/&gt;

The event had mistakenly ended a few hours earlier than expected on May 1, 2017; Blizzard apologized and extended the event for an additional day into May 2 to allow players to finish acquiring and purchasing the event loot boxes and skins.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Uprising Ended"/&gt;

While the event was just named "Uprising" at its release, Blizzard stated in 2018 that they considered it to be the first "''Overwatch'' Archive" annual event that will be used to explore the history of the characters and narrative.&lt;ref name="polygon archives"/&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The Anniversary event, ran from the end of May 2017, celebrated ''Overwatch''{{'}}s first year since release. Gameplay-wise, it added three new Arena maps used for the smaller-scale Elimination games, and which will remain in rotation after the events' conclusion. The Eliminate mode also received two variants. In one-on-one "Limited Duel" matches, each player is presented with the same selection of three random heroes for play for that round. In three-on-three "Lockout Elimination", the heroes used by the winning team on a round are locked out for the next round.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt;

In addition, over one hundred new cosmetic items are available, including new dancing emotes for each of the characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: Anniversary"/&gt; The dance emotes were found to evoke references to popularized dance moves in other works, such as Mei's dance being similar to the "Hare Hare Yukai" dance used at the end credits for the anime ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Anniversary Dance 2"/&gt;

=== Summer Games 2017 ===
A second Summer Games event was held from August 8 to August 29, 2017.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt; This event brought back the 3-on-3 soccer-like mode, Lucioball, introduced from the first Summer Games, adding additional arenas for the event to be played in, but removing the ability to "boop" other players.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Summer 2017"/&gt; In addition to casual matchmaking for Lucioball, Blizzard also introduced a ranked play system for Lucioball, separate from the game's normal Competitive mode. By participating in this "Copa Lucioball" mode, players earned Competitive Points (CP), the same in-game currency earned playing Competitive matches, and used towards purchasing special weapon skins (such as golden weapons).&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

The previous skins and other cosmetic items offered from the first Summer Games were made available again to obtain in loot crates or purchasable from in-game coins at a lower cost, while additional Summer Games skins were added, purchasable at their normal cost.&lt;ref name="VG247: Summer 2017 Skins"/&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2017 ===
The Halloween Terror 2017 event ran from October 10 to November 2, 2017. The event brought back "Junkenstein's Revenge" from the previous year's event, but added an endless-mode variant that challenges players to defend the door through as many waves as possible. This mode allowed players to have four additional characters to select from, Genji, Torbjorn, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta, in addition to McCree, Soldier: 76, Ana, and Hanzo. Teams lasting the longest were tracked via an online scoreboard.&lt;ref name="VG247: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

New skins and cosmetic items were added to the event, along with the items from the previous Halloween Terror. With the exclusion of the tombstone victory poses introduced in the previous event, all these could be obtained from loot boxes or in-game coin purchase. Blizzard opted to remove the tombstone victory poses from loot box rewards as they believed these no longer fit with the characters' personalities, but still allowed players to purchase them in-game.&lt;ref name="Dot Esports: Halloween 2017"/&gt;

=== Winter Wonderland 2017 ===
The winter-focused "Winter Wonderland 2017" event ran from December 12, 2017 through January 1, 2018. It brought back the previous year's "Winter Wonderland" content, including the "Mei Snowball Offensive" mode and previous cosmetic items, along with new skins and other cosmetics. It also added a new Arcade mode, "Yeti Hunter". In this [[asymmetric gameplay|asymmetric mode]], five players, each playing as [[Mei (Overwatch)|Mei]], attempt to defeat one player controlling [[Winston (Overwatch)|Winston]] (acting as the Yeti) in a boss battle on Nepal's Village stage. Yeti Hunt is the first Overwatch mode to use role selection; players can indicate their preference to play as a Mei or as the Yeti. The Winston player must elude the Mei team, which can freeze him, use ice walls to impede his movement, or catch him in a snare trap (which replaces Mei's usual Ultimate). After collecting four pieces of meat, which spawn randomly in predetermined locations around the map, Winston unleashes his Ultimate ability for a short period which temporarily boosts his health, reduces his jump cooldown, and gives him powerful melee attacks. When a Mei player dies, they will respawn after a short delay and cost their team a life. The match is over once the Mei team either defeats Winston or loses all five of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Winter 2017"/&gt; Kaplan described the Yeti Hunt as a light-hearted mode to be played for a few matches rather than hundreds of hours.&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;

== 2018 events ==
=== Year of the Dog ===
The Chinese New Year event reoccurred from February 8 to March 5, 2018, now reflecting the Year of the [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]].&lt;ref name="PCGamesN: Winter 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/lunar-new-year-seasonal-event-returns-to-overwatch-next-week-w516267 | title = Lunar New Year Seasonal Event Returns to 'Overwatch' Next Week | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = February 1, 2018 | accessdate = February 1, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New cosmetic items relating to the theme were released, in addition to the existing cosmetics from the previous event. A new map, "Ayutthaya", inspired by [[Thailand]] and specifically designed for the Capture the Flag mode, was introduced in this event. Additionally, new Capture the Flag rules for all modes were updated, replacing the potential to have these end as draws by instead playing tie-breaking rounds with the teams' flags starting closer to each other on each subsequent round. The changes also eliminated the short period before players could pick up the flag, now able to pick up the flag instantaneously, but any use of a character's active skills or ultimate abilities that provide mobility or invulnerability would force them to drop the flag, and render the flag unable to be picked up for a few moments. These changes were to make games feel "much more offensive, and much more action-packed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/this-week-s-year-of-the-dog-event-in-overwatch-will-bring-a-new-map-486573.phtml | title = This week's Year of the Dog event in Overwatch will bring a new map | first = Jordan | last = Devore | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a competitive mode for Capture the Flag, following a similar format as the competitive Lucioball mode in the 2017 Summer Games event, was run during the event, rewarding players with Competitive Points and unique items for the end-of-event placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/overwatch-celebrates-lunar-new-year-with-new-map-w516551 | title = 'Overwatch' Celebrates Lunar New Year With New Map and Capture The Flag Mode | first = Blake | last= Hester | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[Glixel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the event, Blizzard featured its inaugural "Puppy Rumble", modeled after the ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', on February 19, 2018, featuring puppies dressed in ''Overwatch'' character outfits in mock events. All of the animals during the event were put up for adoption through the event's co-sponsor [[Petfinder]], as well as promoting animal adoption through other local adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-puppy-rumble-celebrates-the-year-of-the-dog-with-real-dogs/ | title = The Overwatch 'Puppy Rumble' celebrates the Year of the Dog with real dogs | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Overwatch'' Archive: Retribution ===
The ''Overwatch'' Archive event from the previous year returned, and ran from April 10, 2018. It brought back the narrative-driven player-versus-environment mode introduced in Uprising. It also featured a new mode titled "Retribution", which will take place on a new map, Rialto, which entered the game's map rotation as a Payload map outside of the Retribution event, on May 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-map-rialto-is-launching-this-week-f/1100-6458660/ | title = Overwatch's New Map, Rialto, Is Launching This Week For Everyone | first =Eddie | last = Makuch | date = May 1, 2018 | accessdate = May 1, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a four-player co-operative mode, based on the characters Reaper, McCree, Moira, and Genji as they escape from Talon forces; alternatively, this mode also includes an All-Hero mode where players can select any of the available characters. New skins and cosmetic items were available in loot boxes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/29/17176928/overwatch-uprising-event-start-date-2018 | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns in April | first = Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = March 29, 2018 | accessdate = March 29, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon archives"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event | title = Overwatch’s Uprising event returns as Overwatch Archives | first=  Ryan | last = Gilliam | date = April 2, 2018 | accessdate = April 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/4/4/17193808/overwatch-archives-retribution-trailer-reveal-pve | title = Overwatch Archives: Retribution is this year’s Blackwatch PVE brawl | first=  Ryan | last = Gillian | date = April 4, 2018 | accessdate =April 4, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Retribution event was aimed to provide a more replayable experience compared to the prior Uprising event. This included eliminating the waypoint approach they as to reduce elements on the user interface and instead allow players to naturally figure out how to progress in the mission. They also included "specials", unique enemies with special abilities to pose an immediate threat to the players rather than just waves of strong enemies, and included an enemy [[artificial intelligence]] systems to better react to players, including in the All-Hero mode. Much of the ideas of this mode were based on concepts from the ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-retribution-development-heroes-specials-hanzo | title = Left 4 Dead was "a huge inspiration" for Overwatch Retribution | first = Matt | last=  Purslow | date = April 12, 2018 | accessdate = April 12, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary 2018 ===
The second anniversary event ran from May 22 to June 11, 2018. Also with new cosmetic items, the event included a limited time competitive [[deathmatch]] mode with an exclusive map, Petra. In addition to previous Anniversary cosmetic items, all Anniversary loot boxes included cosmetic items from all previous seasonal events, and these are also available to buy with in-game gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/5/14/17348534/overwatch-second-anniversary-event-cosmetics-deathmatch-details | title = Overwatch’s second anniversary event starts May 22 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date =  May 15, 2018 | accessdate = May 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-skins-and-more-out-now-with-annivers/1100-6459128/ | title = New Overwatch Skins And More Out Now With Anniversary Event | first=  Patrick | last=  Faller | date = May 24, 2018 | accessdate = May 24, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Games 2018 ===
The third Summer Games event ran from August 9–30, 2018. The Lucioball event returned with a new stadium map based on [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/8/2/17646222/overwatch-summer-games-2018-august-9th | title= Overwatch’s Summer Games return August 9th | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 2, 2018 | accessdate = August 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halloween Terror 2018 ===
The 2018 iteration of Halloween terror ran from October 10–31, 2018. The Dr. Junkenstein's Revenge mode was updated to include changes made throughout the previous year, such as the changes to Symmetra. The player-versus-environment map remained largely unchanged, with the 2 modes and 4 difficulties each of the last year's event. Brigitte and Tracer were made playable for the game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/1/17922306/overwatch-halloween-terror-2018-event-date | title = Halloween Terror returns to Overwatch on October 9 | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen''' (born 25 February 1957)&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Helsdingen|first = Rene|url = http://www.renevanhelsdingen.com/biography.html|title = Rene van Helsdingen biography|publisher = |date = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch pianist and composer. 

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

[[File:RidersOfJudgment.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">The '''Summit of Ohrid 2013''' was a planned meeting of [[political leader]]s of countries in [[South Eastern Europe]] as well as representatives of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] that would be held on 1 June in the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] city of [[Ohrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitel.com.mk/vesti/makedonija?page=2 Sitel Television - Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; On the 29th of May the [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Gjorge Ivanov]] in a press in the President's residence ''Villa Vodno'' made a statement that he would cancel the international meeting because of the forgive mixing of Balkan nationalism and prejudices.
{{Quote|Macedonia has acted fully in line with the SEECP regulations. Unfortunately, old Balkan prejudices and complexes have surfaced in the run-up to the summit and I will not let Macedonia pay the price. We have been preparing for this summit all year and we have done everything to bring all leaders from the region to the same table.|Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia}}
Before the cancellation of the Summit all of the Balkan countries political leaders were invited. At first all of the countries have accepted the invitation except Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=2&amp;vest=3643 Nova TV - No answer from the Greek President {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Greece, the [[Bulgarian President]] [[Rosen Plevneliev]] made a statement that he also would not attend the Summit, but [[Bulgaria]] would be represented by Marin Raykov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.mk/cluster/cf789f3d37/otkaza-i-bugarskiot-pretsedatel-na-ohridskiot-samit.html Time.MK - Greek and Bulgarian President won't come to Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The last one to reject the invitation was the [[President of Albania]] [[Bujar Nishani]] who stated that he did so because leaders from the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] weren't attending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://24vesti.mk/albanskiot-pretsedatel-nishani-nema-da-uchestvuva-na-samitot-vo-ohrid 24 Vesti - Albanian President won't be a part of the Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] wasn't invited under the objection of [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and [[Romania]] who don't recognise the disputed country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=86390 B92 News - Serbia, two more countries block Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Albania]] and [[Croatia]] said that they would not attend without Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php B92 News - Macedonia "protects dignity and integrity," cancels summit]&lt;/ref&gt; EU Delegation head ''Vincent Degert'' said that the [[South-East European Cooperation Process]] is not covered in the Brussels agreement between Belgrade and Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=86403 B92 News - EU would like Kosovo to take part in Ohrid Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was supposed to be the 16th Meeting of Presidents of Central European States after the [[Ohrid Summit 2008]]. Among those who accepted the invitation to the meeting were: [[President of Croatia]] [[Ivo Josipović]], [[President of Moldova]] [[Nicolae Timofti]], [[President of Montenegro]] [[Filip Vujanović]], [[President of Romania]] [[Traian Băsescu]], [[President of Serbia]] [[Tomislav Nikolić]], [[President of Slovenia]] [[Borut Pahor]], [[President of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[Nebojša Radmanović]], the [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey]] [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]], and also the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] [[Vuk Jeremić]] and the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] [[Štefan Füle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.mk/cluster/22512207f7/file-ke-dojde-na-ohridskiot-samit-papuljas-seuste-ne-odgovara.html Time.MK - Ohrid Summit 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ITV announced that it would transmit a live adaptation of the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as part of its holiday programming lineup, in what would be the first time that such a programme had been attempted in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV To Mount ‘The Sound Of Music Live!’ UK Christmas Special|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/itv-sound-of-music-live-christmas-special-kara-tointon-1201590814/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live'' was part of ITV's continuing efforts to broadcast more live "[[Event television|event]]" programs, which are designed to attract critical masses of viewers by encouraging them to watch via the original broadcast, rather than via [[video on demand|catch-up]] services and [[digital video recorder]]s. The desire for increased ITV viewership came especially in the wake of declining ratings for its reality music competition ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', whose [[The X Factor (UK series 12)|series 12]] finale had the second-smallest viewership in the programme's history. ITV had similarly broadcast live episodes of its series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in [[Coronation Street Live (2000 episode)|2000]] and [[Coronation Street Live (2010 episode)|2010]] in honour of its 40th and 50th anniversary respectively, and in 2015 for ITV's 60th anniversary.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"/&gt;

This was not the first time that ''The Sound of Music'' had been adapted in such a manner. In 2013, U.S. network [[NBC]] broadcast its own [[The Sound of Music Live!|live television adaptation of ''The Sound of Music'']] starring [[country music|country]] singer [[Carrie Underwood]]; similarly to ITV's version, it was an adaptation of the original musical, and not based on the [[The Sound of Music|film version]]. Although it received mixed reviews, it was seen by over 18 million viewers. As follow-ups, NBC produced similar adaptations of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]'' in 2014 and 2015 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-wiz-live-nbc-s-latest-live-musical-broadcast-from-long-island-1.11164689|title=‘The Wiz Live!’: NBC’s latest live musical broadcast from Long Island|last1=Crook|first1=John|date=26 November 2015|website=newsday.com |publisher=Newsday|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-ratings-nbc/ |title=Ratings: NBC's Sound of Music Live!

==Cast==
[[Kara Tointon]] played Maria, and [[Julian Ovenden]] played Captain Georg von Trapp. The supporting cast included veterans of British television and theatre, including [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Max Detweiler, [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] as Baroness Elsa Schraeder, [[Maria Friedman]] as Mother Abess, [[Evelyn Hoskins]] as Liesl von Trapp, Jon Tarcy as Rolf Gruber, [[Mel Giedroyc]] as the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and [[Paul Copley]] as the butler, Franz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live!|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dwnsbw/the-sound-of-music-live|website=Radio Times|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Sound of Music Live'' received mixed reviews. Mark Shenton of ''[[The Stage]]'' said it was a failed experiment, with "uninspired and sometimes insipid" choreography and direction, although he praised the cast's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenton|first1=Mark|title=The Sound of Music Live review – ‘bold experiment doesn’t pay off’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-sound-of-music-live-review-bold-experiment-doesnt-pay-off/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Allfree of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said it lacked both the intimacy of live theatre and the scope of the big screen, but nevertheless judged it "more a success than it was a failure," saying that former ''[[EastEnders]]'' star Tointon "brought a refreshing earthiness and grit to Maria that made the passionate, unconventional novice feel thoroughly modern and accessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live, review: 'much to enjoy'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/12056862/the-sound-of-music-review-kara-tointon-live-itv.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said that Tointon was "showered with praise" for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kara Tointon shocks fans with incredible vocals as she plays Maria in The Sound Of Music live|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kara-tointon-shocks-fans-incredible-7048037|website=The Mirror|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was watched by over 3.82 million viewers according to overnight ratings figures, being beaten by the [[The Apprentice (UK series eleven)|series eleven]] finale of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' (5.31 million) and its lead-in, the [[2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] presentation (5.78 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-apprentice/news/a777848/uk-tv-ratings-the-apprentice-final-loses-800000-from-last-year-sports-personality-is-top-with-57m/ |title=UK TV ratings: The Apprentice final is lowest in 10 years, Sports Personality is top with 5.7m |author=Tom Eames |work=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV's The Sound of Music Live draws 4m viewers|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/itvs-the-sound-of-music-live-draws-4m-viewers/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thevar Jayanthi in Madurai, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Garlanding Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue in [[Madurai]] during the 2007 Thevar Jayanthi centenary]]'''''Thevar Jayanthi''''', celebrated on 30 October, is an annual commemoration of the birthday of [[U. Muthuramalingam Thevar|Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar]]. It is celebrated in a grand way by the [[Thevar]] community in the southern districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/28tn1.htm |title=Security beefed up in Madurai for Thevar Jayanthi |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an official public holiday, many schools and businesses in the area remain closed on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103105270300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/31/stories/2005103116560300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions pass off peacefully |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/31/stories/2007103159910300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thevar's legacy==
Whilst having been active in politics, it is mainly the spiritual discourse of Thevar that explains his following after his death. Also, the fact that his date of birth and death lie some close to each other has been interpreted as a sign of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Thevar Samadhi==
One of the main events on Thevar Jayanthi takes place at the ''samadhi'' (burial place) of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, located at some 50 miles distance from [[Madurai]]. Pilgrims gather to take part in the ceremonies at the ''samadhi'' on 30 October. In later years the ceremony at the ''samadhi'' has begun to attract prominent politicians.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Robinson, Rowena. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&amp;pg=PA167 Sociology of Religion in India]''. New Delhi [u.a.]: SAGE, 2004. pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy==
The [[All India Forward Bloc]], the [[political party]] to which Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar belonged, has demanded that Thevar Jayanthi be declared a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710090655&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071009 |title=Mid term polls linked to Cong stand on US nuke pact: AIFB|publisher=webindia123.com |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is not entirely uncontroversial. The [[CPI(ML) Liberation]] has charged that the Tamil Nadu government should stop sponsoring Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, claiming that the event is utilised by [[caste]]ist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2009/jan_09/reports.html |title=Kerala : Land Reforms Undone |publisher=[[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation]]|date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 centenary celebrations==
On 30 October 2007, the birth centenary of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar was celebrated. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] took part in the celebrations in [[Pasumpon]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/10/30/karunanidhi-jaya-pay-floral-tributes-to-muthuramalinga-thevar-1193737346.html |title=Karunanidhi, Jaya pay floral tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in two decades that Karunanidhi participated in Thevar Jayanthi.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; At the celebrations, Karunanidhi suggested that [[Madurai Airport]] be renamed after Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. These moves were seen as an attempt by Karunanidhi's [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party to challenge the supremacy of the rival [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) over the Thevar community. The AIADMK leader [[J. Jayalalitha]] criticised Karunanidhi's participation in the Thevar Jayanthi centenary programme, stating that he did not believe in Thevar's ideas. Moreover, she claimed that her previous government had allocated 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]] for the Thevar Jayanthi centenary, but that Karunanidhi's government had spent only five million rupees.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianchristians.in/news/content/view/1732/48/ |title=New Icon, Old Wounds |publisher=All India Christian Council|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] was originally planned to be organised in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] at the [[Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex]] on 26 September 2009.&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esckaz.com/edc/|title=European Broadcasting Union has finally officially confirmed the date of EDC 2009|date=2009-04-02|publisher=''ESCKaz''|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[İctimai Televiziya və Radio Yayımları Şirkəti|İctimai Television]] was planning to increase the number of participating countries as well as inviting a world-famous star to host the contest, listing [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Shakira]] as candidates.&lt;ref name="hosts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=102659|title=We are negotiating with Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue and Shakira to host the Eurovision Dance 2009 in Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional extravaganza [[open-air concert]] was planned to be held, bringing together ex-participants of the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]], [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Junior Eurovision]] and [[Eurovision Dance Contest|Eurovision Dance]] Contests on one stage.&lt;ref name="date" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisiondance.tv/page/news?id=1905|title=Baku: More details announced at press conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
On the date of cancellation, two countries had finished selection of the participating couples for the contest:

*{{esc|Azerbaijan|Dance}} – host country
*{{esc|Belarus|Dance}} – winners of 3-month long preselection show ''Star Dances'' were [[Yulia Raskina]] and [[Denis Moryasin]]. Producer of the show confirmed that they would take part in Eurovision Dance Contest 2010 if it is organised.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;
*{{esc|Poland|Dance}} – [[Natasza Urbańska]] and Jan Kliment.
*{{esc|Portugal|Dance}} – internal selection was expected to take place with the couple being selected from the RTP series ''Dança Comigo''.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurofire.blog.de/2009/04/15/news-splitter-5950321/|title=News Splitter (208)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{esc|Russia|Dance}} – was set to be represented by professional couple [[Sergey Konovaltsev]] and [[Olga Konovaltseva]], named as participants of the show as early as in May 2008 and confirmed in 2009 edition of Russian version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

==Cancellation==
However, on 28 May 2009, [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) had announced that the contest was postponed at least until Autumn 2010 as "the number of broadcasters that signed up for participation had not reach the desired level". According to a preliminary calculations, at least five countries that were taking part in [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008]], namely {{esccnty|Austria|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Finland|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Lithuania|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Netherlands|Dance}} and {{esccnty|Sweden|Dance}} had announced withdrawal from the contest, with only {{esccnty|Belarus|Dance}} confirming its participation as a début country.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

According to contest coordinator on behalf of EBU Tal Barnea "concrete plans for a 2010 autumn event were being developed, with considerable changes to introduce a new programme proposal". These plans were expected to be unveiled in the autumn of 2009. EBU also praised "the commendable work on the next Eurovision Dance Contest already completed by our partners Ictimai Television and the Azerbaijani officials" stating that 2010 edition of the contest was planned to take place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] as well. 

In January 2010, EBU Eurovision coordinator, [[Svante Stockselius]], announced that contest has been postponed again, and is now unlikely to happen at all, at least within the next couple of years. He explained this decision was the fact that the popularity of televised dance shows had calmed down recently.&lt;ref name="date1"/&gt;

[[File:Analemma fishburn.tif|right|thumb|An [[analemma]] illustrates the changing [[position of the Sun]] over the course of a year, as viewed from a fixed [[standard time|time of day]].]]

A '''year''' is the [[orbital period]] of the [[Earth]] moving in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]]. The current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

In [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.

A [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.

In astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.) Reprinted from: {{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf |title=The IAU Style Manual |year=1989 |journal=IAU Transactions |volume=XXB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''year'' is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [[seasonal year]], the [[fiscal year]], the [[academic year]], etc. Similarly, ''year'' can mean the orbital period of any [[planet]]; for example, a [[Martian year]] and a [[Venus|Venusian year]] are examples of the time  a planet takes to    transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "year", entry 2.b.: "''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
English ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''ġēar'' ({{IPA|/jɛar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''ġēr'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*jǣran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#ē₁ and ē₂|ē₁]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ran&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
Cognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''jār'', [[Old Norse]] ''ár'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:𐌾𐌴𐍂|jer]]'',&lt;!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--&gt; from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh₁-|*yeh₁r-om]]}}'' "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''yārǝ'' "year", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὥρα}} (hṓra) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[[hour]]"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jarŭ'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' "of this year". &lt;!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁ey-]] "go", needs reference to deal with the "laryingealistic" problems--&gt;

Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''annī'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''annō'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h₂et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''aþn'' "year" (only the dative plural ''aþnam'' is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh₁r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh₁-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh₁-ro-'' and ''*h₂et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", ''*h₁ey-'' and ''*h₂et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''éti'' "goes", ''atasi'' "thou goest, wanderest").
A number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means "each year", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", {{lang|grc|ἔτος}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' "old", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' "year", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' "year" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' "bull calf",  English ''wether'' "ram" (Old English ''weðer'', Gothic ''wiþrus'' "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:年|年]] "year", originally [[:wikt:秂|秂]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/godъ|godŭ]]'' "time period; year" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lěto|lěto]]'' "summer; year".

In the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.

== Intercalation ==
No astronomical year has an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.

=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name "[[Leap Day]]" is applied to the added day.

The [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, 
has 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;).
In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Miriam Nancy. (1924). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924PA.....32..407S "The New Calendar of the Eastern Churches], ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 32, p.407. Courtesy NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gregorian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the [[northward equinox]] to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [[tropical year|northward equinox year]], or [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziggelaar, A. (1983). [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The Papal Bull of 1582 Promulgating a Reform of the Calendar"]. In Coyne, Hoskin, Pedersen (eds), ''Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to Commemorate its 400th Anniversary''. Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Specolo Vaticano, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years,   the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is {{gaps|365.242|5}} days; with a relative error below one [[Parts per million|ppm]] (8·10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;)  relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ({{gaps|365.242|19}} days) and even closer to the current ''March equinox year'' of {{gaps|365.242|374}} days that it aims to match.   It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.

===Other calendars===
{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}
Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.
Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).

A modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

==Year numbering==
A [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.

The worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]] era (but the label [[Common Era]] is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P. K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly state Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does state on page 585 the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes; the Gregorian calendar is used with the Anno Domini era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] "in the year of the Lord"), or alternatively CE for "[[Common Era]]. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].
Year numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no "year zero".
In the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], −1 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.

==Pragmatic divisions==
Financial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.

=== Fiscal year ===
A [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.

=== Academic year ===
An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].

Some schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

== Astronomical years == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] --&gt;

=== Julian year ===
{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}
The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit "year" (symbol "a" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].

In the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.

:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]

The [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.

=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===
{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}

Each of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.

The [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service. (2010).[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [[ecliptic longitude]] of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). Calendars. In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann (Eds.), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.). Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books. p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#longitude-ecliptic longitude, ecliptic]" and "[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#dynamical-equinox dynamical equinox]". (2018). In "Glossary", ''The Astronomical Almanac Online''. United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt; the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is {{val|365.259636}} days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Draconic year ===
The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is
:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Full moon cycle ===
The [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:
:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Lunar year ===
The [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].
A Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.

=== Vague year ===
The vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

=== Heliacal year ===
A heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Sothic year ===
The [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

=== Gaussian year ===
The [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:
:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).

=== Besselian year === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] --&gt;
The [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):&lt;ref&gt;

The TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].&lt;!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' --&gt;

=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.
* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].

An average Gregorian year is 365.2425 [[day]]s (52.1775 [[week]]s, {{val|8765.82}} [[hour]]s, {{val|525949.2}} [[minute]]s or {{val|31556952}} [[second]]s).  For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ({{val|8760}} hours, {{val|525600}} minutes or {{val|31536000}} seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ({{val|8784}} hours, {{val|527040}} minutes or {{val|31622400}} seconds).  The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has {{val|146097}} days and hence exactly {{val|20871}} weeks.

== "Greater" astronomical years ==

=== Equinoctial cycle ===
The Great Year, or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.

=== Galactic year ===
The [[Galactic year]] is the time it takes Earth's [[solar system]] to revolve once around the [[galactic center]]. It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years.&lt;ref&gt;

== Seasonal year ==
{{Further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [[month]] from year to year.

== Symbols ==
In the [[ISO 80000-3|International System of Quantities]] the symbol for the year as a [[unit of time]] is ''[[a (year)|a]]'', taken from the Latin word ''annus''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;

In English, the abbreviations "y" or "yr" are more commonly used in non-scientific literature, but also specifically in [[geology]] and [[paleontology]], where "[[kyr]], [[myr]], [[byr]]" (thousands, millions, and billions of years, respectively) and similar abbreviations are used to denote intervals of time remote from the present.&lt;ref name="How" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AGUStyle"&gt;

where:
:''a'', without a qualifier = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;;
:and, ''ar'' for ''[[Hectare#Are|are]]'', is a unit of area.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] have jointly recommended defining the annus, with symbol ''a'', as the length of the tropical year in the year 2000:
:''a'' = {{val|31556925.445}} seconds (approximately {{val|365.24219265}} [[ephemeris day]]s)

This differs from the above definition of 365.25 days by about 20 [[parts per million]]. The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year "bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth’s orbital movement", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norman E.

The notation has proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use ''a'' specifically for ''years ago'', and ''y'' or ''yr'' for a one-year time period.&lt;ref name="Biever-war"/&gt;

==== SI prefix multipliers ====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous]], from [[Template:Geologic time scale]] and from [[Theropoda]]. --&gt;
For the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as ''kilannus'', ''megannus'', etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.
* {{Anchor|Kiloannus|Kiloannum}} '''''ka''''' (for kiloannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[thousand]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E3 yr, also known as a [[millennium]] in [[anthropology]] and calendar uses. The prefix multiplier "ka" is typically used in geology, paleontology, and [[archaeology]] for the [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[period (geology)|periods]], where a non−[[radiocarbon dating]] technique: e.g. [[ice core]] dating, [[dendrochronology]], [[uranium-thorium dating]], or [[varve]] analysis; is used as the primary dating method for age determination. If age is primarily determined by [[radiocarbon dating]], then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [[Before Present]].
* {{Anchor|Megaannus|Megaannum}} '''''Ma''''' (for megaannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[million]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E6 yr. The suffix "Ma" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[celestial mechanics]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term "ago" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that "ago" is implied; the alternative unit "mya" does include "ago" explicitly. It also written as "million years" (ago) in works for general public use. In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author.
* {{Anchor|Gigaannus|Gigaannum}} '''''Ga''''' (for gigaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years. "Ga" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and geology to signify extremely long time periods in the past. For example, [[history of the earth|the formation of the Earth]] occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago.
* {{Anchor|Teraannus|Teraannum}} '''''Ta''''' (for teraannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] years. "Ta" is an extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the [[age of the universe]]. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small [[red dwarf]].
* {{Anchor|Petaannus|Petaannum}} '''''Pa''''' (for petaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[10^15|quadrillion]] years. The half-life of the nuclide [[cadmium|cadmium-113]] is about 8 Pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = P.

===Abbreviations yr and ya===
{{anchor|years ago}}{{anchor|kya}}{{anchor|Mya}}
{{further|Before Present}}

In [[astronomy]], geology, and paleontology, the abbreviation ''yr'' for ''years'' and ''ya'' for '''''years ago''''' are sometimes used, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASC"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature|url=http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/NACSN/Code2/code2.html#Article13
 |title=North American Stratigraphic Code (Article 13 (c))
 |quote=(c) Convention and abbreviations. – The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; years), Mega-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years), and Giga-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English "[[:wikt:year|year]]", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "22,000 years ago" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] ("BP") date.

These abbreviations include:

Use of ''mya'' and ''bya'' is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being ''Ma'' and ''Ga'' for dates [[Before Present]], but "m.y." for the duration of epochs.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strat" /&gt; This ''ad hoc'' distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Society of America|title=Time Units|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|accessdate=February 17, 2010| archivedate=June 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616100504/http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that on graphs, using ''ya'' units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the ''ya'' units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Where programs require subsidy, ZeeWee organizers may use a "green fee" to help move the event toward sustainability by paying for [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]], buying recycled products, or more recently purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norkarecreation.com/hcrewards.htm |title=Bellingham/Whatcom County Washington |publisher=NorKarecreation.com |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
When the bid was submitted for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], [[LOCOG]], The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, pledged not just to host the biggest sporting event in the world but also to stage the first truly sustainable Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160540 |title=London 2012 Olympics team publishes first green report - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this was an ambitious target to send zero waste from Games-time venues directly to landfill &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/london-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications &amp;#124; Downloads &amp;#124; Olympic.org |publisher=London2012.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – something that no Games has attempted before. 
In February 2012 an initiative was launched to share the lessons learnt from delivering a zero waste games with the wider waste and events community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerowasteevents.org/front/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327035411/http://zerowasteevents.org/front/ |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
