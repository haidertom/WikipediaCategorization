      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9238">'''1313 Dead End Drive''' is a murder-themed board game from [[Parker Brothers]].&lt;ref name="WallaceHowisonBradley2009"/&gt; Released in 2002, it was the sequel to 1993 game ''[[13 Dead End Drive]]''.

The story behind the game revolves around the death of Aunt Agatha, a wealthy old woman and heiress to a "kitty-litter empire." Sixteen of her closest companions have gathered at her estate for the reading of her will, and to collect their inheritance, they must escape Aunt Agatha's trap-filled mansion before midnight.

==Gameplay==
At the start of gameplay, players are passed out "Heir Cards" which correspond to the pawns that are placed on the board. There are a total of sixteen characters, so it is almost always the case that players control more than one character. Players are required to keep the roles of their Character Cards secret from their opponents. Additionally there are thirty-two "Playing Cards," which allow players to do special things during their turn such as spring traps or instantly move pawns to other rooms. There is also one "Clock Strikes Midnight" card that is placed at the bottom of the Playing Cards, and if this card is drawn by any player, the game ends.

During each turn, players roll two dice and move two pawns which correspond to each dice roll. Players are allowed to move any pawn on the board, regardless if they hold its corresponding Heir Card or not, so that they can move it closer to or further away from a trap space or the door. A pawn can be moved onto a Trap space by exact roll only, and when a pawn is moved onto a Trap space, the player must draw a card from the Playing Cards stack. To spring a trap, a player must have a corresponding trap card in their possession. Springing traps is not mandatory, however. There are also Secret Passage spaces that players can use to quickly travel around the mansion.

Also during the game, players must pay attention to Aunt Agatha's will, which changes with the death of each character. The will contains the portrait of each character and is organized in a chain-like fashion. Every character begins with a single money bag token, except for Spritzy, who begins with four, and Sedgewick, who begins with two. When a character is "knocked off", their money tokens go to the next character in line of the will. When the last surviving character of the will is knocked off, their money tokens go to the "Pet Pals Retirement Home", and no one receives the money. If a character escapes the mansion, their money bag tokens are removed from the will and their space on the will is skipped over if a character preceding them on the will is knocked off.

===Ways to Win===
The winner of the game is determined by the amount of money bag tokens each player has at the end of the game. Whoever has the most money bag tokens when every player is out of the mansion (either by death or by escape) is the winner of the game. If the bottom of the Playing Cards stack is reached and the "Clock Strikes Midnight" card is drawn, gameplay ends instantly and players must count the moneybags currently in their possession to determine the winner.

===Traps===
''1313 Dead End Drive'' has five different booby traps that can be sprung throughout the mansion.

*'''The Stair Trap''' is located in the Art Room, and a lever can be pushed down on the top step to make the pawn on the trap fall off the stairway.
*'''The Fireplace Trap''' is in the Grand Room, and an urn can be rotated to move the pawn on the trap around to the back of the fireplace.
*'''The Boar's Head Trap''' is in the Trophy Room, and a lever can be lifted from the back of the wall to release the Boar's Head to drop it on the pawn under it.
*'''The Suit of Armor Trap''' is in the Parlor Room, a lever can be pushed on the statue to make the suit of armor topple over onto the pawn.
*'''The Safe Trap''' is in the Vault Room, and a lever can be pushed to make a piggybank hidden inside the safe shoot down the chute and strike the pawn.

Any player can move any pawn onto a Trap Space, but it must be by exact roll. To spring the trap to knock off the pawn, a player must use a corresponding Trap Card, which can be drawn from the Playing Cards stack. When a trap is sprung on a character, their pawn and Heir Card are placed on the table to signify that they are no longer in play. Additionally, any money bags that are on their space in the will or moved to the next heir in line.

===Characters===
'''Aunt Agatha''': A "filthy-rich heiress to a kitty-litter empire" whose estate the heirs are competing for.

'''The Heirs''' (In the order that they appear on the will):
*'''Spritzy''': Agatha's hair stylist; cut her hair for fifteen years
*'''Sedgwick''': Agatha's nephew; a mad scientist who needs Agatha's money to continue his research in curing bald eagles
*'''Dusty''': Agatha's maid
*'''Parker''': Agatha's chauffeur; Agatha annoyed her with backseat driving tips
*'''Prudence''': Agatha's accountant; a former ambulance chaser
*'''Lulu''': Agatha's sister; gossiped with Agatha for an occasional "loan" from her
*'''Sassy''': An aspiring rock star; used Agatha's money to try to skyrocket her career
*'''Madame Astra''': Agatha's fortune teller
*'''Pierre''': Agatha's cook
*'''Smothers''': Agatha's butler; served Agatha for thirty years
*'''Charity''': Agatha's personal physician
*'''Clay''': Resident tennis professional
*'''Perkins''': Hunter; kept Agatha's Wild Game Preserve
*'''Pugsley''': Agatha's dog
*'''Beauregard III''': Agatha's lover
*'''Poopsie''': Agatha's cat

===Playing Cards===
There are five different kinds of Playing Cards:
*'''Room card''': This card allows a player to move any pawn from any space and move it to any unoccupied space in the room shown on the card, including a Trap space.
*'''Take a New Heir card''': This card allows a player to take one Heir card from any opponent's hand. The player can choose any opponent to take an Heir card from, and they pick one at random.
*'''Run for it! card''': This card allows a player to move any pawn of their choice the number rolled on the die. These cards can help players move pawns away or off of Trap spaces, help a pawn escape, or even prevent a pawn from escaping.
*'''Trap card''': This card allows players to spring one of the two traps that are displayed on the card.
*'''Wild Trap card''': This card allows a player to spring any trap.

Players can play as many Trap cards as they wish on a single turn; additionally or instead, they can play one of any other card. Playing Cards must be played after a player rolls their two dice.

===Special Spaces and Rules===
*'''Rolling Doubles''': If a player rolls doubles, they have a choice of moving one pawn the sum of their die roll, or continuing play as normal, you do not get to roll again.
*'''Secret Passages''': There are several secret passage spaces located across the mansion. Going through a secret passage counts as one space move, and players are not limited to which secret passage they move to.
*'''Bluffing''': Bluffing is allowed and encouraged in '''1313 Dead End Drive'''. You can move your opponents' pawns towards the Front Door or even move your own pawns onto Trap spaces in order to fool your opponents. Since Playing Cards can be kept secret from opponents and since Trap cards do not have to be played when they are drawn, this allows for more variety and safer bluffing.
*'''The "Retrap" move''': It is possible for a player to move a pawn off of a Trap space and back onto it in a single turn in order to draw a Playing Card.

==13 Dead End Drive==
[[13 Dead End Drive]] is the predecessor to ''1313 Dead End Drive''. Many of the aspects of the first game were passed on to the second, but there are several alterations: in 13 Dead End Drive, Aunt Agatha's Will is replaced by a "Portrait", which hangs over the fireplace and displays the portrait of any of the twelve (instead of sixteen) heirs. If an heir escapes while they are displayed in the portrait, they win the game. Instead of the "Clock Strikes Midnight" card, there are thirteen "Detective Cards" scattered throughout the Trap card pile. When a Detective card is drawn, a Detective pawn, which is waiting outside of the mansion, moves one space closer to the mansion. The game can end instantly if the thirteenth Detective card is drawn and the Detective pawn reaches the front door. Additionally, the Boar's Head trap is replaced by a Chandelier, and the Safe trap is replaced by a Bookshelf. Also, one of the characters from the original game, '''Hickory''', the gardener, does not appear in this one.

{{2018 Commonwealth Games}}
The opening ceremony for the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] took place on the evening of Wednesday 4 April in the [[Carrara Stadium]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.royal.uk/opening-gold-coast-2018-commonwealth-games?page=4|title=Opening of The Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games|last=Jenny.minard|date=2017-07-27|work=The Royal Family|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was '''''Hello Earth''''' and directed by [[David Zolkwer]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

The ceremony began at 20:00 [[AEST]] and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous culture]], Gold Coast's [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]], wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]]''',''' [[Queensland Youth Orchestras|Queensland Youth Orchestra]] and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as [[Christine Anu]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Katie Noonan]] and [[Ricki-Lee Coulter|Ricki-Lee Coutler]] performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised.       

== Preparations ==
Three Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies [[Ric Birch]], head of Spectak, [[David Atkins]], head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. [[Ric Birch]], who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Brisbane]], the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]] and the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/27/olympics-creative-director-unhappy-over-2018-commonwealth-games-snub|title=Olympics creative director unhappy over 2018 Commonwealth Games snub|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2015-12-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW  is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]] and the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-27/us-company-to-produce--gold-coast-commonwealth-games-ceremonies/7055462|title=US company to produce Gold Coast Commonwealth Games ceremonies|date=2015-12-27|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was [[David Zolkwer]], Head of [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] Public Events. David previously led the teams for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]] and [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jackmorton.com/people/david-zolkwer/|title=David Zolkwer {{!}} Jack Morton|work=Jack Morton|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian singer [[Katie Noonan]], winner of five [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA music awards]] and former lead singer of [[Brisbane]] based band [[George (band)|George]], was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said "I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/katie-noonan-to-direct-music-in-commonwealth-games-ceremonies-20171122-p4yx5r.html|title=Katie Noonan to direct music in Commonwealth Games ceremonies|last=Wenzel|first=Murray|date=2017-11-22|website=Brisbane Times|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has served as the Artistic Director of the [[Queensland Music Festival]] since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qmf.org.au/aboutus/artistic-director/|title=Artistic Director - Queensland Music Festival|work=Queensland Music Festival|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==

=== Countdown ===
The opening ceremony started with a countdown from 65000 years quickly to 10-1 seconds. When the countdown is finished, a very large firework exploded in the middle of the ground of the Carrara Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/live-updates-of-commonwealth-games-2018-opening-ceremony/10987654321-and-the-ceremony-begins-/articleshow/63611318.cms|title=10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 and the ceremony begins... - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Hello Earth ===
Australian Actor [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] spoke about the history of Earth along with holding an illuminated globe.
{{Cquote|Home. That’s where we live. From here, you can’t see any borders. No barriers built to divide us, no people on different sides. All that we are, and have been, and can be, all that we value, all that we love, all our memories and stories, our hopes and our dreams, the best, and the worst, of us – is here, on that tiny grain of rock. From here there’s no sound of our quarrels, no voices in conflict, no people at war. From here it seems, we’re all the same, not drifting apart, but all connected. No sign of ‘Other’ – only Sister and Brother. No ‘You’, or ‘Me’ – just ‘We’.

A group of girls stood at the image projection of land and raised their right hands. The large mass of land immediately separated into seven continents.

[[File:Horse race, Churchill Downs 2008-04-18.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse racing is a very popular sporting event involving animals.]]

'''Animals in sport''' are a specific form of working animals.  Many animals, at least in more commercial sports, are highly trained.  Two of the most common animals in sport are horses and dogs.

==Types of animal sporting events==
There are many types of animal sporting events, with varying levels of participation from humans. Some are solely between the animals while others use the animals in a lesser role.  Most sports involve training, while some can also involve selective breeding.

There are some large-scale events that include animals in a variety of sports.  A rodeo can comprise many different sports, ranging from bull riding to pole bending. Some of the most well known types of animal racing may be, Horse racing, Dog racing (Greyhound racing), Pigeon racing, Camel racing, and (even Mule racing which mainly takes place in some parts of California etc,) as well as many more.
[[File:JASDogRace.JPG|thumb|Greyhounds preparing for a race.]]

===Racing===

Racing is the most popular form of animal-related sport, particularly horse racing.  Some racing events directly involve humans as riders while others see the animals race alone.  In some sports the rider is not directly riding the animal, instead being pulled along.  Examples of this include harness racing, dogsled racing and popular ancient Greece and Roman Empire sport of chariot racing.

[[Greyhound racing]], a popular form of animal racing, dates back to the 1800s in the United States, after the dogs were brought over from Europe to help control the [[hare]] population. While track racing is the most common, there are other forms of racing.  [[Pigeon racing]], for example, sees [[homing pigeons]] finding their way home from a set distance away. [[Kambala]], he-buffalo racing in coastal Karnataka, India is a rural spectator racing conducted every year during winter in about 50 towns/villages.
Racing events are a common way to [[gambling|gamble]], with billions spent worldwide every year.  This is one reason that some countries or states have made such sports illegal.

===One-on-one and team events===
There are some non-racing competitive events involving animals.  [[Polo]] is an example, with competitors hitting a [[ball]] with [[mallet]]s while on horseback.  [[Elephant polo]] dates back to the early 20th century when members of the British aristocracy in [[Nepal]] began playing the sport.

In the 14th to 16th centuries [[jousting]] was a popular one-on-one tournament event involving knights on horseback.

===Fighting===
[[File:Bull attacks matador.jpg|thumb|Bullfighting is legal in some countries.]]
In most counties the act of two or more animals fighting each other, such as [[cockfighting]], and [[dog fighting]], is seen as cruel and is therefore illegal.  Some legal animal fights take place around the world, including [[cow fighting]] and [[camel wrestling]].  There are also some legal forms of sport where humans fight animals, such as [[bullfighting]] which has a long history in Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tradition.  Not all animals are large, however, with [[cricket fighting]] being a popular (though illegal to gamble on) sport in [[Macau]] and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theregister.co.uk/2004/08/16/cricket_fighting_ring/ HK feds bust illegal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other [[blood sport]]s in history that were intended as entertainment, many of which involved [[bait (dogs)|baiting by dogs]].  Many different types of animal have been placed into a pit, sometimes tied to a post, and set upon by dogs.  This ranges from [[rat-baiting]] and [[badger-baiting]] to [[bear-baiting]] and [[lion-baiting]].  There are even some tales of [[human-baiting]].

Animals that take part in animal fights are usually specifically bred for strength and stamina.

===Hunting===
[[File:BedaleHunt2005.jpg|thumb|Fox hunting has been a recent controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom.]]
{{main|Hunting}}
Hunting began as a crucial component of [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, being an important source of food.  The domestication of animals and the development of [[agriculture]] lessened the need for hunts, with food being more readily available. Hunting became a sport for those of the high [[social class]]es.  In most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper-class (aristocracy and higher clergy) obtained as privilege the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory.

Dangerous hunting, as for lions or wild boars, usually on horseback (or from a [[chariot]], as in [[History of ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) also had function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports: an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace.  In [[ancient Rome]] the "[[Venatio]]" was a form of entertainment that pitted humans against animals in an amphitheater.

In modern times, hunting is usually legal as long as the hunter has a license, though there are some unregulated forms in some countries.  Animals can be on either side of a hunt, assisting the hunters or being hunted themselves.

[[Fox hunting]] has been a controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom, regarding its necessity and the cruelty involved (See [[Fox hunting legislation]]).

====Fishing====
[[Fishing]] is somewhat different from other sports and is most commonly a pastime or hobby.  However, it can also be [[Sport fishing|a competitive sport]].

====Pigeon shooting====
[[Pigeon shooting]] was one of the [[Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics|shooting events]] of the [[1900 Summer Olympics]]. Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters.

===Shows of training or breeding===
[[File:JackRussellJump wb.jpg|thumb|A [[Jack Russell Terrier]] competing in a dog agility event.]]
Shows are intended to highlight the excellence of training or [[Selective breeding|breeding]] of the animals involved.  There is a variety of horse riding sports in this category, including [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], both of which are featured at the [[Olympic Games]]. At lower levels, [[horse show]]s offer a wide variety of competition both [[Equestrianism|riding and driving]] as well as [[halter (horse show)|In-hand]] classes that evaluate [[equine conformation]].

Dogs, being easily [[domesticated animal|domesticated]], are one of the most popular animals to have in shows. [[Cattle]] and [[sheepdog trial]]s are popular in many countries and are used to show how well a dog can [[muster (livestock)|gather]] livestock. Other [[dog sports]] of this category include [[dog agility]] events, whereby the dogs must tackle [[obstacle course]]s, and [[obedience trial]]s, where they must execute a predefined set of tasks.

[[Crufts]], a British [[conformation show]] for dogs, has grown since it started in 1886.  While dogs are the most common show animal, [[cat show]]s are also common.  Both of these animals have a wide variety of breeds and compete in categories, comparing each individual to the breed "ideal."

Some unusual animals also take part in shows, such as the competitors in [[rabbit show jumping]] and [[common chaffinch]]es in [[vinkenzetting]].

==Popular culture==
Films and television series about animals in sport can be realistic or fictional, involving animals in an activity that they cannot really perform.  ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' is a fairly accurate portrayal of the famous American [[Seabiscuit|horse of the same name]], while ''[[MVP: Most Valuable Primate]]'', a film about a [[hockey]]-playing [[chimpanzee]], is unrealistic.

The 1980 [[animation|animated]] film ''[[Animalympics]]'' is a spoof of the Olympic Games and features [[anthropomorphic]]ised animals.  In the combination [[live action]] and [[animation]] film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', animated animals play a game of [[association football|football]].  Similarly, several television commercials used the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] and other animals in live-action and [[Computer animation|CGA]] roles to appear to be playing [[American football]].

From 1976 to 1999, the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[One Man and His Dog]]'', a television series about sheepdog trials.  They also commissioned three series of ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'', a [[game show]] with contestants' pets having to perform in various tasks.

''[[Man vs. Beast]]'' is an American television show that pitches humans against animals in a variety of unusual challenges, including [[competitive eating]] between world champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and a [[brown bear]].

'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

{{Nihongo|'''''Attack on Titan'''''|進撃の巨人|Shingeki no Kyojin|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "Advancing Giant"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Hajime Isayama]]. The series began in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine]]'' on September 9, 2009, and has been collected into 26 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes as of August 2018. It is set in a world where humanity lives in cities surrounded by enormous walls protecting the humans from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as titans.

''Attack on Titan'' has become a commercial success. As of October 2018, the manga has 86{{nbsp}}million ''tankōbon'' copies in print worldwide (76 million in Japan and 10 million outside of Japan), making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-03/roundup-of-newly-revealed-print-counts-for-manga-light-novel-series-october-2018/.137530|title=Roundup of Newly Revealed Print Counts for Manga, Light Novel Series – October 2018|last=Hodgkins|first=Crystalyn|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 3, 2018|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the manga's anime adaptation, which received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, music and story, boosted the series' popularity. Although it also gained fame in neighboring Asian countries, the series' themes have been a subject of controversy.&lt;!--This refers to South Korean media claiming it has a "militaristic message" and death threats that the author received for modelling a character after an Imperial Japanese Army general, both sourced in the reception section.--&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
Over 100 years before the beginning of the story on an alternate world, giant humanoid creatures called {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Titans|Titans]]|巨人|Kyojin}} suddenly appeared and nearly wiped out humanity, devouring them without remorse or reason and only targeting them; they completely ignore other wildlife. What remains of humanity now resides within three enormous [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]]: the outermost is {{nihongo4|Wall Maria|ウォール・マリア|Wōru Maria}}; the middle wall is {{nihongo4|Wall Rose|ウォール・ローゼ|Wōru Rōze|sometimes pronounced like ''[[rosé]]''}} and the innermost is {{nihongo4|Wall Sheena|ウォール・シーナ|Wōru Shīna|alt. "Wall Sina"}}. Inside these walls, humanity has lived in uneasy peace for one hundred years, many people growing up without ever having seen a Titan. This all changes when one day, a [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Colossal Titan|giant {{convert|60|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}}-tall Colossus Titan]] mysteriously appears after a strike of lightning and breaches the outer wall (which is 50 meters tall) of the Shiganshina district, a town at Wall Maria, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the district. An [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Armored Titan|Armored Titan]] smashes clean through the gate in Wall Maria, forcing humankind to abandon the land between Wall Maria and Wall Rose, evacuating the remaining population into the inner districts. The sudden influx of population causes turmoil and famine.

The Titans are giant humanoid figures ranging between {{convert|3|and|15|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} tall and are usually masculine in body structure but lack reproductive organs. Although they do not appear to need food, they instinctively attack and eat humans on sight; it is mentioned that they derive their energy from sunlight. Furthermore, the Titans also do not have a proper digestive tract; once they have eaten their fill of human prey, Titans will vomit large, slimy balls, derisively referred to as "hairballs", as shown in the episode where the squad retakes Trost. Finally, their skin is tough and difficult to penetrate, and they regenerate quickly from injuries, except for a weak spot at the [[nape]] of their neck.

Combating the Titans is the military, which is divided into three branches. Foremost in the story is the {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Survey Corps|Survey Corps]]|調査兵団|Chōsa Heidan}}, which goes out into Titan territory to try to reclaim the land. The Survey Corps is heavily derided in society because of its apparently senseless high casualty rate and little sense of progress. The second and largest branch is the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Garrison Regiment|Garrison Regiment]]|駐屯兵団|Chūton Heidan}}, which guards the walls and the civilian populace. The third branch is the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Military Police Brigade|Military Police Brigade]]|憲兵団|Kenpeidan}}, which guards the royal family and lives relatively relaxed lives in the innermost wall, although this eventually results in fraud, corruption, and political subterfuge. The soldiers use a grappling, tethering system called {{nihongo4|Vertical Maneuvering Equipment|立体機動装置|Rittai Kidō Sōchi}} that allows them to jump onto (and swing from) walls, trees, or nearby buildings to attack Titans with dual swords, and use gas canisters which to propel themselves. However, despite it being the soldiers' primary line of both offense and defense against the Titans, it is useless in open and flat terrain like fields.

It is later revealed that the Titans were created when Ymir Fritz found the "source of all organic life" and became the Founding Titan which gave her the ability to create and control the Titans. When Ymir Fritz died as a side effect of having the Titan ability for 13 years, her power was divided among nine who pass their abilities to another upon death to other Subjects of Ymir, also known the Eldian people. These Titans consist of the Founding Titan, the Attack Titan, the Colossal Titan, the Armored Titan, the Female Titan, the Beast Titan, the Jaw Titan, the Cart Titan, and the War Hammer Titan. The Founding Titan remained with the Fritz family as Eldia's 145th King Karl Fritz arranged for his country's fall by the country of Marley and took a handful of his people to the island of Paradis where he used the countless Colossus Titans to make the walls and erased the memories of the Eldians he brought with him so that they did not know anything about the outside world, his descendants continuing his work while the Eldians in Marley suffer as second-class citizen with some being exiled to Paradis as the Titans that terrorize the island's residents.

===Plot===
{{main|List of Attack on Titan characters}}
The story of ''Attack on Titan'' revolves around the adventures of [[Eren Jeager]] who lives in the town of Shinganshina. When Wall Maria is breached by the Colossal Titan, with the Armored Titan further compromising the town, chaos ensues as the Titans enters Shinganshina causing a mass evacuation. Eren vows to kill all the Titans after watching in horror as a smiling Titan eats his mother, [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Carla Yeager|Carla]], his father having mysteriously disappeared after giving him a key to their basement. He then enlists in the military with his friends following suit.

Five years later, the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost District, one of the border towns jutting out of Wall Rose when the Colossal Titan again appears. In the ensuing battle, Eren appears to have been killed when he sacrificed himself to save Armin from being eaten by a bearded Titan. Things appear bleak until Mikasa and Armin encounter a Titan that uncharacteristically attacks the other Titans with raging fury. The creature is ultimately revealed to be Eren. However, he is considered to be a threat despite helping take back Trost District, and the following military trial rules that Eren is to be assigned to the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad under [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Levi|Captain Levi Ackerman]].

In an expedition to Shinganshina to make use of Eren's abilities, the Scouts are attacked by a [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Female Titan|Female Titan]] who attempts to capture Eren while wiping out Levi's subordinates. Although Eren is rescued, the expedition ended in failure, however Armin concludes that the Female Titan is a fellow cadet from their class named Annie Leonheart. Annie encases herself in crystal when her capture at Stohess is assured, and the collateral damage reveals that the walls are formed from Titans. Eventually, Eren learns that their fellow cadets, Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover, are the Titans who compromised Wall Maria. It is revealed that they and Annie are dispatched by an unknown party to capture Eren as he possesses "The Coordinate" which allows him to control Titans. The event also reveals another cadet named [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Krista Lenz|Krista Lenz]] is actually Historia Reiss, the illegitimate daughter of the city's true ruler Rod Reiss. On Reiss's orders, the Military Police take Eren and Historia to him. It is revealed that Eren's Titan abilities resulted from his father Grisha stealing the power of the Reiss family during the chaos at Shinganshina and allowing himself to be devoured by his son, Eren.

Historia learns that her father intends to make her a Titan and eat Eren to claim her birthright and restore the old system. Historia refuses and aids Eren and the Survey Corps in overthrowing the monarchy while personally killing Reiss after he transforms himself into a Titan. The ordeal enables Eren to gain a new power that allowed him to create massive and permanent structures, which the Survey Corps used in their next expedition to seal the breach in Wall Maria. However, the group are ambushed by [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Zeke|Zeke]], Reiner and Bertolt's superior. The Scouts win the ensuing Battle of Shinganshina, subduing Bertolt and forcing the other enemy Titans to retreat, but most of the expedition members are killed, and Armin and Commander [[List of Attack on Titan characters#Erwin Smith|Erwin Smith]] are left mortally wounded.  Levi, armed with a single vial of Titanization serum, decides to save Armin over Erwin.  Armin devours Bertolt and becomes the new Colossus Titan.

Before returning home, the survivors reach the basement of the Jeager residence where they find the truth Grisha wanted them to learn: That human civilization is thriving despite what they had believed and that they are descendants of some of the Eldian people who fled to Paradis to escape oppression by Marley, a world power that seeks to acquire Paradis's natural resources by force. The mindless Titans are revealed to be exiled Eldian prisoners. The Marleyans used to keep the Eldians within the walls from expanding their territory prior to sending Zeke, who Eren learns is his older half-brother who had their father exiled to Paradis. But events led Grisha to acquire the power of the Attack Titan which he later passed to Eren along with the Founding Titan, nicknamed the "Coordinate" by the Marleyans.

The series then jumps to four years after the Battle of Shinganshina and the reclaim of Wall Maria, flashbacks revealing Zeke having made contact with Paradis during that period through his conscripted emissary Yelena, who helped the Paradisians receive training in modern weapons and technology while establishing contact with other nations opposing Marley like Hizuru, an ally nation of Eldia, with Mikasa revealed to be a descendant of its shogun. During a military committee meeting, Yelena reveals Zeke's long term plan, to hand over the Beast Titan power to Historia to help Eren unlock his Founding Titan powers. Because of the 13-year lifespan of one who acquires a Titan's power, Historia accepts the burden to produce as many heirs as possible to ensure a line of succession in the 50 years it would take for Paradis to be fully modernized.  Eren disapproves of this arrangement and instead infiltrates Marley on his own, but secretly sends messages back to Paradis to coordinate an attack on Marley.

Eren and the Survey Corps begins their attack during a rally held by Willy Tybur, patriarch of Marley's most influential political family, in the Marleyan city of Liberio.  Eren kills Tybur and then devours Tybur's sister to obtain the power of the Warhammer Titan. After retreating with the Survey Corps on an airship piloted by a foreign dignitary, Eren is immediately arrested for his insubordination by Levi. The Survey Corps' celebration is short-lived when Sasha Blouse is mortally wounded by Gabi Braun - Reiner's cousin and expected successor to the Armor Titan - who had stowed away on the airship along with her friend Falco.

The Scouts return to Paradis victorious, despite their losses.  It is revealed that Historia is pregnant with her first child. Yelena and her followers are taken captive by the military government, and Levi escorts Zeke to a campsite in the forest. After Sasha's burial, the squad begins to question Eren's sanity and loyalty to them over the government and Zeke, despite Mikasa's insistence that he is acting in their best interests.  Meanwhile, Falco and Gabi manage to break free from prison after disabling one of their jailers, and escape into the forest, eventually making their way to Sasha's father's farmstead.

Concurrently, news of Eren's actions in Marley and subsequent imprisonment are leaked to the media, provoking mass outrage from the general populace, who support Eren's actions. The leaks originated from a band of nationalist rebels within the Survey Corps, led by Floch Forster, who view Eren as their leader. The rebels are promptly imprisoned, but their actions inspire more members of the military to join their cause; Commander-in-Chief Darius Zackly, the head of the military, is assassinated by a bomb placed by Eren's supporters, moments after he denied Armin and Mikasa permission to visit Eren. In the chaos, Eren escapes from his cell and meets up with his followers, informing them that their next objective is to find Zeke. In the aftermath of Zackly's death, Dot Pyxis assumes control and orders that Queen Historia and all individuals who know of Zeke's location be secured, planning on using both as bargaining chips in order to negotiate peace with Eren's followers, now called the Yeagerists.

It is these mysteries that critic Tomofusa Kure says amplifies readers' expectations. The artwork of the manga has been criticized as crude by some reviewers, with Isayama himself admitting his drawings are "amateurish." However, those same critics stated that after years of serialization, the art has been improving, and Kure believes that had the illustrations been "refined", it would not have conveyed the "eeriness" that is a key characteristic of the work.&lt;ref name="amateur art"/&gt; In a short review, [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] noted how the characters conveniently receive "power-ups" to create plot twists, but concluded that these said plot twists and the manga's post-apocalyptic world are "too good to miss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-11-14 |title=House of 1000 Manga – Crunchyroll Manga |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222002301/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-11-14 |archivedate=December 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Kimlinger from [[Anime News Network]] was sharply critical of the first two episodes of the anime adaptation. He did praise the show for "[bringing] back the terror of the [[fee-fi-fo-fum]] set", but then said that it "does not a good show make". Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/carl | title=The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide | author=Kimlinger, Carl | date=April 4, 2013 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408093522/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/carl | archivedate=April 8, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca | title=The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide | author=Silverman, Rebecca | date=April 3, 2013 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407042606/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca | archivedate=April 7, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that "few get as close to perfection as ''Attack on Titan'' does".

For instance, coverage of the anime appeared on the front page of the [[Hong Kong]] free newspaper ''[[am730]]'' on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="am730"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.am730.com.hk/article.php?article=156271&amp;d=2053 | title=''Attack on Titan'' explosive hit in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan – 4 million YouTube hits – Netizens debate walls under siege (《進擊の巨人》爆紅中港台 Youtube點擊400萬 網民熱議圍牆抗敵) | work=[[am730]] | date=May 27, 2013 | accessdate=June 27, 2013 | location=Hong Kong | page=1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607165648/http://www.am730.com.hk/article.php?article=156271&amp;d=2053 | archivedate=June 7, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also attracted criticism: the [[South Korea]]n ''Electronic Times'' magazine accused ''Attack on Titan'' of having a militaristic message that serves [[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]]'s political leanings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2013/new/jun/12/today-int7.htm | title=A revival of militarism?

Because many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors, it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Thousand Death Threats Against a Popular Anime Creator|url=http://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221|accessdate=July 1, 2013|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 1, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703032314/http://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central political message of breaking free from the prison of collective historical guilt imposed by a decadent ruling class echoes the nationalist political wave sweeping the globe in the late 2010s, as well as drawing criticism from its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferdinand |first1=Rueben |title=Attack on Titan: horror and the aesthetics of fascism |url=https://medium.com/@urbanfriendden/attack-on-titan-horror-aesthetics-and-authoritarianism-e98f7325a893 |website=Medium |accessdate=17 November 2018 |ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents at the University of Texas==
In 2012 there were multiple incidences of balloons allegedly filled with bleach thrown at students between the months of June and September. Four students filed reports with the UT police department, which were followed by protests from students, faculty, and alumni. The students who filed reports came forward once they were contacted by the UT police department. They had heard of the incidents and were concerned as to why the students had not already reported what happened. The students reported that the incidents took place near apartments in West Campus, an area located just off campus. The UT police have not been able to prove that there was in fact bleach in the balloons, but it has been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/bleach-balloons-launched-students-color-university-texas/story?id=17384662 |title=Bleach Balloons Launched at Students of Color at University of Texas |publisher=ABC News |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent incident occurred on August 21, 2013 to a 21-year-old student by the name of Bryan Davis while walking to a friend's house. He was reportedly struck in the leg by a bleach-filled balloon while walking by an apartment in [[West Campus, Austin, Texas|West Campus]]. This event was also looked at as being not only physically dangerous, but potentially racially driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/university-of-texas-bleach-bomb-bryan-davis_n_3818280.html |title=University Of Texas Investigates Another Possible 'Bleach Bomb' Attack Against Minority Student |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2013-08-26|accessdate=2013-12-18 |first=Meredith |last=Bennettsmith}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon further investigation and forensic testing, the balloon was confirmed to only have contained water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2013/08/28/statement-regarding-bleach-balloon-report/ |title=UT Austin Statement Regarding Reported Bleach Balloon Incident |publisher=Utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other occurrences==
In 2010, a bleach balloon attack was reported in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. It was reported that four high school students threw bleach balloons from a van at a Hispanic, male seventh grader who was walking home from school. The seventh grader, Miguel Mesa, was temporarily blinded upon being struck directly in the face. Two of Mesa's classmates called the police and were able to describe the van's appearance. The driver of the van was identified and arrested, the other three turned themselves in. The suspects told police they were only trying to ruin Mesa's clothing. No information was given or discussed on the possibilities of the attack having racist intentions. Mesa's vision returned after undergoing numerous medical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Alexis |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/4-in-custody-for-bleach-balloon-attack/nQgWr/ |title=4 in custody for bleach balloon attack |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further back, in 2005, another racial attack with the use of bleach was reported in the [[Netherlands]]. A 16-year-old girl from [[Ethiopia]] was walking with some friends when a 25-year-old male threw bleach on her. As he threw the bleach he yelled, "This will make you whiter". The girl was not seriously hurt, and the man was arrested for assault and hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Bleach-used-in-racist-attack-20050830 |title=Bleach used in racist attack |publisher=News24.com |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense and related incidents==
The response from the university is that the balloon thrown in August 2013 appears to have been filled with only water, and they sent clothing and pieces of the balloon away for further forensic testing. Authorities claim that they had difficulty verifying that these were racially motivated because there were reports that claim that non-minority students have been hit also but the fact remains that a majority of students targeted have indeed been minority. Sources who were interviewed by the [[Huffington Post]], who wished to be remain anonymous, claimed that as early as 2007, there had been bleach-filled balloons dropped on groups of women participating in sorority rush. They also claimed that bleach-bombing incidents are common and may occur "maybe once or twice a month."

A '''body swap''' is a [[Literary technique|storytelling device]] seen in a variety of science and supernatural fiction, in which two people (or beings) exchange minds and end up in each other's bodies. In media such as television and film, the device is an opportunity for two actors to temporarily play each other's characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/20677/6-staples-of-sci-fi-and-fantasy-television|title=6 staples of sci-fi and fantasy television|author=|date=|website=denofgeek.us|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315042020/http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/20677/6-staples-of-sci-fi-and-fantasy-television|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some cases, dialogue is [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by the original actors.

There are different types of body swapping. For non-technology swapping, switches can be caused by [[magic item]]s such as amulets, heartfelt [[wish]]es, or just strange quirks of the [[universe]]. The switches typically reverse after the subjects have expanded their [[world view]]s, gained a new appreciation for each other's troubles by literally "walking in another's shoes" and/or caused sufficient amounts of [[farce]]. Notable examples include the books ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' (1882)&lt;!-- No, that's STILL NOT a typo --&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allreaders.com/Topics/Info_17775.asp|title=Vice Versa by F.

Switches accomplished by technology, exempting gadgets [[Clarke's three laws|advanced sufficiently]] to appear as magic, are the fare of [[mad scientist]]s. Body-swapping devices are usually characterized by a highly experimental status, straps, helmets with many complicated cables that run to a central system and a tendency to direly malfunction before their effects can be reversed. Those without such means may resort to [[whole-body transplant|brain transplant]]s. Such experiments can have overtones of [[Horror fiction|horror]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}. The natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in eliciting laughter by releasing tension in acting clumsy or rendering themselves helpless.{{cite journal| last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Devil%2Bclown%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |title=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity.edu|accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624001158/http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Circus clown}}

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Peter Berger writes that "It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society".&lt;ref name="BergerP78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name="CalleryP64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

The series has spawned several [[manga]] works, an [[anime]] [[OVA]] series, [[drama CD]]s, theme park attractions, and two live action films.

==Gameplay==
''Corpse Party'' is a linear [[horror game|horror monster]] [[adventure game]] with some [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements. It is played in a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]], [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]]. Players are tasked with exploring the haunted school grounds for a means of escape. To fulfill this task, characters must interact with the environment and surroundings such as picking up objects, talking to other characters, and inspecting documents while avoiding enemy-like entities.

The game's story is split into five chapters, each focusing on different characters and featuring multiple endings that are achieved based on the player's in-game decisions: a "True Ending" required for the game's progression; and several "Wrong Endings" that are unlocked when the player performs events irrelevant to the main storyline. Characters also possess [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP), which measure how much damage they can take before dying, in some instances leading to a wrong ending. As players progress through the game, they will unlock ten optional "Extra Chapters", vignettes that focus on the game's side characters and expand the storyline.

==Setting and plot==
The plot of the ''Corpse Party'' series concerns a group of Japanese high school students who, after celebrating their school's culture festival, are telling ghost stories when a sudden [[earthquake]] transports them to a dilapidated schoolhouse in an alternative dimension that is haunted by the ghosts of people who have been trapped there. The main playable character is Satoshi Mochida, a kindhearted high school student who is teased by his classmates for his cowardly nature. Three of the other characters are students from Satoshi's class: Naomi Nakashima, Satoshi's childhood friend; Yoshiki Kishinuma, an intimidating yet good-natured student; and Ayumi Shinozaki, the class representative. Rounding out the group is Yuka Mochida, Satoshi's younger sister. The game's antagonist is the red ghost of a teenage girl who seeks vengeance for her wrongful death.

===''Blood Covered'' and ''Repeated Fear''===
''Blood Covered'', released in 2008, is an enhanced remake and port of the 1996 ''Corpse Party''. It includes more characters, larger maps, updated graphics, and professional voice actors. It was later followed by another enhanced remake, ''Blood Covered: Repeated Fear'', which was released internationally as ''Corpse Party''.

The remake thoroughly expands the plot and setting of the original game. Here, the haunted schoolhouse is named {{Nihongo|Heavenly Host Elementary School|天神小学校|Tenjin Shōgakkō}}, a fictional [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]] [[elementary school]] that was torn down following the murders and disappearances of several of its staff and students. In modern-day Japan, the main characters' high school, {{Nihongo|Kisaragi Academy|如月学園|Kisaragi Gakuen}}, has been built over the elementary school site. The students are transported to Heavenly Host after performing a charm called {{Nihongo|Sachiko Ever After|幸せのサチコさん|Shiawase no Sachiko-san}}, which would supposedly allow them to remain friends for eternity.

In addition to the five protagonists of the original game, ''Blood Covered'' introduces four characters to the playable cast: Seiko Shinohara, Naomi's best friend; Mayu Suzumoto, a popular student due to transfer out of Kisaragi; Sakutaro Morishige, Mayu's best friend; and Yui Shishido, the class's homeroom teacher. ''Blood Covered'' also includes several characters from other schools who are also trapped inside Heavenly Host and affect the story. Two notable characters are Naho Saenoki, a selfish but helpful paranormalist from {{Nihongo|Paulownia Academy|桐章学園|Kirishō Gakuen}} who discovered the Sachiko Ever After charm and came to investigate Heavenly Host; and Yuuya Kizami, a sadistic student from {{Nihongo|Byakudan Senior High School|白壇高等学校|Byakudan Kōtōgakkō}} who accompanies Yuka as she is separated from her brother. The red ghost is re-envisioned as a young child named Sachiko Shinozaki who kills the students of Heavenly Hosts in anger over her and her mother's murder.

===''Book of Shadows''===
A sequel to ''Blood Covered'', ''Book of Shadows'' features a series of nonlinear chapters that add new twists and backgrounds for various characters and details important to the storyline. The game mostly takes place during the same time the first game did, continuing from one of the "wrong ends" in ''Corpse Party'', where Sachiko sends the Kisaragi Academy students back in time. For this purpose, she erases their memories except for Satoshi's. He tries in a desperate attempt to dissuade his classmates from performing the charm, but he joins them, not wanting to let them go alone, sending them on alternative course of actions and encountering several supporting victims in Heavenly Host.

The game's prologue, ''Blood Drive'', serves as the set up to the [[#Blood Drive|eponymous sequel]]. Two weeks after escaping Heavenly Host, Ayumi and Naomi go to investigate the Shinozaki estate, Sachiko's birthplace, believing there is hope in reviving their dead friends since Naho and Kou Kibiki's existences were not erased like the other victims. At the estate, Ayumi discovers that she is of the same lineage as Sachiko. Hearing an eerie voice, Ayumi uncovers a magical tome known as the Book of Shadows. Ayumi and Naomi perform a resurrection spell for Mayu, but fail. As compensation for using black magic, the book unleashes its rage upon Ayumi until her older sister Hinoe Shinozaki rushes in and saves Ayumi, at the cost of her own life.

===''Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash''===
On the day of Sachiko's birth and death, the curse on her weakens and she gets 24 hours to celebrate her birthday as someone closer to the girl she was before her death. She uses the timeloops as established in ''Corpse Party: Book of Shadows'' to force all survivors at that point to participate in activities she has set up. Given it's either that or die horribly again, something all are aware that they've already experienced but can't remember in full, they go along with her demands. The game features almost all characters from the previous games and some new ones. While a pseudo-horror spin-off at best, it is part of the storyline, setting up a few details to prepare for ''Corpse Party: Blood Drive''.

As with ''Corpse Party: Book of Shadows'', there is only one extra chapter. This extra chapter takes place during the previous game and is more conventional horror. It tells of Yoshiki's and Ayumi's encounter with four students from Sugatani Senior High School, notably Azusa Takai.

===''Blood Drive''===
''Corpse Party: Blood Drive'' is the direct sequel to ''Corpse Party: Book of Shadows'', and is the first game featuring settings and characters rendered in 3D. The game was released for the [[PlayStation Vita]] in Japan in July 2014 by 5pb. The characters are depicted in 3D [[Super deformed|chibi]] style, however traditional CG artwork appears during cutscenes, illustrated by Sakuya Kamishiro.&lt;ref name=blooddrive_sil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/03/20/details-corpse-party-blood-drives-story-new-characters/ |title=More Details On Corpse Party: Blood Drive's Story And New Characters |work=Siliconera |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing from the prologue, Naomi manages to save Ayumi and takes her to a hospital. The Shinozaki estate and tome subsequently vanish without a trace. Ayumi had been severely ill for her misuse of the Book of Shadows' black magic. In the hospital, a woman claiming to be a spiritual associate of Hinoe's visits Ayumi. This woman belongs to the Wiccan Institute, an organization that worships spirits. She tells her Hinoe's last wish, which is to regain the Book of Shadows or the world will fall into the abyss. This is partially a lie, as the woman is under threat of other organizations to get Ayumi to find the book, which they wish to use for their own gain.

After being discharged from the hospital two months later, Ayumi returns to Kisaragi Academy where Satoshi and friends give her a warm welcome. However, the absence of their dead friends is a constant reminder of their inevitable reality. A new teacher's assistant, Kuon Niwa, supervises their homeroom. Later, on her way home, a black hooded boy approaches Ayumi and tells her, "If you reclaim the Book of Shadows and use it at Heavenly Host, those who have died there will be revived." Ayumi pledges that she will once more take back the Book of Shadows. The trail leads into the previous residence of Makina Shinozaki. To make matters worse, Heavenly Host's curse is expanded by the "new Sachiko", later named Sachi.&lt;ref name=blooddrive_sil/&gt;

In January 2017, the game was ported to Android and iOS. The port contained various improvements to the balance of the game and improved loading times. In addition to that, the game also supports a cloud saving feature.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dualshockers.com/corpse-party-blood-drive-launches-ios-android-new-screenshots/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Dialogue''', in fiction, is a verbal exchange between two or more characters. If there is only ''one'' character talking aloud, it is a [[monologue]].

==Identifiers==
''"This breakfast is making me sick," George said.''

The ''George said'' is the identifier. ''Said'' is the [[verb]] most writers use because reader familiarity with ''said'' prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as ''ask'', ''shout'', or ''reply'' are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:

''"Hello," he croaked nervously, "my name's Horace."''&lt;br&gt;
''"What's yours?" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
another example is:
"My name is Peg, what's yours?" I asked.
"My name is William, but my friends call me Will," said Will.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', expresses his belief that ''said'' is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by [[Larry McMurtry]], who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|King|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitutes are known as ''said-bookisms''. For example, in the sentence ''"What do you mean?" he smiled.'', the word ''smiled'' is a said-bookism.

'''''Double Dare''''' is an American television [[game show]] on which two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing messy stunts known as physical challenges. It originally ran from 1986 to 1993. A revival ran in 2000, and a new revival began on June 25, 2018.

Hosted by [[Marc Summers]], the program originally premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. The series saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, ''Double Dare'' had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon’s afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on [[cable television]]. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television, and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children. ''Double Dare'' remains Nickelodeon's longest-running game show. In January 2001, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows.

A continuation for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as ''Family Double Dare'', airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued ''Family Double Dare'', premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by [[Jason Harris Katz|Jason Harris]], and titled ''Double Dare 2000''; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by [[Liza Koshy]] and featuring Marc Summers, premiered on June 25, 2018.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
Each team on the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' consisted of two children, while teams on ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'' included two adults and two children.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after ''Double Dare'' entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;

Each round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled.&lt;ref name="86 episode"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Prosecutors vs. Mad Avengers|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', a question was initially worth $10. On ''Family Double Dare'' and ''Double Dare 2000'', a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 ''Double Dare'', a question is initially worth $50.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD2k premiere"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare 2000|title=100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd vs. The Amanda Show|network=Nickelodeon|date=January 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 premiere"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=The Mad Dogs vs. Line Drive 25|network=Nickelodeon|date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the toss-up at the start of the first round, the host explains the rules as follows:

{{cquote|I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you either have to answer that question or take the physical challenge.&lt;ref name="FDD"&gt;{{cite episode|title=McGoldrick vs. O'Donnell|series=Family Double Dare|network=Fox|date=April 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18 premiere"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Wildcats vs. Mighty Midgets|series=Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 13, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1992 show"&gt;{{cite episode|series=NBA All-Star Double Dare|network=Nickelodeon|date=February 8, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Physical challenges===
[[File:Family Double Dare spaghetti challenge.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 1990 ''Family Double Dare'' toss-up physical challenge showing two contestants trying to catch a "meatball" in a bowl of "spaghetti."]]
Physical challenges are often messy stunts&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on ''Double Dare 2000'' were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt;

Many challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during "Pies in the Pants," a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Susan |title=Marc Summers: Kidding Around, Seriously |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=August 25, 1991 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411140547/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-25/news/tv-1666_1_marc-summers |archivedate=April 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the original ''Double Dare'' and ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'', both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges. For the 1988 version of ''Family Double Dare'', all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990–93 version of ''Family Double Dare'' and on ''Double Dare 2000'', two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two. All members of a team competed in physical challenges on the 2018 ''Double Dare''.&lt;ref name="86 episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD2k premiere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1992 show"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triplets"&gt;{{cite episode|series=Double Dare|title=Team Triple Threat vs. Wonder Triplet Power|network=Nickelodeon|date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double Dare 2000'' introduced the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt;

===Obstacle course===
[[File:Double Dare - Obstacle Course - Slide (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Sundae Slide being prepared on a 1987 ''Double Dare'' obstacle course.]]
The team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the [[obstacle course]] (renamed the Slopstacle Course for ''Double Dare 2000''). From the original ''Double Dare'' through ''Double Dare 2000'' both teams keep all money earned, regardless of the outcome.&lt;ref name="1992 show"/&gt; Only the winning team on the 2018 version gets to keep their money.&lt;ref name="18 premiere"/&gt; 

The course consists of eight obstacles which have to be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member runs the first obstacle, then passes its flag to a partner, who then moves on to the next obstacle. The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt; For safety reasons, team members are given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.&lt;ref name=Boys/&gt;

Many obstacles have appeared in the course rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life.&lt;ref name=Floss&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 Slimiest Stunts of Double Dare |publisher=[[Mental Floss]] |last=Rossen |first=Jake |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |date=August 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309061028/http://mentalfloss.com/article/67581/no-small-splatter-10-slimiest-stunts-double-dare |archivedate=March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized [[hamster wheel]]; Pick It, a giant [[human nose]] with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a [[playground slide]] with [[ice cream]] at the bottom; and Gum Drop, which required contestants to leap into a giant [[gumball machine]] filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Floss/&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Club"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eakin|first=Marah|title="It smelled like death": An oral history of the Double Dare obstacle course|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/it-smelled-death-oral-history-double-dare-obstacle-245939|work=[[The A.V.

The team wins a prize for each obstacle completed, escalating in value up to a grand prize for completing the entire course.&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt; Two-person teams split the cash earnings, and both contestants receive the same prize for each obstacle. Prizes have included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, electronics, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox ''Family Double Dare'', cash.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; On the original and ''Super Sloppy'' versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]]. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Screaming Meatballs vs. Shamalama Ding Dongs|series=Double Dare|network=Syndication|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Fox ''Family Double Dare'', as well as the first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinman |first=Catherine |title=Family Ties?

In the mid-1980s, [[Nickelodeon]] was approached by production and consulting groups with the idea of doing a game show for children, a first for the network.&lt;ref name=Thrillist&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Barry|title=An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Double Dare|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/an-oral-history-of-nickelodeons-double-dare|work=[[Thrillist Media Group|Thrillist]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017|date=October 7, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120230713/https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/an-oral-history-of-nickelodeons-double-dare |archivedate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic.&lt;ref name=Boys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last=Schenider |first=Michael |title=Double Dare Reunion: The Secrets Behind the Nickelodeon Series’ Unlikely Origins – and Potential Rebirth |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/double-dare-nickelodeon-marc-summers-reunion-1201749512/ |work=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |date=November 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307210357/http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/double-dare-nickelodeon-marc-summers-reunion-1201749512/ |archivedate=March 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, [[Truth or dare?|truth or dare]], and the board game [[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]].&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt; The [[Television pilot|pilot]] presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby.&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt; ''Double Dare'' was [[green-light]]ed and announced in June 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Burgeoning world of cable programming|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting]]|date=June 16, 1986|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|page=10|via=American Radio History|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial candidates to host the program included [[Soupy Sales]], host of children's [[variety show]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian [[Dana Carvey]]. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the search for a host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from [[New York City|New York]] or [[Los Angeles]]. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television [[Opening act|warm-up]] comedian [[Marc Summers]] was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.957thegame.com/media/audio-channel/damon-bruce-show-w-marc-summers-hour-3 |host=[[Damon Bruce|Bruce, Damon]] and Franco, Gianna|title=Damon Bruce Show w/ Marc Summers Hour 3 |website=The Damon Bruce Show |publisher=[[KGMZ-FM|KGMZ]] |date=July 13, 2017 |access-date=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host ''Double Dare''. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position in the first week of September 1986.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|host=Shostak, Stu |title=Program 494 |website=Stu's Show |date=April 12, 2017 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2017 |url-access=subscription |accessdate=April 12, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413234629/http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2017 |archivedate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers, then 34 years old, was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.&lt;ref name="Bruce"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-09-14/lifestyle/9109130751_1_double-dare-marc-summers-nickelodeon |title=Nick's Biggest Kid Is 39 |first=Catherine |last=Hinman |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=September 14, 1991 |accessdate=July 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In need of an announcer, ''Double Dare'' producers were made aware of [[Philadelphia]]-area radio host [[Harvey (announcer)|John Harvey]], known on-air as Harvey,&lt;ref name="Double Dare Book 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burr|first=Daniella|title=The Double Dare Game Book|publisher=[[Parachute Publishing|Parachute Press]]|year=1988|isbn=9780938753278}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''Harvey in the Morning'' program on [[WIOQ]] had been canceled months earlier. He accepted the offer to be announcer of the program.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt; Stage assistants also appeared on-camera on ''Double Dare'', initially only assisting in setting up physical challenges and obstacles, but expanding the role as the series continued to sometimes interacting with Summers, demonstrating challenges, and modeling prizes.&lt;ref name="Logo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Virtel |first=Louis |title=Vanna Men: A Brief History of Male Models on Game Shows |url=http://www.newnownext.com/vanna-men-a-brief-history-of-male-models-on-game-shows/10/2012/ |website=NewNowNext |publisher=[[Logo TV]] |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |date=October 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412224615/http://www.newnownext.com/vanna-men-a-brief-history-of-male-models-on-game-shows/10/2012/ |archivedate=April 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar were the two permanent stage assistants when the program began.&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EOTGS"/&gt;

James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor created the original stage design for ''Double Dare.'' The design for the original series' set was inspired by a 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the [[Memphis Group]]. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a [[checkerboard]] pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a ''[[natatorium]]'' (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a [[bathroom]].&lt;ref name="AV Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slimed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klickstein|first=Matthew|date=September 24, 2013|title=Slimed!: An Oral History of Nickelodeon’s Golden Age|publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|author-link=Mathew Klickstein|isbn=0142196851}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the original ''Double Dare'' music was composed by [[Edd Kalehoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About |work=[[Edd Kalehoff]] Music |url=http://www.eddkalehoff.com/about |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312071548/http://www.eddkalehoff.com/about |archivedate=March 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production originated at the studios of [[PBS]] affiliate [[WHYY-TV]] in Philadelphia, [[Pennsylvania]]. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce ''Double Dare'' because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York or Los Angeles where national television production is more common.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indie/&gt; The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gale|date=September 19, 1986|title=Kids game show being taped here|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|via =[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10683213/kids_game_show_being_taped_here/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Double Dare'' premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986.

In July 1987, pilots hosted by [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] were produced by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] for two possible versions of ''Double Dare'' with adult players: one pairing celebrities with contestants, and another with married couples. Neither concept advanced to a full series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eakin  |first=Marah  |title=Caitlyn Jenner trumped Scott Baio in this unaired Double Dare pilot from 1987 |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/caitlyn-jenner-trumped-scott-baio-unaired-double-d-245032 |work=[[The A.V.

A 13-episode Saturday night edition titled ''Family Double Dare'' aired on Fox from April 3 to July 23, 1988.

''Double Dare'' revitalized interest in the concept of a game show for children.&lt;ref name="DD2k"/&gt; Less than a year after the program launched, [[NBC]] had premiered ''[[I'm Telling!]]'',&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; [[Lorimar Television]] had announced plans for ''[[Fun House (U.S. game show)|Fun House]]'', and Nickelodeon's ''[[Finders Keepers (U.S. game show)|Finders Keepers]]'' began airing&amp;mdash;all shows based on competition between teams of children.&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwood |first1=Rick |title=A Kids' Show That Dared to Be Different |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-24/entertainment/ca-30884_1_game-show |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 24, 1987 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308044612/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-24/entertainment/ca-30884_1_game-show |archivedate=March 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Double Dare''{{'}}s first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[The Cross-Wits]]'' were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=November 23, 1987|title=Slide in children's animation viewing spurring live syndicated productions|magazine=[[Television/Radio Age (magazine)|Television/Radio Age]]|last=Sobel|first=Robert|page=58|via=American Radio History|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Radio-Age/Issues/80s/1987/1987-11-23-RTVA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that ''Double Dare'' "allowed kids to get dirty and have a good time in ways that really were not acceptable before that show".&lt;ref name="Fantasy"/&gt; ''Double Dare'' remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.&lt;ref name=Splat/&gt;

As ''Double Dare'' grew messier, a green slime substance became more commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]''. ''Double Dare'''s high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt; The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]], a slime [[geyser]] at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including ''Wild &amp; Crazy Kids'' and ''[[Figure It Out]]''. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date=May 31, 2016|title=A Brief History of Nickelodeon Slime|medium=Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpgWpXWJZmQ|access-date=July 6, 2017|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[NickSplat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===

Reviews of the show were often favorable, noting it was fun entertainment for the family. After ''Double Dare'' premiered, Kenneth R.

Some criticism came from the feeling that the program was not educational.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS To Unveil Geography Game Show Based on Popular Computer Character|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/09/25/04pbs.h11.html|work=[[Education Week]]|accessdate=March 6, 2017|date=September 25, 1991|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308044335/http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/09/25/04pbs.h11.html|archivedate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were concerned about [[food waste]] like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles.&lt;ref name=Thrillist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=C-4|title=Reader dares a boycott of 'Double Dare'|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|date=May 2, 1988|via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10684873/}}{{free access}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a "Cheers and Jeers" section in 1988, ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave "jeers" to ''Double Dare'' for "daring to push beyond the limits of good taste," saying it was "gross and insulting to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Cheers 'N' Jeers|magazine=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 25, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, television and film critic [[Jeffrey Lyons]] wrote that he "wouldn't dream of proclaiming that ''Super Sloppy Double Dare'' is good for your child.

===Portrayals and parodies===
''Double Dare'' has been featured in a number of notable visual media since its premiere, often with one or more characters participating as contestants in homages to the series. On "Double Dare", a 2016 episode of the 1980s-set sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Adam Goldberg ([[Sean Giambrone]]) tries to find the perfect partner to audition to be a contestant on ''Double Dare''. After rejecting his friend Emmy Mirsky (Stephanie Katherine Grant), he eventually runs through a mock obstacle course at a tryout with his grandfather Albert "Pops" Solomon ([[George Segal]]). Neither are selected to take part in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Double Dare|series=The Goldbergs|network=ABC|airdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Bauman and Amy Gross, real-life friends of series' creator [[Adam F. Goldberg]] who appeared as contestants on ''Double Dare'' in 1988, cameo as producers of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive First Look: The Goldbergs Plays Double Dare! |first=Joyce |last=Eng |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/exclusive-first-look-the-goldbergs-double-dare/ |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |date=January 14, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405074315/http://www.tvguide.com/news/exclusive-first-look-the-goldbergs-double-dare/ |archivedate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first-season episode of the 2013 Nickelodeon series ''[[Sanjay and Craig]]'' titled "Trouble Dare" features the titular characters (voiced by [[Maulik Pancholy]] and [[Chris Hardwick]]), along with Sanjay's mother and father (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] and [[Kunal Nayyar]]), leaving their home after a bug infestation. After asking Remington Tufflips (voiced by [[Chris D'Elia]]) to stay in his trailer, and finding that the Dickson family is already occupying it, Tufflips decides which family can stay through a game of ''Family Double Dare'' hosted by himself. Harvey (voiced by himself) is concerned with how Tufflips is running the game, until Marc Summers (voiced by himself) appears and declares Sanjay's family the winners of a night's sleep inside the Pick It obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Trouble Dare/Road Pizza|series=Sanjay and Craig|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Family Double Dare'' game is seen in the music video for rock band [[Good Charlotte]]'s 2011 single "[[Last Night (Good Charlotte song)|Last Night]]." The video shows an abridged game of ''Family Double Dare'', going through questions, physical challenges, and the obstacle course. Marc Summers appears as himself, guitarist [[Benji Madden]] appears as Harvey, and band members play contestants and stage assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|date=March 22, 2011|title=Last Night|people=Good Charlotte|medium=Music video|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1659905/good-charlotte-last-night/ |title=Good Charlotte's 'Last Night' Video A Tribute To 'Family Double Dare' |first=Kyle |last=Anderson |publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |date=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170123/http://www.mtv.com/news/1659905/good-charlotte-last-night/ |archivedate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double Dare'' has also been subject to parodies and spoofs in various forms. The October 1988 issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''  has a spoof of ''Double Dare'' called "Double Damp". Marc Summers and Harvey are lampooned as "Muck Slummers" and "Hardly". The piece mocked the program's use of food products, the dangerous nature of some stunts, and the similarity to game show ''[[Beat the Clock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DeBartolo|first1=Dick|last2=Torres|first2=Angelo|date=October 1988|title=Double Damp|magazine=Mad|publisher=[[EC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Summers and Harvey consider being parodied in ''Mad'' a high point in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Marc |url=http://www.marcsummerstv.com/about-marc/ |publisher=Marc Summers Productions |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082209/http://www.marcsummerstv.com/about-marc/ |archivedate=April 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spivack|first1=Emily|title=Worn Stories|date=August 26, 2014|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|isbn=1616892765|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 episode of the [[truTV]] sketch comedy series ''[[Friends of the People]]'' titled "Double Dare" guest stars Marc Summers as himself, hosting "banned" moments from ''Double Dare''.

"'''Geek girl'''" is a 20th-century term, signifying a gendered subgenre within the modern [[geek]] subculture.

== History ==
The return of the word "geek" in the mid-1990s can be traced to the popularization of workplace computing and the Internet and the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1995–2000. The early days of the [[Geek#Reclamation_and_self-identification|reclaimed use of "geek"]] were strongly associated with computers and information technology&lt;ref&gt;"geek, ''n.''. 1.c. "spec. A person who is extremely devoted to and knowledgeable about computers or related technology." ''Oxford English Dictionary'': http://www.oed.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of practitioners were male.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Feineman's ''Geek Chic: The Ultimate Guide to Geek Culture'' ({{ISBN|1584232056}}), both noted "the increasing power of women in the geek world" and, at the time of publication (1995), characterized the book's research as "an exercise in machismo. The women were hard to find" (17).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a 1996 study of high school cultures, linguist [[Mary Bucholtz]] noted that "nerd status is overwhelmingly associated with males"&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz, Mary. "Geek the Girl: Language, Femininity, and Female Nerds". ''Gender and Belief Systems''. Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Women and Language Conference. Ed. Natasha Warner, Jocelyn Ahlers, Leela Bilmes, Monica Oliver, Suzanne Wertheim and Melinda Chen. Berkeley: University of California, 1996. 119-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two studies by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) quantified the gap between men and women in computing and the continuing problems recruiting and retaining female programmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in Computing: Where Are We Now?" Klawe, Maria and Nancy Leveson. ''Communications of the ACM - Inspiring Women in Computing'' Volume 38.1: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klawe, Maria, Telle Whitney and Caroline Simard. "Women in Computing, Take 2" ''Communications of the ACM - Inspiring Women in Computing'' Volume 52.2: 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "Geekgirl" was coined by [[Rosie Cross]] in 1993 as the title of her online [[cyberfeminist]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geekgirl.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; This is Australia's longest running online publication and in September 1996 it was exhibited at the New Museum of Contemporary Art New York. Editions of this magazine from the mid 90's have been preserved by the Internet Archive.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/*/geekgirl.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;
As the use of the personal computer grew during the mid-to-late 2000s, the number of [[women in computing]] rose proportionately, and networks were created to provide support and connection for self-described "geek girls". GirlGeeks.org &lt;ref&gt;Official website, http://www.girlgeeks.org/. Accessed May 11th, 2011 at 10:55 am.&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 1999 to serve as "the source for women in computing",&lt;ref&gt;"History of GirlGeeks": http://www.girlgeeks.org/about/history.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 [[Girl Geek Dinners]] was formed to connect women in the [[information technology (IT)]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Girl Dinners: http://girlgeekdinners.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread recognition of "geek girls" as a community occurred in summer 2010, when the annual [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] included a panel entitled "Geek Girls Exist".&lt;ref&gt;Comic-Con 2010 schedule: http://www.comic-con.org/cci2010/cci10_prog_thu.php. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 9:41 pm. EST.&lt;/ref&gt; Panelists included StarWars.com journalist [[Bonnie Burton]], singer-songwriter [[Marian Call]], [[Tekzilla]] and [[Qore (PlayStation Network)|Qore]] host [[Veronica Belmont]], [[MythBusters]] featured host [[Kari Byron]], and was hosted by [[Kristin Rielly]], founder of Geek Girls Network. The panel's popularity&lt;ref&gt;"SDCC Recap: Geek Girls Exist Panel": http://geekgirlsnetwork.com/blog/2010/08/sdcc-recap-geek-girls-exist-panel/#more-1902. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 10:01 pm. EST&lt;/ref&gt; has been credited as a primary mover in solidifying the girl geek concept.

== Types ==
The term geek girl is in some ways fractured between its technical and cultural uses.  The strongest association remains with computing, IT, and engineering. Practicing "geek girls" then include video game executive [[Jade Raymond]], computer scientist and Yahoo! CEO [[Marissa Mayer]], social media developer [[Leah Culver]], and engineer [[Limor Fried]] of [[Adafruit Industries]].

"Geek girl" is also a term applied to women who engage in journalism and media about technology, typically through the Internet rather than traditional print media, such as tech journalist [[Natali Morris]].  Perhaps the most well-known variety of the "geek girl" is the [[gamer]], who typically engages in video and/or live [[role-playing games]].  In 2007, actress and gamer [[Felicia Day]] popularized the archetype through the webseries ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' and the YouTube viral video "[[(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar]]".

=== Fake geek girl === 
"Fake geek girl" is a [[pejorative]] term for a woman who is accused of feigning interest in [[geek]]y topics such as video games or comic books to get attention from men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dear Fake Geek Girls: Please Go Away|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarabrown/2012/03/26/dear-fake-geek-girls-please-go-away/#772519782afb|website = Forbes|access-date = |first = Tara Tiger|last = Brown|date = 26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic was the subject of controversy in 2012 and 2013, when multiple articles were published supporting or condemning the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Fake Geek Girls' Paranoia Is About Male Insecurity, Not Female Duplicity|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/fake-geek-girls-paranoia-is-about-male-insecurity-not-female-duplicity/267402/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = |language = en-US|first = Noah|last = Berlatsky|date = 22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://reagle.org/joseph/2014/fake/fake.html|title = Geek Policing: Fake Geek Girls and Contested Attention|last = Reagle|first = Joseph|date = 5 August 2015|journal = International Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy surrounding the concept of fake geek girls began in March 2012, when Tara Brown published an article on the ''[[Forbes]]'' website titled "Dear Fake Geek Girls: Please Go Away".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the article, she discussed the difference between geeky women as a social outcasts, and "pretentious females who have labeled themselves as a 'geek girl' [who have] figured out that guys will pay a lot of attention to them if they proclaim they are reading comics or playing video games."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Joe Peacock continued this criticism to discuss [[Promotional model|booth babes]] and female [[cosplay]]ers in a July 2012 blog post for [[CNN]] titled "Booth babes need not apply". In this article, he denounced women who pretend to be interested in geek culture to gain attention from men or to advance their [[Model (people)|modelling]] careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/24/booth-babes-need-not-apply/|title = Booth babes need not apply|last = Peacock|first = Joe|date = 24 July 2012|work = Geek Out!|publisher = [[CNN]]|accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic artist [[Tony Harris (artist)|Tony Harris]] wrote a Facebook post in November 2012, described by ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' as a "diatribe", about female cosplayers who were not knowledgeable about the characters they were representing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sexist rants against "fake geek girls" hit new low|url = http://www.dailydot.com/news/tony-harris-peacock-fake-geek-girls-cosplayers/|website = The Daily Dot|access-date = |last = Romano|first = Aja|date = 13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of fake geek girls has given rise to other phenomena, such as the "Idiot Nerd Girl" [[image macro]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Taking Back a Meme: Idiot Nerd Girl|url = http://www.thewire.com/national/2012/09/taking-back-meme-idiot-nerd-girl/56674/|website = The Wire|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-US|last = Zuckerman|first = Esther|date = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles prompted considerable response. Some people argued that fake geek girls did not exist, or were more rare than the criticism suggested. Kirk Hamilton wrote in ''[[Kotaku]]'' that people perceived to be fake geek girls simply had interests that varied, in aspect or degree, from those of a male reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fake Threat of Fake Geek Girls|url = http://kotaku.com/5896920/the-fake-threat-of-fake-geek-girls|website = Kotaku|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Kirk|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responses describe the criticism as [[Misogyny|misogynist]] and as a form of [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeping]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Fake Geek Girls': How Geek Gatekeeping Is Bad For Business|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2012/07/26/fake-geek-girls-gamer-edition/3/#241a8d082b01|access-date = 2016-02-11|last = Griffiths|first = Daniel Nye|date = 26 July 2012|publisher = Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In September 2010, the geek girl group [[Team Unicorn]] was formed by four "gamer girls", who produced the YouTube video "G33k &amp; G4m3r Girls" as a parody of the song [[California Gurls]] by Katy Perry. The video went viral within a week,&lt;ref&gt;Interview, "G33K &amp; G4M3R GIRLS (Geek and Gamer Girls Video) 1 Week, 1 Million Views": http://actionflickchick.com/superaction/g33k-g4m3r-girls-interview/.  Accessed on May 11th, 2011 at 2:10 pm. EST.&lt;/ref&gt; but the name of the group was intended to reflect the invisible status of women in the geek subculture: "Geek Girls: Like unicorns, we're not supposed to exist."

In late 2010, the [[Seattle]]-based non-profit GeekGirlCon announced that it would hold the first conference devoted to geek girls on October 8–9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to Geek Girl Con": http://www.geekgirlcon.com/welcome-to-geek-girl-con/. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 10:34 EST.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the New York Times' television reviewer [[Ginia Bellefante]] caused a minor uproar by characterizing the medieval-fantasy series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as "boy fiction" that "no woman alive" would wish to watch.&lt;ref&gt;Television review, "'Game of Thrones': A Fantasy World of Strange Feuding Kingdoms." http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/television/game-of-thrones-begins-sunday-on-hbo-review.html?pagewanted=print. Accessed on May 11th, 2011 at 9:50 am.&lt;/ref&gt; The review prompted a direct response from GeekGirlCon,&lt;ref&gt;"GeekGirlCon Responds to the NY Times and Bellafante’s Review of Game of Thrones": http://www.geekgirlcon.com/geekgirlcon-responds-to-the-ny-times-and-bellafantes-review-of-game-of-thrones/.

{{For|a full list of Gladiators events around the world|Category:Gladiators (franchise)}}
{{Unreferenced|date=September 2017}}
'''''Gladiators''''' is a [[sports entertainment]] television show that was an international success during the 1990s and early 2000s with versions of the show being filmed for local broadcasters in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Denmark]]. However, [[Russia]], [[Germany]], and [[the Bahamas]] would also compete in international shows during the series, despite the fact that they did not have their own domestic series.

After a lengthy break, ''Gladiators'' was revived in 2008 in the UK, the US and [[Australia]]; in 2009 [[Lebanon]] created their own series featuring competitors from all over the [[Arab]] region and most recently [[Sweden]] has brought back their version which is proving most successful of all revivals, with a new revival in [[Finland]] is set for broadcast in 2017.

The concept of the show is that athletic members of the public battle against the show's own Gladiators (often semi-professional or ex-athletes) to claim points in several [[Gladiators events|events]] that require speed, strength and skill. In the final event of the show, "The Eliminator" the contenders race against each other (with starting times based on previous events), with the first to finish winning the episode and moving onto the next round.

A children's derivative of the concept was also made in the US, called ''[[Gladiators 2000]]'' (1994–1996). A UK variant of this was aired starting in 1995, called ''[[Gladiators: Train 2 Win]]''.

==History==

===1990s success===
The initial concept for the show by Dan Carr and John C. Ferraro was held in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States|USA]] before being sold to Samuel Goldwyn Productions/MGM where the format was adapted and televised as ''[[American Gladiators]]'' with the first series airing over 1989–90. As the show progressed, new events were introduced along with new Gladiators, sometimes retiring previous Gladiators.

Following the success of ''American Gladiators'', other countries began to produce their own versions of the show with the [[UK]] and [[Finland]] starting production in 1992. ''American Gladiators'' had already picked up a cult following in the UK after being shown on late night TV. The [[Gladiators (UK TV series)|UK]], most noticeably adapted the concept into a large arena (the [[National Indoor Arena]] in [[Birmingham]]), glamorising the show, often adapting events from the American series as well as introducing many of their own, often more high-tech. Winners from the UK and Finnish series would then go over to America, to film a special show of ''American Gladiators'' in which they competed against the current American champions along with selected athletes from other territories such as [[Japan]] and the [[Bahamas]] and [[South Korea]].

In early 1995, the first full scale international competition was launched in which selected Gladiators from the American, Finnish and British series competed against contender champions from those three countries. A fourth country, Russia was added but as they did not have their own domestic series, the Gladiators and contenders were hand-picked by Russian TV producers. The Finnish series ceased production after [[International Gladiators 1]].

In 1995, [[Gladiators (Australian TV series)|Australia]] began production of their own show, basing it on the UK series. After the first series, a three part 'Ashes' mini series was filmed in Australia, in which a selection of British and Australian Gladiators faced champions from the opposing countries. Australia then went on to compete in [[International Gladiators 2]] along with the UK and America. Russia also returned, even though they still did not have a domestic series. [[Germany]] and [[South Africa]] also competed even though they too did not have their own domestic series.

===Decline===
After [[International Gladiators 2]], the ''American Gladiators'' series ceased production due to falling ratings, although a live dinner show ran in Florida between 1996 and 1998. The UK and Australia continued to produce their own editions of the show, with the UK continuing to add new events to its roster (retiring some due to safety reasons) with Australia adding events from the UK series in its second and third series.

In 1996, the UK and Australia faced each other again in 'the Ashes 2' this time held in the UK Gladiator arena and an Australia vs. Russia mini series was filmed in Australia with two of the Russian Gladiators who had appeared in International Gladiators 2 appearing alongside new faces. After both of the mini series were filmed and aired, the Australian show was cancelled due to falling ratings, even though plans for a fourth series had commenced, which would include a brand new event that would be exclusive to Australia.

In 1997, South Africa competed against the UK in the Springbok Challenge held in the UK Gladiator arena, despite the fact that they did not have their own domestic series. Only one of the South African Gladiators who appeared in International Gladiators 2 appeared.

In 1999, it was announced that due to falling ratings, the UK series was to be axed. A final mini series in which past champions competed was filmed. It was at this time that South Africa finally began production of [[MTN Gladiators|their own series]] and in 2000, a team of UK Gladiators and contenders went over to film the Springbok Challenge 2, a series filmed exclusively for South African TV only.

===New millennium===
With the South African production in full swing, other territories began producing their own versions. [[Sweden]] began producing their own version in 2000 under the name "''Gladiatorerna''", with the old UK apparatus being shipped over. Short lived series in [[Nigeria]] (2002) and [[Denmark]] (2003) followed.

In 2001, the South African series was overhauled, but it proved unpopular with viewers and the show was axed. Sweden continued to produce ''Gladiators'', creating an event unique to the series, Spidercage, before being axed in 2004.

===The revival===
In August 2007, [[NBC]] confirmed that a revival of ''American Gladiators'' would be produced by [[Reveille Productions]] and [[MGM Television]] to air mid season during early 2008. In addition to events from the original show, the series drew elements from the 1990s UK series as well as being updated for the new millennium in which several events would be played over water. The UK also produced a revival of ''Gladiators''. In September 2007, the [[Seven Network]] in Australia announced that it too was reviving ''Gladiators'', although unlike the American revival, the Australian revival was to follow the lines of its predecessor rather than be overhauled.

The first episode of the new ''[[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' premiered on Sunday 6 January 2008 proving to be a ratings hit. A seconds season was instantly commissioned. At the same time, it was announced that [[Sky One]] were commissioning a [[Gladiators (revival UK TV series)|UK revival]] which would follow the basis set by the American revival.

The [[Gladiators (2008 Australian TV series)|Australian revival]] premiered on 30 March 2008 with the UK series starting on Sunday 11 May. Both revivals proved instant ratings hits for their respective channels. On 12 May 2008, the second season of the American show began, with the series being moved to a bigger arena.

Due to low ratings, the Seven Network placed filming for a second series on hold and released the Gladiators from their holding contracts. NBC similarly have yet to commission a third series due to ratings for the second series being lower than expected.

The [[Gladiators (revival UK TV series)|UK revival]] first aired in August 2008, a second series aired in January 2009. On 20 May 2009, the UK series was axed by the new controller for Sky 1, Stuart Murphy.

The Arab World launched its own version in 2009 featuring Contenders and Gladiators from all over the Arab region. It only lasted one season.

In 2012, the Swedish Gladiators, known as "Gladiatorerna", made a return to television and the revived show has proved very successful with 3 seasons so far filmed and screened, making it the most successful and longest lasting revival of the franchise. In July 2014, it was announced a 4th season would be made. This is due to be screened in early 2015.

In July 2014, Arthur A. Smith company announced plans to bring American Gladiators back again for the third time and were shopping the idea to networks to give it a home.

In August 2018, Actor [[Seth Rogen]] and Evan Goldberg announced plans to bring American Gladiators back again for the fourth time and are shopping the idea to distributors who are interested in the revival.

==Other Ventures==
===Broadband Website===
On January 28, 2008 a broadband website will pay homage to the original series called ''americangladiators.com'' where it features clip of the original which all have been re-digitalized as clips would reintroduce original Gladiators and give fans an update on where they are today. Future segments would also include "Best Hits" and stunts that were performed on the show.

===Tour===
In 2008, MGM, Reveille and Flor-Jon Films Inc. revealed a special ''American Gladiators'' U.S. cross-country tour.

===Cartoon===
MGM along with Johnny Ferraro have put into development a cartoon series based on the show but has never aired.

===Movie===
In 2009, Johnny Ferraro wanted to bring a live-action movie of ''American Gladiators''. Former Legendary Pictures chief marketing officer Scott Mednick was producing the film where the goal was to create an action story that takes place inside the world Ferraro created.

==Format==
In a standard Gladiators show, two female and two male contenders face each other and the Gladiators in anywhere from four to seven events. The line up of events differs across each show with different Gladiators playing the different events dependent on their skill type. Towards the end of the initial UK and American series, the male and female contenders did not necessarily play the same events. Contenders score points for winning against the Gladiators, with the winner having a time advantage in the last event the contenders compete in, the Eliminator.

The winner of the Eliminator goes through to the next round (or wins the series) unless a qualifying time is needed for the next round.

Shows are usually presented by a male and female host (with the exception of all but two seasons of the original American Gladiators, which were presented by two male hosts), as well as a main [[referee]] (often wearing a striped black and white shirt, in the style of an American football referee) presiding over events, handing out disqualifications or red and yellow cards to contenders or Gladiators if needed. A [[timekeeper]] is often present behind the referee but these are not always referred to or provide a speaking role. An unseen commentator will provide play by play accounts (again with the exception of the original American Gladiators series, where the on-screen hosts also provided the play by play)

The show is filmed in front of a live studio audience made up of fans and supporters of the contenders. It is not uncommon for the cameras to focus on particular crowd members or banners. Some incarnations of the show such as the Australian and original UK series have [[cheerleaders]] to provide background entertainment.

==Events==
There have been 35 events involving Gladiators (as well as the Eliminator) across the incarnations. Four of the events have an alternate name in certain territories. A different selection of the events will be played in each episode. No single territory has had all thirty five events on its roster. The UK had the biggest number of events during its initial run with twenty three events.

All events were created by either the American or UK series with the exception of "Soccer Shootout" (South Africa) and "Spidercage" (Sweden). The UK notably adapted some of the American events, with the adaptations becoming the standard design for the concept. For example, the UK version of "Skytrack" would later be adopted by the Australian and American revival series whereas the UK concept of the American event "Tug-o-War" known as "Tilt" eventually superseded Tug-o-War for the 2008 American revival.

Over the course of the original UK and American series, several events were dropped, often due to safety reasons. The Eliminator was the only event which was played in every episode across every territory.

==The Gladiators==
There have been more than 300 Gladiators across all participating territories. Inevitably, there has been some repeat usage of names, and there have been seven instances where the same name has been used twice in a territory for a televised series. The original American Gladiators had two different Gladiators named Lace, and the names Siren and Titan have been used in both the original and revival formats of the American show. The names Amazon, Panther, Siren and Warrior have been used for both the original and revived UK shows. The name Valkyria was used both in the original and revived series in Sweden. The names Panther, Ice, Scorpio, Lightning, Blade, Cyclone, Fierce/Hurja, Flash, Force, Shadow, Thunder, Viper, Nitro, Terminator, Cobra, Rebel, Hurricane, Laser, Phoenix, Destroyer, Rocket, Dynamite (as Miss Dynamite), Bullit as (Bullet) and Delta have been used for both male and female Gladiators.

Most Gladiators come from either a bodybuilding or athletic background. Seven Olympic athletes have competed as Gladiators: Amazon ([[Sharron Davies]]) (UK), Nightshade ([[Judy Simpson]]) (UK), Rebel ([[Jennifer Stoute]]) (UK), Olympia ([[Tatiana Grigorieva]]) (AUS Revival), Hurricane ([[Breaux Greer]]) (US Revival), Predator ([[Du'aine Ladejo]]) (UK Revival) and Battleaxe ([[Shirley Webb]]) (UK Revival).

There have been a few instances where contenders have become Gladiators. Minna Ryynänen, a quarter-finalist from the first series of Finnish Gladiators, returned as Gladiator Safiiri for the next series. UK season 3 and International Gladiators 1 champion Eunice Huthart became Gladiator Blaze. However, Eunice only competed as Blaze in non televised live shows, opting to perform as herself in future televised episodes. Australian series 2 champion and International Gladiators 2 runner up Lourene Bevaart became Glacier, American Gladiators 2008 series 1 champions Monica Carlson and Evan Dollard becoming Jet and Rocket respectively (this was actually mentioned as part of the "prize package" for this season) and after a seven-year gap, Gladiatorerna season 5 winner Patrick Lessa joined the Swedish team for the 2012 revival as Gladiator Baron Samedi.

Only two Gladiators have played for two different domestic series in differing countries; Vulcan ([[John Seru]]) who was originally an Australian Gladiator who transferred to the UK team for Season 7 upon the end of the Australian series and Fox (Tammy Baker) who transferred from the UK to the South African team when the UK series finished. Laser (Tina Andrew), a UK Gladiator went on to compete as Sheena, a member of a South African team for the Springbok Challenge 1. However, she did not compete in the domestic South African series.

Some Gladiators have died since their Gladiator careers ended, including Siren and Hawk from the original American Gladiators, Dynamite and Spartak from Russia, Zeke and Indra from Sweden, Sahara from South Africa, Ninja from Japan and Viking from Finland.

Despite being offered a superpowered item or ability to use in this new world, Kazuma, following some provocation, chooses Aqua herself to accompany him to the town of Axel, quickly finding her absent-mindedness to be less than beneficial.{{ref|LN|LN 1.P}} With Aqua unable to return to the afterlife until the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Devil King]] is defeated, the two form a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] and recruit two other members; an explosion-obsessed magician named Megumin and a masochistic crusader named Darkness.{{ref|LN|LN 1.2.4}} Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a luxurious lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life are forcing him and his party to encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.{{ref|LN|LN 2.3}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=''KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World'' is an anime that has a lot of fun mocking the tropes of the typical JRPG fantasy world via a colorful cast of characters that are enjoyable in their own right. The comedy is so spot-on with its deadpan nature that it's hard not to be drawn in by that alone.|source=– Richard Eisenbeis, in his review of the anime&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review" /&gt;}}

Like its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the "trapped in a fantasy world" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Reviewing the first few episodes, [[Anime News Network]] (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as "the funniest episode of anime I have seen since ''[[Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun]]'' aired", while also praising the series' musical score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episodes-1-2/.97800 |title=KonoSuba – God's blessing on this wonderful world!!

In every scene, his inflection and tone is exactly right to milk the maximum value out of a scene's comedy potential. ...

In contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as "low budget" as characters appeared [[off-model]].&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissy|first=Kim|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/02/27-1/feature-novel-vs-anime-konosuba|title=FEATURE: Novel vs Anime - "Konosuba"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to "bring out the individuality of each character" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed "their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments."&lt;ref name="Interview with Koichi Kikuta"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wavemotioncannon.com/2017/02/07/konosuba-interview-with-koichi-kikuta-anime-style-009-july-2016/|title=Konosuba Interview with Koichi Kikuta (Anime Style 009, July 2016)|work=Wave Motion Cannon|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crunchyroll]]'s Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; [[Kotaku]] writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|url=https://kotaku.com/when-your-new-life-in-a-jrpg-world-doesn-t-live-up-to-e-1778353269|title=When Your New Life in a JRPG World Doesn't Live Up to Expectations|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.&lt;ref name="Creamer review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Nick|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-episodes-1-10-streaming/.100209|title=KonoSuba – God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!

''KonoSuba''{{'s}} characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a "strange but endearing chemistry," as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close.&lt;ref name="Creamer review" /&gt; Morrissy added the party's "emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair."&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite ''KonoSuba'' Character poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sneakerbunko.jp/special/konosuba-charavote/index.php|title=KonoSuba Character Poll|work=[[Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the sixth-highest vote in ''[[Newtype]]''{{'s}} 2015–16 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most "Other" votes in the Best Girl category in [[Crunchyroll]]'s Anime Awards 2016.&lt;ref name="Newtype 2015-16 Awards"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Scott|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/10/09/japanese-fans-pick-favorite-anime-from-last-twelve-months-in-newtype-awards|title=Japanese Fans Pick Favorite Anime From Last Twelve Months In Newtype Awards|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=October 9, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll Awards 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/01/10-1/feature-crunchyroll-anime-awards-the-results-are-in-see-who-won|title=FEATURE: Crunchyroll Anime Awards - The Results are In!

Distributed by [[Pantelion Films]], a major American film distributor for [[Latin America]]n-themed films, the film was shown in the original Spanish-language format with English subtitles.&lt;ref name="univision-chupacabras-us"&gt;{{cite news|title=La leyenda de 'El Chupacabras'|url=http://www.univision.com/entretenimiento/avances/la-leyenda-de-el-chupacabras|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Univision|publisher=Univision Communications Inc.|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving negative reviews, the film is another major box-office success, grossing a total of $100.7 million pesos (US$5.4 million), making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise and currently the only one to surpass the $100 million peso-mark.&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-mexico-box-office"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|title=Fewer Juggernauts Push Mexico to All-Time Box Office Record (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/festivals/fewer-juggernauts-mexico-2016-box-office-record-1202010054/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Variety (magazine)|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC.|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Momias'' voice cast return for the fourth film, Rafael Inclán did not return to voice Alebrije, where he was replaced by dubbing actor Herman López.

===La Leyenda del Charro Negro (2018)===
{{further|La Leyenda del Charro Negro}}
''[[La Leyenda del Charro Negro]]'', the fifth entry, was released on 19 January 2018, as opposed to previous films which were normally released on an October.&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt; It picks up from ''[[La Leyenda del Chupacabras|Chupacabras]]'' where Leo San Juan and his brother Nando head home to [[Puebla City|Puebla]]. Along the way, Leo encounters the 'Charro Negro' ("Black Charro") who confuses him and causes a girl to be cast into the underworld. He enlists the help of his friends to correct his mistakes and take on the 'Charro Negro' once and for all.&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt; ''Charro Negro'' marks the return of some of the past films' characters, such as Don Andrés and Xochitl, while also featuring cameos of other returning characters and references the entire franchise elements.&lt;ref name="proceso-charro-negro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=VÉRTIZ DE LA FUENTE|first1=COLUMBA|title="La leyenda del Charro Negro" en cines|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/519861/la-leyenda-del-charro-negro-en-cines|accessdate=27 January 2018|work=Proceso (magazine)|publisher=Proceso Comunicación e Información S.A. de C.V.|date=24 January 2018}} In Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="charro-eluniversal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortiz|first1=Cesar Huerta|title=Alistan "La Leyenda del Charro Negro"|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/espectaculos/cine/2017/06/8/alistan-la-leyenda-del-charro-negro|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=El Universal|publisher=El Universal|date=6 August 2017}} In Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the returning voice cast of the ''Momias'' and ''Chupacabras'', Mexican actor [[Erick Elías]] voices the 'Charro Negro'.&lt;ref name="charronegro-queretaro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosa Camacho|first1=Alma|last2=Lopez|first2=Adolfo|title=Se estrena la cinta La leyenda del Charro Negro|url=https://www.diariodequeretaro.com.mx/gossip/celebridades/se-estrena-la-cinta-la-leyenda-del-charro-negro-563863.html|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=Diario de Queretaro|publisher=Editorial Organization Mexicana|date=16 January 2018}} In Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels and future of franchise===
While ''Charro Negro'' has been rumored to be the last film in the franchise, director Alberto Rodríguez has stated the possibility of a new film, due to the amount of potential and "many more doors to explore", but would require the creation of new characters.&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"&gt;{{cite news|title=EL CHARRO NEGRO, ¿LA ÚLTIMA LEYENDA?|url=https://videocine.com.mx/noticia/charro-negro-la-ultima-leyenda/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Videocine Distrbucion Noticas|publisher=Televisa, S.A. de C.V.|date=2018}} In Spanish. (Note: date not shown on website)&lt;/ref&gt;
Andrés Couturier, the voice of Don Andrés and manager at [[Ánima Estudios]], said that he wouldn't be "surprised to see crossovers or spin-offs of ''Las Leyendas''."&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"/&gt; Rodríguez stated that ''Charro Negro'' would be his last film, as he has expressed interest in making new projects outside of the franchise. "I feel that my cycle is already finished in terms of [''Leyendas'']. I already want to do other things, but we are still involved in the development of other things that come for the ''Leyendas''," he said.&lt;ref name="proceso-charro-negro"/&gt;

It was announced on [[Twitter]] that another installment is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cinepolis on Twitter: "¡Algo nuevo de @helloanima se está cocinando! Sigue al pendiente para descubrir nuevas noticias...." |url=https://twitter.com/Cinepolis/status/1062051492847267841 |website=Twitter |publisher=Cinepolis |accessdate=12 November 2018}} In Spanish. Date published: 12 November 2018. 10:36am.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently unknown whether the film will be a direct follow-up to Leo's past adventures or an entirely new film.

==Gameplay==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
The player controls up to 4 units on the field at one time including the player's avatar and up to 90 total cost of units at one time.  When a unit dies it must be returned to the inactive area and after a set amount of time it can be used again.  Active units can only be switched in and out while the players units are in the gate area.  Players can damage enemy arcane crystals, the search eye, the crystal shield or gates by putting their units in the associated area as long as no enemies are present.  Players can also damage the arcane crystals by destroying all of the opponents units that are on the field.

==Story==
In ancient times, before the creation of the worlds, there lived a God. He opened his heart and brought forth a vermilion stone in order to create seven different worlds. Whosoever held the vermilion stone held the power to create worlds, and would reign over the seven worlds as a god, the "Lord of Vermilion". The seven worlds existed side by side in harmony for millennia, their inhabitants separated by boundaries and unable to interfere with one another... until the "Great Collapse".

The lord of the human world, consumed by ambition, sought to use the forbidden magic of the vermilion stone, called the "Arcana", in order to become a god. However, he was unable to wield the power and the Arcana was shattered into seven pieces and scattered amongst the seven worlds, destroying their boundaries. The six worlds were drawn into the human world and they merged. With the six races of the six worlds thrust into the human world, chaos and war broke out.

Ages later, the world, called the "Land of Acheron", is still in turmoil. The six "Lords" of the six races sow strife across the land, warring for each other's Arcana. The player takes the role of a legendary warrior who holds the seventh Arcana and seeks to obtain the Arcana and upset the balance of the world, gathering an army of "Familiars" who hold faith in the legend of the "Lord of Vermilion".

==Characters==
[[File:Lord of Vermilion videogame - Taito Station.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A gamer plays Lord of Vermilion video game on arcade. (Shibuya – Tokyo, Taito Station)]]

*'''Player Character''': The player character is one of the few humans to survive the Great Collapse, and can be customized by the player. A legendary warrior with mysterious origins, the player seeks to use the power of Arcana, "Miracle", to reshape the world and return harmony to the land, and as such gathers an army of faithful followers in order to wage war on the six "Lords" and become the "Lord of Vermilion". There are two characters which the player may select from: the male {{nihongo|Nido|ニド}}, or the female {{nihongo|Rishia|リシア}}. They each have similar backstories and roles within the story mode.
*'''Dux''': A mysterious knight completely clad in heavy armor, which completely conceals their identity and gender, who first appears in the tutorial and holds extensive knowledge on Arcana and the world. Dux is later revealed to be a former friend of the player's deceased father who agreed to watch over the player several years earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4195">'''Media monitoring''' is the activity of monitoring the output of the print, online and broadcast media.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It can be conducted for a variety of reasons, including political, commercial, scientific, and so on.

==In business==
In the commercial sphere, this activity is usually carried out in house or by a [[media monitoring service]], a private company that provides such services to other companies, organisations and individuals on a [[subscription]] basis.

The services that media monitoring companies provide typically include the systematic recording of radio and television broadcasts, the collection of press clippings from print media publications,  the collection of data from online information sources. The material collected usually consists of any media output that makes reference to the client, its activities and/or its designated topics of interests. The monitoring of online consumer sources such as [[blogs]], [[Internet forum|forums]] and [[social networks]] is more specifically known as [[buzz monitoring]] which informs the company of how its service or product is perceived by users.

While monitoring social media it can be beneficial for a company to respond to as many posts as possible.  Not all comments will be positive ones, but it is good for the customers to know they are being heard.  It is also important to keep in mind to avoid deleting any unfavorable content from a social media page you control.  You should assume that something on the Internet was seen by at least one person, no matter how quickly you delete it.  Deleting the comment can make the company look even worse and give the idea of a cover-up which implies guilt on the company’s part.

Most media monitoring is done within private public relations agencies or businesses in house public relations sectors. Publicists will track the number of times the company was mentioned within different platforms.  Some of the main platforms include magazines, newspaper, blogs, and social media.  These entries are referred to as “clippings” and are compiled into monthly reports by the Public Relations firm.  These clippings are then presented to the client along with the circulation and impressions from these platforms.  Circulation is how many subscribers or viewers the platform has, and impressions are calculated by multiplying the circulation by three.  Impressions are only calculated for print media because it is assumed print media will be circulated past the original subscribers.  These figures are calculated to show the client approximately how many people their message has reached.  Media monitoring is a beneficial tool to evaluate the efforts and progress of a PR firm.

==In social sciences==
In academia media monitoring is deployed by social scientists in an attempt to discover e.g. biases in the way the same event is presented in different media, among the media of different countries etc. The use of large scale monitoring techniques by computer scientists enabled the exploration of different aspects of the media system such as the visualisation of the media-sphere,&lt;ref&gt;I. Flaounas, M. Turchi, T. De Bie, and N. Cristianini,  "Inference and Validation of Networks",  ECML/PKDD, Bled, Slovenia, Springer, pp. 344–358, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the sentimental and objectivity analysis of news content&lt;ref&gt;N. Godbole,M. Srinivasaiah, S. Skiena, "Large-Scale Sentiment Analysis for News and Blogs", Int. Conf. on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2007), Denver CO, March 26–28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==Technologies involved==
Media monitoring is practically achieved by a combination of technologies—including audio and video recording, [[text mining|high speed text scanners and text recognition software]]—and human readers and analysts. The automation of the process is highly desirable and can be partially achieved by deploying [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] techniques.

[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|Theatrical poster for a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
'''Mentalism''' is a performing art in which its practitioners, known as '''mentalists''', appear to demonstrate highly developed mental or intuitive abilities. Performances may appear to include [[hypnosis]], [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[divination]], [[precognition]], [[psychokinesis]], [[mediumship]], [[mind control]], memory feats, deduction, and rapid mathematics. Mentalists are sometimes categorized as [[psychic]] entertainers, although that category also contains non-mentalist performers such as psychic readers and [[Bizarre magic|bizzarists]].

==Background==
Much of what modern mentalists perform in their acts can be traced back directly to "tests" of supernatural power that were carried out by mediums, [[spiritualist]]s, and [[psychic]]s in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Bob: "Fundamentals of Professional Mentalism". Lybrary, 2007. pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the history of mentalism goes back even further. Accounts of [[Clairvoyance|seer]]s and [[oracle]]s can be found in works by the [[ancient Greeks]]{{Attribution needed|date=September 2011}} and in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]]. Among magicians, the mentalism performance generally cited as one of the earliest on record was by diplomat and pioneering [[sleight of hand|sleight-of-hand]] magician [[Girolamo Scotto]] in 1572.  The performance of mentalism may utilize these principles along with sleights, feints, [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], and other skills of street or [[magic (illusion)|stage magic]].&lt;ref name=EncycClaims&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/mentalist.html | title=An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=1995 | first=James | last=Randi | accessdate = 2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance approaches==
Styles of presentation can vary greatly. Traditional performers such as [[Dunninger]] and [[Theodore Annemann|Annemann]] attributed their results to supernatural or psychic skills.

Some contemporary performers, such as [[Derren Brown]], attribute their results to natural skills, such as the ability to read [[body language]] or to manipulate the subject subliminally through psychological suggestion.

Others, including [[Chan Canasta]] and [[David Berglas]] would make no specific claims but leave it up to the audience to decide.

Contemporary mentalists often take their shows onto the streets and perform tricks to a live, unsuspecting audience. They do this by approaching random members of the public and ask to demonstrate their supernatural powers. Performers such as [[Derren Brown]] who often adopt this method of performance tell their audience before the trick starts that everything they see is an illusion and that they are not really "having their mind read." This has been the cause of a lot of controversy in the sphere of magic as some mentalists want their audience to believe that this type of magic is 'real' whilst others think that it is morally wrong to lie to a spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sorcerers-apprentice.co.uk/karma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426185334/http://www.sorcerers-apprentice.co.uk/karma.htm |archivedate=2015-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mentalist or magician==
Mentalists generally do not mix "standard" magic tricks with their mental feats. Doing so associates mentalism too closely with the theatrical trickery employed by stage magicians. Many mentalists claim not to be magicians at all, arguing that it is a different art form altogether. The argument is that mentalism invokes belief and when presented properly, is offered as being "real" be it a claim of psychic ability, or proof that supports other claims such as a photographic memory, being a "human calculator", the power of suggestion, [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]], etc.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  Mentalism plays on the senses and a spectator's perception of tricks.

Magicians ask the audience to suspend their disbelief and allow their imagination to play with the various tricks they present. They admit that they are tricksters and entertainers, and know the audience understands it's an illusion and the magician cannot really achieve the impossible feats shown, such as sawing a person in half and putting them back together without injury.

However, many magicians mix mentally-themed performance with magic illusions. For example, a mind-reading stunt might also involve the magical transposition of two different objects. Such hybrid feats of [[Stage magic|magic]] are often called ''mental magic'' by performers. Magicians who routinely mix magic with mental magic include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[David Blaine]], [[The Amazing Kreskin]], and [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.  Notable mentalists who mix magic with mentalism include [[The Amazing Kreskin]], [[Richard Osterlind]], [[David Berglas]], [[Derren Brown]], and [[Joseph Dunninger]].

'''Motion-capture acting''', also called '''performance-capture acting''', sometimes abbreviated as '''MoCap''' or '''Pcap''', is a type of [[acting]] in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit&lt;ref&gt; NY Castings, Joe Gatt, [http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors Motion Capture Actors: Body Movement Tells the Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703113656/http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors |date=2014-07-03 }}, Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or directly on the skin.&lt;ref name=twsWired&gt; Hugh Hart, January 24, 2012, Wired magazine, [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/andy-serkis-oscars/ When will a motion capture actor win an Oscar?], Accessed June 21, 2014, "...the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ historic reluctance to honor motion-capture performances ....."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCalgaryHerald&gt; January 25, 2012, Calgary Herald, [http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/01/25/no-oscar-nod-for-andy-serkis-master-of-stop-motion-acting/ No Oscar nod for Andy Serkis: master of motion-capture acting], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Serkis has carved out a niche for himself as master of motion-capture roles..."&lt;/ref&gt; Several cameras from different angles record the actor's movements simultaneously, recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor. Sampling is done many times each second, aided by advances in computer technology. The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting, such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air. This type of acting is seen as a growth area, with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage"&gt;Andrew Harris Salomon, Feb. 22, 2013, Backstage Magazine, [http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/growth-performance-capture-helping-gaming-actors-weather-slump/ Growth In Performance Capture Helping Gaming Actors Weather Slump], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..motion-capture technology ... indicate that this niche continues to be a growth area for actors...."&lt;/ref&gt; Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage" /&gt;

Motion-capture acting can be difficult work. For example, one actor was "placed in a tiny booth, had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements, and had to sit perfectly still".&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting.&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; It is a new type of acting work. Numerous sources identify actor [[Andy Serkis]] as the "king of motion-capture acting" based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref name=twsToday&gt; Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, TODAY, May 26, 2014, [http://www.today.com/entertainment/7-summer-movies-you-shouldnt-miss-2D79591396 7 summer movies you shouldn't miss], Accessed June 21, 2014, "....Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture acting..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLATimes&gt;Gina McIntyre, June 04, 2014, Los Angeles Times, [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-wars-josh-trank-set-to-direct-standalone-film/#/0 ‘Star Wars’: Josh Trank set to direct standalone film], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, performance capture expert Andy Serkis ..."&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'' which starred Serkis and others.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt; [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/performance-capture-injects-emotion-into-virtual-worlds-1.1104828 Performance capture injects emotion into virtual worlds: Using actors' movements, expressions to animate digital characters in games, film allows audiences to relate], March 7, 2011, Blaine Kyllo, "...Heavenly Sword (2007), which starred Serkis and Anna Torv (Fringe ), was the first video game in which performance capture was used..."&lt;/ref&gt; Serkis said:

There have been battles within the film industry about earning recognition for motion-capture actors. The Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers does not consider motion-capture acting as the same type of work as acting, which means that motion-capture actors are often paid less.&lt;ref name=twsVariety/&gt; The [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) has lobbied the industry for better employment terms and conditions for motion-capture actors, and argued that motion-capture work should be included in standard labor contracts.&lt;ref name=twsVariety&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..The Screen Actors Guild ... are the characters in these films ... performing as genuine actors or something else?..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The industry in 2012 did not give awards for motion-capture acting.&lt;ref name=twsHollywood&gt; KELSEA STAHLER, DEC 07, 2012, Hollywood.com, [http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/45718147/andy-serkis-at-the-hobbit-premiere-gollum-motion-capture-acting-is-just-acting?page=all Andy Serkis at ‘The Hobbit’ Premiere: Gollum Motion Capture Acting Is ‘Just Acting’], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Some film experts have had trouble categorizing the master motion capture actor, The Hobbit star Andy Serkis, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimodal anthropology''' is an emerging subfield of social [[cultural anthropology]] that encompasses anthropological research and knowledge production across multiple traditional and new media platforms and practices including [[film]], [[video]], [[photography]], theatre, design, [[podcast]], mobile apps, interactive games, web-based social networking, immersive [[360-degree video|360 video]] and [[augmented reality]]. As characterized in [[American Anthropologist]]'','' multimodal anthropology is an "anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms" (Collins, Durington &amp; Gill).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Samuel Gerald|last2=Durington|first2=Matthew|last3=Gill|first3=Harjant|date=2017-01-12|title=Multimodality: An Invitation|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=142–146|doi=10.1111/aman.12826|issn=0002-7294}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimodal approach also encourages [[anthropologist]] to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.

== History and background ==
Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and [[Field research|fieldwork]] from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the [[20th century|twentieth century]] whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as [[psychotherapy]], [[phonetics]], [[genetics]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]] to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media.

Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to [[photography]], [[film]] cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of [[visual anthropology]] as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of [[21st century|twenty-first century]] including mobile networking, [[social media]], [[Geotagging|geo-mapping]], [[virtual reality]], [[Podcast|podcasting]], [[interactive design]], along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within [[visual anthropology]], such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and [[Harjant Gill]] note in their introductory essay on title "Multimodality: An Invitation," published in [[American Anthropologist]], "multimodal anthropologies does not attempt – or desire – to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of [[visual anthropology]] while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''narrative environment''' is a space, whether physical or [[Virtuality|virtual]], in which stories can unfold.  A virtual [[narrative]] environment might be the narrative framework in which game play can proceed. A physical narrative environment might be an exhibition area within a museum, or a foyer of a retail space, or the public spaces around a building - anywhere in short where stories can be told in space. It is also a term coined by the [[Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design]] program in Narrative Whitby{{what?|date=January 2014}}, where the first Narrative Environment course was introduced in 2003. It is a full-time, 2 year Masters level course leading to an MA degree in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">A '''narrative hook''' (or just '''hook''') is a [[literary technique]] in the opening of a story that "hooks" the reader's attention so that he or she will keep on reading. The "opening" may consist of several paragraphs for a short story, or several pages for a novel, but ideally it is the [[opening sentence]] in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Examples ==
One of the most common forms is dramatic action, which engages the reader into wondering what the consequences of the action will be.{{Example needed}}  This particular form has been recommended from the earliest days, stemming from [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]].{{Example needed}}

The use of action as the hook, and the advice to so use it, is so widespread as to sometimes lead to the use of the term to mean an action opening, but other things can be used for narrative hooks, such mysterious settings, or engaging characters, or even a thematic statement, as with [[Jane Austen]]'s opening line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')

When a story does not lend itself to a good hook when it is laid out linearly, the writer may tell the story out of order to engage the reader's interest.  The story may begin with a dramatic moment and, once the reader is curious, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the history necessary to understand it.  Or it may be told as a [[story-within-a-story]], with the narrator in the [[frame story]] telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand latter actions. A famous early example of this technique was used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', in which the frame story consists of [[Sheherazade]] telling stories to King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|Shahriyar]]; she must keep him 'hooked' to each of the stories, in order to prevent him from executing her the next morning.

=== ''In medias res'' ===
''[[In medias res]]'' is where the relating of a story begins at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=Tim|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of story telling might be used as a narrative hook. Narrative hooks often play an important role in [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thrillers]] and [[mystery fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Treat, America | year = 1982 | title = Mystery Writer's Handbook | publisher = Writer's Digest Books | page = 111 | isbn= 0898790808}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of both these occurrences is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which a tale, "[[The Three Apples]]," begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body, thus keeping the reader interested in "[[whodunit]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Coffee Park''' ({{lang|es|Parque Nacional del Café}}) is a [[theme park]] located in the department of [[Quindío Department|Quindío]], [[Colombia]], 4&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the town of [[Montenegro, Colombia|Montenegro]] and 11&amp;nbsp;km west of the departmental capital city [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]. The park was founded by the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]] ({{lang|es|La Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia}}) and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío ({{lang|es|El Comité Departamental de Cafeteros del Quindío}}), and opened on 24 February 1995.&lt;ref name="Dinero20180322"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Parque del Café invierte más de $27.000 millones en nueva montaña rusa y teleférico |url=https://www.dinero.com/empresas/articulo/nuevas-atracciones-del-parque-del-cafe-en-quindio/256626 |magazine=[[Dinero (magazine)|Dinero]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronica20180322"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Parque del Café inauguró Yippe, su nueva montaña rusa |url=https://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-parque-del-cafe-inauguro-yippe-su-nueva-montana-rusa-nota-118966 |newspaper=[[La Crónica del Quindío]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two main areas: by the main entrance are the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions detailing the history, culture and process of growing and producing coffee in the region; and in the valley beyond is an [[amusement park]] with [[Amusement ride|rides]] and shows. The two areas are linked by two [[gondola lift]]s and a [[chairlift]]: it is also possible to walk between the two areas via an ecological trail that passes through a plantation of many varieties of [[Coffea|coffee bushes]].

As well as amusement rides the park also offers other attractions such as [[animatronics]] shows, a global coffee garden, food stalls based on [[coffee]] and traditional Colombian architecture.

==History==
The idea for a coffee museum came after Diego Arango Mora and his wife Margarita visited the Sugar Museum in nearby [[Valle del Cauca Department]]. Margarita remarked that if the country had a museum dedicated to sugar, it should also have one dedicated to Colombia's best known export. Arango, a member of the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío, agreed and contacted Jorge Cárdenas Gutiérrez, the head of the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]], who was also receptive to the idea. When Arango was elected to chair the National Congress of Coffee Growers in 1982, he  proposed the creation of the museum, but was told by the secretary of the Congress that he did not have the quorum to pass the proposal.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302"&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Revelamos 23 microhistorias del Parque Nacional del Café (parte I) |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-revelamos_23_microhistorias_del_parque_nacional_del_caf_parte_i-seccion-la_regin-nota-85641 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, Arango continued to work toward the creation of the museum, despite lack of financial support from banks unwilling to lend money for an enterprise they saw as non-profitable, and opposition from delegates from three other departments of Colombia who lobbied for the museum to be constructed in their departments, as well from other towns within the department of Quindío itself who objected to Arango's choice of Montenegro as the planned site for the museum.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt;

The museum was finally constructed and opened on 24 February 1995, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first year. However, visitor surveys showed that it was mainly those of 40 years of age who enjoyed the park, while younger visitors and children indicated they would not return. Arango took the decision to add an amusement park to the museum in order to attract the younger crowds.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt; The first attractions were the gondola lift and the steam railway, followed by the roller coaster and other rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Un terremoto y muchas intrigas casi matan al parque del Café |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-un_terremoto_y_muchas_intrigas_casi_matan_al_parque_del_caf-seccion-la_general-nota-85654 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nightlife in Bangkok''' had a reputation in the past for having an element of rowdiness. Besides being the capital of [[Thailand]], Bangkok has been recently reported as having a historic drop in its crime rate.&lt;ref name="thailandnews"&gt;[http://www.thailandnews.co/2011/03/thai-pm-crime-rate-in-bangkok-down-20-per-cent-as-promised/ Thai PM: Crime rate in Bangkok down 20% as promised] at Thailand News&lt;/ref&gt; Bangkok's crime fighting program will eventually be adopted by Bangkok's neighboring cities and communities in the near future.&lt;ref name="thailandnews"/&gt;

On weekdays, most of Bangkok's nightlife takes places in the Red Light Districts of [[Soi Cowboy]] and [[Nana Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bangkok-nightlife.com/bkk-nightlife-guide/|title=Bangkok Nightlife Guide|last=|first=|date=|work=Bangkok-Nightlife.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most venues outside of those areas are only open on weekends. [[Khaosan Road]] is another popular nightlife spot in Bangkok with mostly young backpackers roaming the streets.

==Overview==
It has been mentioned in popular culture in [[Murray Head]]'s song ''[[One Night in Bangkok]]'' with the infamous quote "One night in Bangkok can make a hard man humble." While the choruses extol [[Bangkok]]'s reputation and exciting atmosphere in the song, the American in the music video would denounce the city, including its [[red-light district]], "[[Chao Phraya River|muddy old river]]" and "[[Wat Pho|reclining Buddha]]". Bangkok is also well known for their [[massage parlor]]s and the popular ''Eden Club''; which offers "professional sexual services".&lt;ref name="comparison"&gt;[http://www.mypattaya.com/155pattayabangkok.asp Pattaya vs Bangkok (Nightlife Comparison)] at MyPattaya.com&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few rules of the Eden Club is to take two ladies that are equally skilled in pleasuring each other as the male client.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stickmanbangkok.com/Reader/reader1303.htm Basic information about the ''Eden Club''] at StickManBangkok.com&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried males can find [[sexual intercourse|sexual]] companionship amongst the local [[prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;

[[Bangkok]] has also been discovered to be one of the safest and relaxed cities in the world.&lt;ref name="bangkok"&gt;[http://www.bangkok.com/nightlife/ Bangkok Nightlife - What to Do &amp; Where to Go at Night in Bangkok]&lt;/ref&gt; Their nightlife ranges from live music in [[jazz club]]s to world-class [[restaurant]]s.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; The once sleazy image of Bangkok at night has been virtually eradicated in the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; Bangkok is the only place in the world with [[pink]] taxi cabs that cater towards the [[LGBT]] tourists and residents.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; Even unescorted [[women]] can enjoy Bangkok safely and without any problems.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; Each bar has a different show of girls and [[bar game]]s and a variety of [[stereo]]s competing for the attentions of the patrons.&lt;ref name="pattaya"&gt;[http://www.pattaya.bangkok.com/nightlife/ Pattaya Nightlife - What to Do at Night in Pattaya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cabaret]] shows in Bangkok have a tendency to feature [[transgender]] performers.&lt;ref name="pattaya"/&gt; Drug violations are often handed out more severe penalties than in the [[Western world]] and [[statutory rape]] is completely frowned upon.&lt;ref name="gaynightlife"&gt;[http://www.bangkok.com/nightlife-gay-nightlife/ Bangkok Gay Nightlife]&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of [[Beer in Thailand|domestic beer]] in Bangkok ranges from $1.44 USD to $2.87 USD while the cost of imported beer ranges from $1.92 USD to $4.79 USD.&lt;ref name="costofliving"&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Thailand&amp;city=Bangkok&amp;displayCurrency=USD Cost of living in Bangkok, Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; The price of taxi service for a 1-kilometer drive ranges from $0.13 USD to $0.18 USD.&lt;ref name="costofliving"/&gt; Due to the lower prices for alcoholic beverages as opposed to the major cities of North America and Europe, the majority of the customers are the local students who are attending university.&lt;ref name="gaynightlife"/&gt; The [[Lamsalee]] sub-district caters more to the local crowds than international tourists; with their dance clubs catering towards their regular stream of customers.&lt;ref name="gaynightlife"/&gt; Tourists are more likely to head towards the [[Si Lom]] sub-district (with Soi 2 being more for the young adult crowd with nightclubs playing [[dance music]] and Soi 4 being more easy-going with a variety of restaurants and places to drink alcohol).&lt;ref name="gaynightlife"/&gt;

==Ladyboy shows==
Thailand is famous for its racy nightlife entertainment and amongst the madness is a thriving cabaret scene. Every night tourists pack into the various venues for an entertaining show that is full of laughs, music and dance. In Thailand the top shows include Calypso Cabaret, Simon Phuket, Tiffany's and popular newcomers Playhouse Theater.

Thailand is one of the most well-recognized centers of transgender and transvestite performance artists in the world. They are known as either ''[[kathoey]]s'' or "ladyboys.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"&gt;[http://www.bangkok.com/nightlife-ladyboy-shows/ Ladyboy Shows]&lt;/ref&gt;" In fact, it is the most cost-effective place to acquire [[sex reassignment surgery]] along with having the highest standards of surgeons trained in performing operations of this kind.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"/&gt; Most of these performs already had [[breast implant]]s and typically perform before completely transitioning into womanhood by undergoing surgery on their genitals.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"/&gt; All sorts of feminine legends are celebrated here from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] divas to legendary female [[disco]] artists and even [[legendary creature|mythical creatures]]s from Thailand's glorious past.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"/&gt; These transgender people are accepted even in rural Thailand.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"/&gt; However, their genders are not legally recognized and [[suicide]] rates amongst ladyboy show performers are higher than the national average.&lt;ref name="ladyboy"/&gt;

[[File:Joke - phone books in doorway.jpg|thumb|upright|Practical joke involving completely blocking someone's doorway with [[phone book]]s]]

A '''practical joke''', or '''prank''', is a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{ cite web| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/practical%20joke?fromAsk=true&amp;o=100074 |title= Practical joke|publisher = Dictionary.com|accessdate= 2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"&gt;Marsh, Moira. 2015. ''Practically Joking''. Logan: Utah State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-87421-983-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who performs a practical joke is called a "practical joker".&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt; Other terms for practical jokes include '''gag''', '''jape''', or '''shenanigan'''.

Practical jokes differ from [[confidence trick]]s or [[hoax]]es in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes are generally lighthearted and without lasting impact; they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish, but not victimized or [[humiliation | humiliated]]. Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to encourage [[laughter]]. However, practical jokes performed with [[cruelty]] can constitute [[bullying]], whose intent is to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Relational Rituals and Communication: Ritual Interaction in Groups|page= 156

|first= Dániel Z.|last= Kádár|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries in [[Western culture]] traditionally emphasize the carrying out of practical jokes on [[April Fools' Day]].&lt;ref name=EconJape&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

A practical joke is "practical" because it consists of someone doing something physical, in contrast to a verbal or written joke. For example, the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a [[door]]way and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. [[practical joke device|Objects]] can also be used in practical jokes, like [[fake vomit]], [[chewing gum bug]]s, [[exploding cigar]]s, [[stink bomb]]s, [[costume]]s and [[whoopee cushion]]s.

Practical jokes often occur inside [[office]]s, usually to surprise co-workers. Covering the computer accessories with Jell-O, wrapping the desk with Christmas paper or aluminium foil or filling it with balloons are just some examples of office pranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.weirdomatic.com/funny-office-pranks.html |title=Funny Office Pranks|publisher =Weirdomatic.com|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical jokes are also common occurrences during [[sleepover]]s, whereby teens will play pranks on their friends as they come into the home, enter a room or even as they sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.terrysblinds.co.uk/infographics/10-pranks-to-play-on-friends/ |title=Funny Sleepover Pranks|publisher =Terrysblinds.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American humorist [[H. Allen Smith]] wrote a 320-page book in 1953 called ''The Compleat Practical Joker'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03705-4}}) that contains numerous examples of practical jokes. The book became a best seller not only in the United States but also in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|magazine=Publishers Weekly|volume=209|page=2:24
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAtFAQAAIAAJ
|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Marsh has written an entire volume about practical jokes.&lt;ref name="Marsh, Moira 2015"/&gt; One of her findings is that in the USA they are more often done by males than females.

== Famous examples ==

A practical joke recalled as his favorite by the [[playwright]] [[Charles MacArthur]], concerns the American painter and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] character [[Waldo Peirce]]. While living in [[Paris]] in the 1920s, Peirce "made a gift of a very big [[turtle]] to the woman who was the [[concierge]] of his building". The woman doted on the turtle and lavished care on it. A few days later Peirce substituted a somewhat larger turtle for the original one. This continued for some time, with larger and larger turtles being surreptitiously introduced into the woman's apartment. The concierge was beside herself with happiness and displayed her miraculous turtle to the entire neighborhood. Peirce then began to sneak in and replace the turtle with smaller and smaller ones, to her bewildered distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fun Fare: a Treasury of Reader's Digest Wit and Humor|page=36

Modern and successful pranks often take advantage of the modernization of tools and techniques. In Canada, engineering students have a reputation for annual pranks; at the [[University of British Columbia]] these usually involve leaving a Volkswagen Beetle in an unexpected location (such as suspended from the Golden Gate Bridge&lt;ref&gt;Curiel, Jonathan. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-02-05/news/17584547_1_golden-gate-bridge-british-columbia-engineering-students "Beetle Overboard! / VW hung off GG Bridge in prank"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 5, 2001, accessed March 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lions Gate Bridge&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Graeme.

A similar prank was undertaken by engineering students at [[Cambridge University]], England, where an [[Austin 7]] car was put on top of the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]] building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5323412 From Hermes to bonsai kittens.

Not unlike the [[Stone Louse]] of Germany, in the American West the [[jackalope]] has become an institutionalized practical joke perennially perpetrated by ruralites (as a class) on [[tourism|tourists]], most of whom have never heard of the decades-old myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Deception|page=555

The 2003 TV movie ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', consists of an elaborate practical joke on the film's star, Perry Caravallo, who is led to believe that he is starring in a faux action film, ''Windy City Heat'', where the filming which is ostensibly for the film's DVD extras actually documents the long chain of pranks and jokes performed at Caravallo's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Grantland|title=The Greatest Trick Comedy Ever Pulled|date=2013-11-12|first=Steven|last=Hyden|url=http://grantland.com/features/windy-city-heat-10-years-later-history-comedy-store/|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pull my finger''' is a [[joke]] or [[prank]] regarding [[flatulence]] in which a [[Mark (victim)|mark]] is asked to pull the finger of the joker, who simultaneously farts so as to suggest a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the two events. 

A comparable activity is attributed to a character in a short story by [[Mordecai Richler]] (collected in ''[[The Street (story collection)|The Street]]'', 1969):
{{cquote|He settled in sullenly at the kitchen table, his smile morose, and suddenly he would call out, "Pull my finger!" If you did he let out a tremendous burp.}}

A variation on this joke appears in [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s film ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' ([[1959 in film|1959]]). Schoolboys ask each other to push their foreheads, responding with an expulsion of gas.

In the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', a gas bomb hidden in a corpse has its timer started by pulling on the corpse's finger.

In 2008, an [[iPhone]] app from Air-O-Matic called Pull My Finger was one of the most popular apps in Apple's App Store, purchased over 50,000 times in less than one week.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It allowed users to pull a virtual finger, activating the sound.  The phrase is now the focus of a legal battle between Pull My Finger and InfoMedia's iFart Mobile app over the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chartier |first=David |url=https://arstechnica.com/software/news/2009/02/prior-fart-legal-stink-up-over-iphone-flatulence-apps.ars |title=Prior fart: legal stink-up over iPhone flatulence apps |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an MRI study of how knuckles trigger popping sounds was jokingly called the "pull my finger study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/health/pop-science-study-reveals-secret-behind-knuckle-cracking-sound-t15401 |title='Pull my finger': Study reveals secret behind knuckle-cracking pop|publisher=today.com |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikolai Zykov with hand puppets, Russia.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer with hand puppets.]]
A '''puppeteer''' is a person who manipulates an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal or mythical creature, or another object to create the illusion that the [[puppet]] is "alive". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs. Some puppet styles require two or more puppeteers to work together to create a single puppet character.

The puppeteer's role is to manipulate the physical object in such a manner that the audience believes the object is imbued with life. In some instances, the persona of the puppeteer is also an important feature, as with [[ventriloquist's dummy]] performers, in which the puppeteer and the human figure-styled puppet appear onstage together, and in theatre shows like ''[[Avenue Q]]''.

The puppeteer might speak in the role of the puppet's character, synchronising the movements of the puppet's "mouth". However, there is much puppetry which does not use the moving mouth (which is a lip-sync innovation created originally for television where close-up "headshots" are popular). Often, in theatre, a moveable mouth is used only for gestural expression, or speech might be produced by a non-moving mouth. In traditional glove puppetry often one puppeteer will operate two puppets at a time out of a cast of several.
Much work is produced without any speech at all with all the emphasis on movement

The relationship between the puppeteer and the puppet-maker is similar to that between an [[actor]] and a [[playwright]], in cases where a puppet-maker designs a puppet for a puppeteer. Very often, though, the puppeteer assumes the joint roles of puppet-maker, [[Theatre director|director]], [[designer]], writer and [[performer]]. In this case a puppeteer is a more complete theatre practitioner than is the case with other theatre forms, in which one person writes a play, another person directs it, and then [[actor]]s perform the lines and gestures.

Puppetry is a complex medium sometimes consisting of live performance, sometimes contributing to stop frame puppet animation, and film where performances might be technically processed as motion capture, CGI or as virtual puppetry.

Musicians often have a [[musical repertoire]]. The first known use of the word "repertoire" was in 1847.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; It is a [[loan word]] from the [[French language]], as "répertoire", with a similar meaning in the arts. The origin of the word is from the [[Late Latin]] word "repertorium".&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

The concept of a basic repertoire has been extended to refer to groups which focus mainly on performing standard works, as in [[repertory theater]] or repertoire [[ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;

In general, '''spectacle''' refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in [[Middle English]] from c. 1340 as "specially prepared or arranged display" it was borrowed from [[Old French]] ''spectacle'', itself a reflection of the [[Latin]] ''spectaculum'' "a show" from ''spectare'' "to view, watch" frequentative form of ''specere'' "to look at."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spectacle&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''spectacle'' has also been a [[term of art]] in theater dating from the 17th century in English [[drama]].
==The masque and spectacle==
Court [[masque]]s and masques of the nobility were most popular in the [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] era.  Such masques, as their name implies, relied heavily upon a non-verbal theater.  The character lists for masques would be quite small, in keeping with the ability of a small family of patrons to act, but the [[costume]]s and theatrical effects would be lavish.  Reading the text of masques, such as ''The Masque at Ludlow'' (most often referred to as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''), the writing is spare, philosophical, and grandiose, with very few marks of traditional dramatic structure.  This is partially due to the purpose of the masque being family entertainment and spectacle.  Unlike ''The Masque at Ludlow'', most masques were recreations of well-known mythological or religious scenes.  Some masques would derive from tableau.  For example, [[Edmund Spenser]] (''Fairie Queene'' I, iv) describes a masque of ''The [[Seven Deadly Sins]]''.  

Masques were [[multimedia]], for they almost always involved costuming and music as a method of conveying the story or narrative.  [[Ben Jonson]], for example, wrote masques with the architect [[Inigo Jones]].  [[William Davenant]], who would become one of the major [[impresario]]s of the [[English Restoration]], also wrote pre-Revolutionary masques with Inigo Jones.  The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a [[fireworks]] show.

==The Hollywood spectacular==
When the [[zoetrope]] and [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] technology first appeared, the earliest films were spectacles.  They caught the attention of common people. They showed things people would rarely see, and they showed it to the wide audience.
* [[Thomas Edison]] filmed [[Eiffel Tower]], actual [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] in a simulated attack, and even celebrated [[beauty contest|beauty queens]].
* [[Louis Lumière]] filmed a train pulling into a station in 1895 (''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]''). The camera was in front of the train, and the train "came" directly at the viewer. It astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images.

==Spectacle and society==
Within industrial and post-industrial cultural and state formations, '''spectacle''' has been appropriated to describe appearances that are purported to be simultaneously enticing, deceptive, distracting and superficial. ([[Jonathan  Crary]]: 2005)  Current academic theories of spectacle "highlight how the productive forces of marketing, often associated with media and Internet proliferation, create symbolic forms of practice that are emblematic of everyday situations"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5-6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Spectacle can also refer to a society that critics describe as dominated by [[electronic media]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], and [[surveillance]], reducing citizens to spectators by political neutralization. Recently the word has been associated with the many ways in which a [[capitalist]] structure is purported to create play-like celebrations of its products and leisure time consumption. The work of French Marxist thinker [[Guy Debord]] is perhaps the best-known example of this critical analysis; see his ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967)

[[Image:Stage managers panel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the Part of a freak is stage manager's panel, or "[[Prompt corner]]."]]'''Stage management''' is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and &amp;nbsp;coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

A '''Stage Manager''' is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or "'''Production Stage Manager'''", and one or more '''Assistant Stage Managers'''.

==History==

The title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.

Moving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. 

Between the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects.  

Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.

Though it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—''director'' and ''stage manager''.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fazio| first = Larry| title = Stage Manager: The Professional Experience| isbn = 0-240-80410-4| publisher = [[Focal Press]]| pages = 367| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director [[Preston Sturges]], for example, was employed as an ASM on [[Isadora Duncan]]'s production of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' at the age of 16 and a half:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}}, p. 123-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later [[Brock Pemberton]] hired him as an ASM on [[Antoinette Perry]]'s production of ''Goin' Home'', which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, ''[[The Guinea Pig (play)|The Guinea Pig]]'', in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}} pp. 239-245&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
=== Stage Management Kit ===

* First aid kit/hygiene supplies
** Band-aids
** Epi pen or sugar pen
** Pain medication such as Ibuprofen or Tylenol
** Tweezers
** Ace bandages

* Sticky notes for line notes or other notes in the script

=== Means of Communication ===
It is important to keep lines of communication open between the stage manager and all other departments of the production.
* Technology
** Phones
*** Actors' Equity requires a dedicated line in a production office, but most people in a cast and crew will have personal cell phones available
** Texting/Calling
*** The stage manager may need to text or call actors or crew members to give them reminders or check up on them if they are late for a call time.
** Email
*** Email can be useful for communication between production departments, sending reminders to cast and crew, or distribution of rehearsal reports and other materials
**** The SM might utilize a feedback loop - ask the recipients to reply to show they have received and understand the information
***** "Communication without feedback isn't communication, it's broadcasting." - Ed Baker
** Headset/walkie talkies
*** During tech, dress rehearsals, and the run of the show, the Stage Manager may need to be on headset to call cues and communicate with lights, sound, and any Assistant Stage Managers
** Call board
*** The call board might be an actual bulletin board backstage, or an electronic message board.  Usually the sign-in sheet for actors and crew will be located on the call board

=== Prompt Book ===
The prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues.  It may also contain:
* Shift plot for props
* A pre-show schedule
* A pre-show checklist
* Light and sound cue breakdowns
* Rehearsal schedules
* Rehearsal and performance reports
* Confidential emergency health history
* Cast and crew contact sheet

*

== Regional differences ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, ''Stage Manager'' is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as ''the stage manager''. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as ''Production Stage Manager'' (first or head stage manager), ''Stage Manager'' (second stage manager), and ''Assistant Stage Manager'' (third stage manager).&lt;ref name=Fazio /&gt;

Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the [[Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A [[fringe theatre]] show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a [[West End theatre]] show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the [[British Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers.

====Deputy stage manager====
The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Pallin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistant stage manager====
The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.

==Show control based venues==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
Many live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, [[show control]] systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.

== Different Areas of Stage Management ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.

For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.

== Stage Managers and Unions ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
With being a Stage Manager you also need to know what unions you will be working with. Some of the things that a Stage Manager needs to know about working with a union is how often do they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. 
=== Actors Equity Association ===
Commonly referred to as [[Actors Equity]] (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living  conditions, livable wages, and benefits.
=== IATSE ===
[[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) represents the stage hands in the theatre.
=== United Scenic Artists ===
[[United Scenic Artist]] also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries.&lt;ref&gt;United Scenic Artists is affiliated with International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

{{Nihongo|'''''Strawberry Panic!'''''|ストロベリー・パニック!|Sutoroberī Panikku!}} is a series of Japanese illustrated short stories written by [[Sakurako Kimino]], which focus on a group of [[Adolescence|teenage girls]] attending three affiliated all-girl schools on Astraea Hill. A common theme throughout the stories is the intimate [[lesbian]] relationships between the characters. The original artist was [[Chitose Maki]], who was succeeded by [[Namuchi Takumi]] when production of the [[manga]] and [[light novel]]s began.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt;

Following ''Strawberry Panic!'''s first run in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' it was six months before results began to indicate that the series was a success, and that its fans were growing in number;&lt;ref name="Jul04"/&gt; the manga and light novels which followed were a reflection of its popularity. The series became sufficiently popular for [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] to license the manga series and light novels for English language distribution. ''Strawberry Panic!'' was one of the debut titles on the company's light novel and [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] manga production lines.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; An [[anime]] television series was produced in 2006 by [[Madhouse (studio)|Madhouse]] and is licensed by [[Media Blasters]]. A [[visual novel]] was produced in 2006 by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] for the [[PlayStation 2]].

There is a slight difference in the title of the series between media and national affiliation. The original short stories, manga, light novels, and video game used the [[exclamation mark]] in the title; the anime excluded it. When the manga and light novel series were licensed for English language distribution, Seven Seas Entertainment did not use the exclamation mark in the title. The appearance of the logo for ''Strawberry Panic!'' has changed four times. The subtitle "Girls' School in Fullbloom" was added during the short stories stage, and later appeared on the Japanese covers of the light novels, manga, and video game version, but was excluded from the anime adaptation and the English covers of the light novels and manga.

==Plot==
[[File:Astrea Hill.png|thumb|200px|left|Aerial view of Astraea Hill. Locations include: Strawberry Dorms (top), Lulim (left), Miator (bottom), church and library (center), and Spica (right).]]

===Setting===
The setting for ''Strawberry Panic!'' is {{Nihongo|Astraea Hill|アストラエアの丘|Asutoraea no Oka}}, a very large hilltop where the three affiliated schools of Miator, Spica and Lulim, are located.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; Each school has its own student council, which governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish system]] of grade numbering. Students are ranged from grades one through six, the equivalent of the three years of junior-high and high school in Japan, and seventh through twelfth grade in North America.&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt;

The hill is known as a sacred area which no men are allowed to enter.&lt;ref name="ncsx"/&gt; A prominent feature is a very large [[Catholic]] church in the center of the hill near a small lake; the church can be seen from a long distance away. There is a horse ranch at Spica. The students may go and study for their classes at a library on the lake's shore. Although only implied in the anime, the manga explains that the library building has another name, "The Secret Garden". It is well-known on campus as a ''[[Meeting|rendezvous]]'' for secret lovers.&lt;ref name="spmanga2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 2|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students living on campus occupy a [[dormitory]] referred to as the {{Nihongo|"Strawberry Dorms"|いちご舎|Ichigo Sha|lit. "Strawberry House"}}, although its correct name is ''[[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] Dormitory'', named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100&amp;nbsp;years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.

The building's name is based on its similarity to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When ''Strawberry Panic!'' was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory was not a single building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt;

===Story===
The plot of ''Strawberry Panic!'' revolves around the lives of the [[Adolescence|adolescents]] who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's [[Strawberry Panic!#Etoile system|Etoile]], a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.

In the ensuing story, Nagisa is introduced to other students from each of the three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the [[Intimate relationship|relationships]] the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of ''Strawberry Panic!'' are the [[lesbian]] relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit [[fan service]]&amp;nbsp;– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations&amp;nbsp;– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of [[Astronomical object|astronomical]] [[star]] imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor [[Catholic]] religious undertones including a [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary]] statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.

===Main characters and schools===
&lt;!-- Please add extra information on the main character article, not here. --&gt;
{{main|List of Strawberry Panic! characters}}
At each of the three schools, there are four main characters, who comprise the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only those twelve appear in the subsequently adapted visual novel version.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Other characters were introduced in the manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict, and these additional characters are also featured in the anime adaptation.

&lt;span id="Miator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Miator's Girls' Academy
:{{Nihongo|St. Miator's Girls' Academy|聖ミアトル女学園|Sei Miatoru Jogakuen}}, the oldest of the three schools which has a history of over 100 years, is known for upholding old traditions. It was founded on a monastery and is seen as the school for "brides", reinforced by the existence of extracurricular classes including [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Ikebana|flower arrangement]], and Japanese dancing.&lt;ref name="Jan04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=January 2004|pages=134–136|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for students to be engaged before graduation.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; The school uniform is a long black dress, designed in the [[Gothic Lolita]] fashion. At Miator, the [[Class (education)|class]] names are associated with objects from nature, such as {{Nihongo|moon|月|tsuki}}, {{Nihongo|flower|花|hana}} and {{Nihongo|snow|雪|yuki}}.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; In the Strawberry Dorms, there is a concept called the room temp system for students from Miator. Every underclassman entering the dormitories, if they are chosen to serve the upperclassman as room temps, perform maid duties, which include cleaning the room of the students they are assigned to serve.&lt;ref name="SP5"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Younger Sisters|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep05|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 1, 2006|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Nagisa Aoi is the main character of the story. She is a cheerful girl who finds pleasure in making new friends, which she finds easy to do because of her open personality and sociable attitude. The first person she meets at Miator is Shizuma Hanazono,&lt;ref name="SP1"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Cherry Blossom Hill|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep01|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=April 3, 2006|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mysterious upperclassman and the [[#Etoile system|Etoile]] as the story begins, which gives Miator significant influence. Nagisa at first finds that she is strangely affected when in the presence of Shizuma, who in turn is extremely interested in Nagisa in both the manga and the anime. The next girl she meets is Tamao Suzumi,&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt; who becomes her close friend and roommate. Tamao is well regarded among her fellow Miator students; among the first-years, she is seen as a viable Etoile candidate.  She expresses some light and playful interest in Nagisa, but it is much less overt than Shizuma's interest and is very downplayed in the manga. The last main character from Miator is Chiyo Tsukidate, a timid first year student who is employed as the [[Maid|room temp]] for Nagisa and Tamao; in the anime, she deeply admires Nagisa.&lt;ref name="SP5"/&gt;

&lt;span id="Spica"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Spica's Girls' Institute
:{{Nihongo|St. Spica's Girls' Institute|聖スピカ女学院|Sei Supika Jogakuin}} has the white colored buildings and uniforms, and was built after Miator. The school prides itself in advancing the independence of women who play a role in improving society.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; It is well known for its culture and the accomplishments of its sports program compared to the other two schools. Spica has what is known as the St. Spica Choir, or the "Saintly Chorus," which consists of students from Spica who perform at special events and even concerts for students at Astraea Hill. At Spica, the class names are numbers in French, such as ''un'' (one), ''deux'' (two), and ''trois'' (three).&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Spica and Miator compete with each other quite aggressively, which often ends in dispute when students from these two schools get together.&lt;ref name="SP3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Attic|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep03|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=April 17, 2006|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Hikari Konohana, a shy and quiet girl, is the main focus among the main characters who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari are members of the St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention.&lt;ref name="spmanga1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.&lt;ref name="SP8"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hydrangeas|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep08|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 22, 2006|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="Lulim"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
;St. Lulim's Girls' School
:{{Nihongo|St. Lulim's Girls' School|聖ル・リム女学校|Sei Ru Rimu Jogakkō}} (originally Le Lim&lt;ref name="Jul04"/&gt;) is the newest of the three schools, and has pink colored buildings and uniforms. Its uniform is modeled after a traditional [[Japanese school uniform]] style. At Lulim, the class names are the letters from the [[Latin alphabet]]: A, B, C, etc.&lt;ref name="MWcharacterpage"/&gt; Students at St. Lulim's are traditionally free and relaxed, and are rarely seen fighting. The students enjoy a lot of freedom in terms of activities, or the clubs they are allowed to form. In effect, there are a wide range of clubs at St. Lulim's ranging from dancing, to cooking, to anything else a group of at least three people can think up.&lt;ref name="anime6"/&gt;

:Of the three schools, St. Lulim&lt;ref&gt;"Lulim" is the spelling used on [http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php#003 MediaWorks' official ''Strawberry Panic!'' website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915020351/http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php |date=2008-09-15 }} and on the Japanese covers of the light novels and manga, although "Le Rim" is used in [[Media Blasters]]' translation of the anime version.&lt;/ref&gt; has the least emphasis on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice or simply a shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, the youngest of the group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear {{Nihongo|Percival|パーシバル|Pāshibaru}} which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.&lt;ref name="SP20"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Confession|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep20|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=August 14, 2006|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etoile system===
{{Nihongo|'''Etoile'''|エトワール|Etowāru}} is a French word meaning ''[[star]]''. The Etoile system of Astraea Hill is employed as the internal politics between the schools and governs school operations. Little is shown as to the influence the teachers and sisters have on the inter-school politics. The system is designed for two Etoiles to be instated at the same time in order to work as a team. In the anime, Shizuma Hanazono is the sole Etoile,&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt; the other Etoile having died, which is explained in the latter part of the story. The two Etoiles are seen as [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]]s for Astraea Hill. Although Astraea has three schools, both Etoiles must come from the same school. They have certain specific duties, such as greeting new students arriving at Astraea Hill, participating in important school events, and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, among others. They are given a private greenhouse in which to grow flowers for use during school events.&lt;ref name="anime6"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Greenhouse|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep06|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=May 8, 2006|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etoiles are elected after going through what is known as {{Nihongo|''The Etoile Election''|エトワール選|Etowāru-sen}}, which consists of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions.&lt;ref name="spmanga2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spmanga1"/&gt; The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election,&lt;ref name="anime26"/&gt; at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the [[pendant]]s: one is red, the other is blue. The [[Senpai and kōhai|older student]] receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.&lt;ref name="anime26"&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Beginning|episodelink=List of Strawberry Panic episodes#ep26|series=Strawberry Panic!|network=[[Chiba TV]]|airdate=September 25, 2006|number=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Strawberry Panic! first short story.png|thumb|200px|right|The first short story from the reader participation project featuring Nagisa and Shizuma as the first couple.]]
Since the first issue of [[ASCII Media Works]]' ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' was published, the editors of the magazine have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. ''Strawberry Panic!''{{'}}s origin was in the October 2003 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' where it was announced after the ending of [[Sakurako Kimino]]'s previous work ''[[Sister Princess]]'' that a new reader participation project would start the following month.&lt;ref name="Oct03"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=October 2003| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project.&lt;ref name="Nov03"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=November 2003|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters and at the same time younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in ''Dengeki G's Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Nov03"/&gt;

In December 2003, the characters from Spica (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced and in the January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by [[Chitose Maki]]; the reader participation game began in this issue.&lt;ref name="Jan04"/&gt; Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Feb04"/&gt; Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.&lt;ref name="Feb04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2004|language=Japanese|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the results of the polls were printed in the March 2004 issue, the rules of the game had been changed from the original concept, showing that readers wanted to focus on the relationships between the girls, and in this respect, the readers could vote on who they wanted to be coupled together.&lt;ref name="Mar04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=March 2004|pages=127–137|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of votes for this first round were less than 2000.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; Noting this, the editorial staff lifted the restriction on only coupling within the same school, along with the restriction of only allowing the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna to couple. This resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between the twelve characters in the series. In this issue, it was explained that four events were planned for the stories that followed: Easter, Athletic Carnival, Cultural Festival, and Christmas Bazaar. The "Etoile" title was born in this issue, which was initially used to crown the best couple voted first by the readers in each of the four events to follow.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; These events were going to be carried out by the three schools in cooperation. It became such that the planning of the schools resulted in them in a triangle position, having the dormitories at the center. The reader's position as the elder brother was canceled in this issue, and the game became a simple popularity vote for coupling. Due to this new system, Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna ceased to be sisters;&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; surnames were later added to clarify this. After the first [[story arc]] of the short stories concluded, it was shown that the number of votes had increased sharply due to the new voting mechanisms. The Etoile voting was announced in the July 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been the case beforehand. The deadline for voting was shifted to the middle of every month, and online voting was introduced. In September 2004, the voting for the next Etoile was shifted to be online-only; the voting for the ''Dormitory Panic'' arc became mail voting only.&lt;ref name="Sep04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=September 2004|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reader participation game ended after ten rounds of voting in the February 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' where it was announced that the series would be continued in other forms, such as the light novels and manga that followed.&lt;ref name="Feb05"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2005|pages=163–174|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original short stories and the poll results of the reader participation game were used as a basis for subsequent releases of ''Strawberry Panic!''.&lt;ref name="Feb05"/&gt;

===Short stories===
{{see also|List of Strawberry Panic! short stories}}
The first results of the polls from the reader participation project appeared in the form of the first three short stories which resulted from direct fan involvement in the March 2004 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; The stories were written by [[Sakurako Kimino]] and illustrated by [[Chitose Maki]]. Over the following months, the stories continued, producing the first [[story arc]] named the {{Nihongo|''Etoile Chapter''|エトワール編|Etowāru-hen}} containing eighteen stories which ran between March and July 2004. Due to the concerns that there was not enough time between the Athletic Festival (an early summer event) and the Cultural Festival (an autumn event), the second, and last, story arc named the {{Nihongo|''Dormitory Panic Chapter''|寄宿舎パニック編|Kishukusha Panikku-hen}} containing seven stories began the next month, running between August 2004 and January 2005. The second arc's stories, which were longer than the earlier pieces, involved taking one of the three main characters, performing coupling for them with one of the other eleven girls and presenting them in various situations. None of the original stories were ever published again in [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]]. The stories themselves were more or less [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]], in which each gave a brief glimpse into what was referred to as a "yuri coupling".&lt;ref name="okazu"&gt;{{cite web|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date= April 11, 2006|url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2006/04/11/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic-2/|title=Okazu: Yuri Anime: Strawberry Panic|work=Okazu | publisher=[[Yuricon]] | accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic.html --&gt;

Between May and September 2005, a revised series of the short stories was produced; once per month, five more supplementary short stories were published during this time period, each of which was longer than any of the previous pieces. Although each individual story had its own title, the stories were under the collective title of "The Girls, [[Lord's Prayer|who art in heaven]]". After the ending of this short compilation in September 2005, it was decided that the original illustrator, Chitose Maki, would be replaced by [[Namuchi Takumi]] for future ''Strawberry Panic!'' projects.&lt;ref name="Sep05"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=September 2005|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet radio show===
Between November 2005 and December 2006, [[Lantis (company)|Lantis Web Radio]] hosted a radio show entitled {{Nihongo|''[[List of Strawberry Panic! albums#Web radio CDs|Mai &amp; Ai no Dengeki G's Radio Strawberry Panic!: Oneesama to Ichigo Sōdō]]''|麻衣&amp;愛の電撃G’sラジオ ストロベリー・パニック!~お姉様といちごそうどう~}}. The show was hosted by [[Mai Nakahara]], who voiced Nagisa Aoi in the anime edition, and [[Ai Shimizu]], who voiced both Tamao Suzumi and Kizuna Hyūga in the anime. The show contained sixty-one episodes, which were divided between three CDs; the first went on sale on March 8, 2006.&lt;ref name="Lantis-CDs"/&gt; The other two releases came out on July 5, 2006 and January 11, 2007 in Japan.&lt;ref name="Lantis-CDs"/&gt; The radio show included nine guests who had played other [[Seiyū|voice acting]] roles in the anime version, and [[CooRie|Rino]], singer of the opening theme "Sweetest" in the PlayStation 2 game version.

===Manga===
The ''Strawberry Panic!'' manga, written by [[Sakurako Kimino]] and illustrated by [[Namuchi Takumi]], was serialized in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]] have been published in Japan under [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' ''[[Dengeki Comics]]'' label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; While the manga's story is unfinished, ''Strawberry Panic!'' has not made an appearance in ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō.&lt;ref name="spmanga1"/&gt; The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until the latter part of the series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt;

===Light novels===
The announcement that a ''Strawberry Panic!'' [[light novel]] series was to be written based on the original short stories appeared in the April 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''. Work on writing and illustrating the novels began in May 2005, by the same two people who worked on the manga. The announcement that the writing was finished appeared in the September 2005 issue of the same magazine, although the first novel was published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] on their ''[[Dengeki Bunko]]'' publishing label, on March 10, 2006. The first volume had Shizuma and Nagisa on the cover and the second volume, released on August 9, 2006, had Amane and Hikari on the cover.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"/&gt; The third and last volume, released on December 10, 2006, had Chikaru and Kizuna on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/5162KJBFAYL._SS500_.jpg|title= ''Strawberry Panic!'' light novel volume 3 cover image|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=October 2, 2008|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] announced on September 13, 2006 that they had licensed the right to release the English translations of the ''Strawberry Panic!'' light novels and the manga series. After several delays, the English version of the first light novel was released in March 2008, and the second volume light novel was released on July 8, 2008. An omnibus volume containing the three light novels was released in June 2011.&lt;ref name="sevenseas"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gomanga.com/manga/strawberrypanic.php|title=Strawberry Panic!|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
{{see also|List of Strawberry Panic episodes}}
The [[anime]] series, entitled ''Strawberry Panic'' (without the [[exclamation mark]]), was produced by the Japanese animation studio [[Madhouse (studio)|Madhouse]] and directed by [[Masayuki Sakoi]]. The series was composed by Tatsuhiko Urahata, and featured two other screenwriters Hideo Takayashiki and Kazuyuki Fudeyasu. The character design was done by Kyūta Sakai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strawberrypanic.com/staff/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212044559/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/staff/index.html|title=Anime staff at anime's official website|archivedate=February 12, 2008|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|accessdate=March 21, 2009|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; working from the original designs by [[Chitose Maki]] and later [[Namuchi Takumi]]. The twenty-six episode anime aired in Japan between April 3 and September 25, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215050943/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/onair/backnumber.html|url=http://ww.strawberrypanic.com/onair/backnumber.html|title=''Strawberry Panic'' on air info backnumber episode listing|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|archivedate=December 15, 2007|accessdate=March 21, 2009|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a central [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] theme.

The anime series is mainly based on the short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a slightly lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the three girls that they each are or become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in the election of the new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. [[Fan service]], or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.

In Japan, eight [[DVD]] compilations, in regular and special editions, were released containing three episodes each, between June 23, 2006, and January 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212024548/http://www.strawberrypanic.com/product/dvd01.html|url=http://www.strawberrypanic.com/product/dvd01.html|title=''Strawberry Panic!''

The game is played over the course of a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1. In "boy mode", each day concludes with a [[super deformed]] image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the [[Computer display|monitor]]. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a [[Speech balloon#Thought bubbles|thought bubble]] above her head. In "girl mode", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a "Strawberry chance" system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message {{Nihongo|"Chance!"|チャンス!|Chansu!}} is displayed in the upper right screen corner.&lt;ref name="ncsx"/&gt;

==Reception==
During the reader participation game running in ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', which were to determine who would be the subjects in the couplings between the characters of each respective school. The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with the highest number of votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes.&lt;ref name="Mar04"/&gt; The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes.&lt;ref name="May04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=May 2004|language=Japanese|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple for the third time in a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.&lt;ref name="Jul04"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=July 2004|language=Japanese|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Strawberry Panic!'' short stories were initially panned by Erica Friedman as being "distinctly derivative of ''[[Maria-sama ga Miteru]]''".&lt;ref name="okazu"/&gt; Friedman is the president of [[Yuricon]], an [[anime convention]] geared towards fans of [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it".&lt;ref name="okazustories"&gt;{{cite web|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date=June 16, 2004| url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2004/07/16/yuri-reviews-strawberry-panic/ |title=Okazu: Yuri Reviews: ''Strawberry Panic!''|work=Okazu|publisher=[[Yuricon]]|accessdate=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- old-url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2004/07/yuri-reviews-strawberry-panic.html --&gt; After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version,&lt;ref name="okazu"/&gt; Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that "[the anime] turned out pretty good".&lt;ref name="okazufinal"&gt;{{cite web|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date=September 28, 2006|url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2006/09/28/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic/|title=Okazu: Yuri Anime: ''Strawberry Panic''|work=Okazu|publisher=[[Yuricon]]|accessdate=March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/09/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic.html --&gt; She went on to say, "There's no denying that ''Strawberry Panic!'' wasn't brilliant, but considering that it was meant to be trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap."&lt;ref name="okazufinal"/&gt; [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] regarded the ''Strawberry Panic!'' manga as "a nearly plotless cascade [where] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suvudu.com/2010/02/365-days-of-manga-day-160-strawberry-panic.html|title=365 Days of Manga, Day 160: Strawberry Panic!|last=Thompson|first=Jason|date=February 22, 2010|publisher=Suvudu|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five subtitled DVDs released by [[Media Blasters]] were reviewed by [[Anime News Network]] (ANN). The first DVD was declared rental-worthy by ANN, citing the characters as being "a lot of fun" and the series as being a "very laid-back show" that would work well as a relaxing watch over a weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2008-06-09|title=Shelf Life: Strawberry Fields|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date= June 9, 2008|author=Dong, Bamboo|accessdate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in [[fan service]], humor, and that it "struggles to find any other reason to be compelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/strawberry-panic/sub.dvd-1|title=Strawberry Panic!

''Strawberry Panic!'' was one of the premier titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) production lines when it was licensed for [[English language]] distribution by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/manga-articles/101/|title=Interview with Adam Arnold from Seven Seas Entertainment|publisher=Anime Boredom|accessdate=September 28, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821100707/http://animeboredom.co.uk/manga-articles/101/|archivedate=August 21, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, "How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?" His response was, "We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like ''[[Pita-Ten]]'', ''[[Ballad of a Shinigami|Shinigami no Ballad]]'' or ''Strawberry Panic!''....In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of the property otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/features_gomanga_012.php|title=Interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|accessdate=September 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dish''''' is a satirical television series that aired on the [[Style Network]] in the [[United States]]. The show (first airing August 16, [[2008 in television|2008]]), hosted by [[Danielle Fishel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=34&amp;num=25119 Topanga Lawrence Juggles "The Dish" And The Books], Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith, ''National Ledger.com'', Feb 24, 2009. Retrieved 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; skewers the latest in pop culture (television, movies, magazines, celebrities, etc.) in similar fashion to sister network [[E! Entertainment Television]]'s series ''[[The Soup]]''. The show also aired on International [[E! Channel|E!]] channels alongside ''The Soup''. The show's final episode aired March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of [[NBCUniversal]] and [[Comcast]] was completed. The merger had brought former competitors [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style, nullifying much of the video material available to ''The Dish'', as many Bravo and Oxygen programs under NBC's ownership apart from Style had been used for satirical purposes for the show.

==Format==
As with ''[[The Soup]]'', the show primarily consists of Fishel providing humorous commentary on content (such as clips of television programs), arranged in themed segments. Unlike ''The Soup'' however, the show places more emphasis on fashion and [[celebrity culture]]. A [[running gag]] throughout the series was Fishel's being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and being recognized solely for her most famous role as [[Topanga Lawrence]] from ''[[Boy Meets World]]''.

==Segments==

===Regular segments===
*"Hot Dish"&amp;nbsp;– The segment includes celebrity news and gossip of the week.
*"Clip Closet"&amp;nbsp;– Clips are shown recapping different shows of that week. Often signaled by a closet with TV show title cards and the Clip Closet logo appears in one of the cards. This segment runs in a very similar fashion to Reality Show Clip Time on ''[[The Soup]]''.
*"Daylight Cravings"&amp;nbsp;– This segment covers morning shows, like ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and ''[[Rachael Ray (TV series)|Rachael Ray]]''.
*"F-Bombs"&amp;nbsp;– Fashion bombs. This segment covers bad celebrity fashions. There are also Viewer F-Bombs where viewers show their own pictures of bad fashion moments.
*"Let's Go Shopping"&amp;nbsp;– Highlighting accessories, gifts and online items.
*"Freak of the Week"&amp;nbsp;– At the end of the show, Fishel shows a clip of someone freaking out.  It is usually a participant in a reality show, but occasionally it is a fictional character in a scripted show.

===Semi-regular segments===
*"Gaga MegaTracker 10000"*&amp;nbsp;– This segment shows [[Lady Gaga]]'s latest activity and fashions.
*"Great Moments in Modern Literature"*&amp;nbsp;– This segment covers recent releases of books.
*"Here Comes the Brides"&amp;nbsp;– Features clips from wedding shows, such as ''[[My Big Redneck Wedding]]'', ''[[Bridezillas]]'', etc.
*"What the  @#!*%  is going on in this AD?"*&amp;nbsp;– This segment covers ads in magazines that are unusual.

===Former segments===

'''''The Karate Kid''''' is an American [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] [[drama film|drama]] [[multi-media]] franchise, created by screenwriter [[Robert Mark Kamen]]. The franchise began in 1984 with ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', and was followed by three film sequels: ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]'' (1986), ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Next Karate Kid]]'' (1994). ''[[Cobra Kai]]'', a television series that serves as a sequel to the films, was released in 2018.

The success of the first two films spawned an [[The Karate Kid (TV series)|animated television series]] that aired in 1989, while a [[The Karate Kid (2010 film)|remake film]] centered on [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] was released in 2010, set outside of the main story and featuring a similar plot to the original.

While the first film garnered critical acclaim, critics were less enthusiastic about its sequels. However, the ''[[Cobra Kai]]'' television series garnered critical and audience acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/cobra_kai/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the series has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and [[teen film]] narratives in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bruce David|last2=Mahan|first2=Jeffrey H.|title=Religion and Popular Culture in America|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=[[Oakland, California]]|isbn=0520246896|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaRJ2KkXSBQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31 31]|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Catherine|title=Teen Film: A Critical Introduction|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=1847886868|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CB4NOZ2_NGQC&amp;pg=PT136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandise==
The film spawned a franchise of related items and memorabilia such as action figures, head bands, posters, T-shirts, and [[The Karate Kid (video game)|a video game]]. A novelization was made by B.B. Hiller and published in 1984. The novel had a scene that was in the rehearsal when Daniel encounters Johnny during school at lunch. Also at the end, there was a battle between Miyagi and Kreese in the parking lot after the tournament which was the original ending for the film and used as the beginning of ''The Karate Kid Part II''.

In 2015, toy company [[Funko]] revived The Karate Kid action figures. Two versions of character Daniel Larusso, a version of character Johnny Lawrence and a version of Mr. Miyagi were part of the line. The toys were spotted at retailers [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Karate Kid (1984) Action Figures have been Revived by Funko |work= Z.Love's Entertainment Blog|date=2015-10-10|url= http://lovezack.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-karate-kid-1984-action-figures-have.html|accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a proposed remake of ''The Mummy'' would have been directed by horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]]. Barker’s vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.&lt;ref name=Slotek&gt;{{cite news | last = Slotek | first = Jim | title = Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = May 2, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cinescape&gt;The Mummy That Wasn't", Cinescape (May 3, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;Hobson, Louis B (May 1, 1999). "Universal rolls out new, improved Mummy", Calgary Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".&lt;ref name=Slotek/&gt;

In 1999, [[Stephen Sommers]] wrote and directed a remake of ''The Mummy'', loosely based on the original film of 1932.  This film switches genres from the emphasis on horror to adventure, concentrating more on action sequences, special effects, comedy, and a higher element of Egyptian lore. The film became a box office success spawning two sequels, several video games, a [[The Scorpion King|spin-off series]], and an animated television series. The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third one received mostly negative reviews.

Two video game adaptations of ''The Mummy'' (1999) were developed by [[Rebellion Developments]] and published by [[Konami]] in 2000: an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/014/014640.html|title=The Mummy (PSX)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Game Boy Color]] [[puzzle game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/action/mummy/index.html|title=The Mummy (GBC)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dreamcast]] version was announced but later cancelled in the late 2000. ''The Mummy Returns'' released in late 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and developed by [[Blitz Games]], the [[Game Boy Color]] version was developed by GameBrains, both versions were published by [[Universal Interactive]]. ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (video game)|The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' was released in 2008, developed by [[Eurocom]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Wii]], the [[Nintendo DS]] released was developed by [[Artificial Mind and Movement|A2M]], all versions were published by [[Sierra Entertainment]]. In March 2012, a massive multiplayer online game known as ''The Mummy Online'' was released.

In May 2001, [[Chaos! Comics]] released the first of a three-issue series inspired by the film, titled ''The Mummy: Valley of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=c8d5397b-9fe6-4997-9966-9d903720bdcc|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was supposed to take place between the first film and ''The Mummy Returns''. Rick and Evelyn are on their honeymoon in Egypt and end up embarking on yet another adventure where they must unravel the mysteries of the Orb of Destiny and discover the location of the Valley of the Gods hidden beneath the sands. However, the second and third issues were never published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=c842164c-db3d-4971-9e13-3bda3d8e555a|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue #2)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was most likely due to Chaos later filing bankruptcy in 2002 and selling the rights to all their titles at that time.
Years later in 2008, another Mummy comic series was released by [[IDW Publishing]], spanning four issues. This series was titled ''The Mummy: The Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax''. Unlike the preceding comic series, all of the planned issues were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=b72be0fe-3d59-4755-8aae-5922674ad4d8|title=The Mummy: the Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 until 2003, an animated series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'' was made by [[Universal Animation Studios]] where it was based on the Stephen Sommers series of films. The series was later renamed in the second season as ''The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai''.

The film also inspired a [[roller coaster]] ride named ''[[Revenge of the Mummy|Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride]]'' in [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]], [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Florida|Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|title=Universal Studios Hollywood - Revenge of the Mummy - the Ride|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018222516/http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|archivedate=2008-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rides can also be found in [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]] and [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Singapore|Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalorlando.com/usf_attr_mummy.html|title=Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride at Universal Orlando Resort|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7634">The word ''' Titling''', in the performing arts (opera, drama, audiovisual productions), defines the work of linguistic mediation encompassing [[subtitling]] and [[surtitling]].

==History==
Subtitling developed starting from 1917, during the silent film era, whereas surtitling has been used in the live performing arts since 1983 (at the dawning of digital systems).&lt;br /&gt;
With the appearance of new information systems, which opened the door to [[multilingual titling]] ([[DVD]] was launched on the market in 1986) terminological debate started, too.&lt;br /&gt;
In the audiovisual system, even when more than one language was used, subtitles maintained their position unchanged for many years. The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
Even more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices ([[Santa Fe Opera]], 1998)&lt;ref name="(Santa Fe Opera, 1998)"&gt;[[Figaro Systems]] introduced in 1998 at Santa Fe Opera a custom multilingual display system recalling the aircraft video display units; this system has been lately adopted, through different companies, by some of the most prominent international theatres, such as Copenhagen, Milan, Moscow, Muscat, New York, Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt; or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]], 2011) &lt;ref name="(Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011)"&gt;OperaVoice, in the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino Theatre’s season 2011-2012, developed a wireless multilingual transmission system which is to use mobile consumer devices owned by the audience (smartphones and tablets), and is also interfaceable with projected surtitles.&lt;/ref&gt; or on hybrid solutions ([[Royal Opera House Muscat]], 2012),&lt;ref name="(Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012)"&gt;[[Radio Marconi]], in 2011-2012, realized for the Royal Opera House Muscat the most advanced system of custom multilingual interactive displays integrated to surtitles on LED panel.&lt;/ref&gt; makes the spatial connotation of the term "sur-titles" inappropriate.

==Terminology==
In both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term "titling", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).&lt;ref name=" not specifying if the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles)"&gt;This is also recommended in: FREDDI M. e LURAGHI S., ''Titling for the Opera House: a Test Case for Universals of Translations? '' in INCALCATERRA McLOUGHLIN L., eds., ''Audiovisual Translation'', Peter Lang, Bern-Berlin-New York 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the term "turkey" in the general sport of bowling|Strike (bowling)#Consecutive strikes}}
'''Turkey bowling''' is a [[sport]] which is based on ordinary [[bowling]]: a [[frozen foods|frozen]] [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] serves as a [[bowling ball]] and 10 plastic bottles of [[soft drink]]s or water are the [[bowling pin]]s. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface, for example, ice or a soap covered sheet of painters plastic (using a bar of soap).&lt;ref name=men3-11-03&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/71/71914_protestors_cry_foul_at_turkey_bowling.html "Protestors cry foul at turkey bowling"], ''[[Manchester Evening News]],'' 3/11/2003&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated with [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losalamosnm.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B942433DE-4B1B-4DF9-826E-379B5E464E9A%7D&amp;DE=%7BCCD085E5-D37A-4AB7-AD20-F90412773255%7D]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=39856 "It's a Strike, a Spare. It's Turkey Bowling"], November 24, 2008 ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey bowling is popular in [[minor league]] [[ice hockey]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt;

The original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a [[grocery store]]. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a [[Newport Beach]] [[Lucky's]] branch, while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.&lt;ref name=people&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118874,00.html "Derrick Johnson's Unique Bowling Style Is Pure Poultry in Motion"], ''[[People Magazine]],'' October 01, 1990 Vol. 34 No. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick became a self-appointed [[commissioner]] of the "[[Poultry]] Bowlers Association" and codified the rules and terminology, such as "the [[fowl]] line" (cf. "[[Ten-pin bowling|foul line]]"), "the [[gobbler]]" (three strikes in a row; cf. [[turkey (bowling)]]), "the [[Butterball]]" (a gutterball) and "the [[Furcula|wishbone]]" (a [[7-10 split]]).&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

==Notable occurrences==
Turkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel ''[[Bloodsucking Fiends]]: A Love Story''  by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]], where it was the favorite sport of "The Animals", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels ''[[You Suck]]: A Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2007-01-22-you-suck-fangland_x.htm "'You Suck,' 'Fangland' take vampires in new directions"], a ''[[USA Today]]'' book review&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bite Me: A Love Story|Bite Me]]'').

[[List of 10 Items or Less episodes|Episode 14]] of ''[[10 Items or Less (TV series)|10 Items or Less]]'' TV series was "Turkey Bowling".&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1307081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Guy's Grocery Games]]'' episode "Frozen Food Fight" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.

Every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] morning, Cleveland's Fox affiliate [[WJW-TV]] does its annual Turkey Bowl from a [[Giant Eagle]] store in the Greater [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of [[Canning|canned]] [[cranberry sauce]], [[cup stacking|stacked]] in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round [[single-elimination tournament|knockout tournament]] format. In the 2010 edition it was hosted by morning features and man about town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's [[Breakfast television|morning newscast]]. The broadcast began in 1999.

==Controversy==
[[Animal rights]] proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people.&lt;ref name=cjo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/111898/kan_turkeybowling.shtml |title=Group hopes to stuff turkey bowling |publisher=Cjonline.com |date=1998-11-18 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=cjo/&gt;    In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of [[UK]] Great Turkey Bowling Champion at [[Manchester Arena|Manchester Evening News Arena]] was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys.&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt; In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2007/11/22/regional%20news/19048960.txt |title=Norman the turkey will live past Thanksgiving, rescue group says |publisher=Dailyfreeman.com |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkeys voting for Christmas''' is an English [[idiom]] used as a [[metaphor]]  or [[simile]] (in the construct "like turkeys voting for Christmas") in reference to an apparently suicidal ("death-wish"&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;) choice, especially a political vote against one's [[self-interest]]. In modern times, in the [[United Kingdom]], turkeys are commonly eaten as part of the [[Christmas dinner#United Kingdom|English Christmas dinner]]. Since 1573 they have been available in the UK at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Harland]] (1858). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwAVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1059 ''The house and farm accounts of the Shuttleworths of Gawthorpe Hall in the county of Lancaster at Smithils and Gawthorpe: from September 1582 to October 1621'']. p.1059. Chetham society,&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations'' writes that a commentator in the ''[[Independent Magazine]]'' traced the origin of the phrase to British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician [[David Penhaligon]],&lt;ref name=ox&gt;"Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations", by Ned Sherrin, ''[[Oxford University Press]]'', Edition 4, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-923716-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5q4XBa5jsy8C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=%22turkeys+voting+for+christmas%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22turkeys%20voting%20for%20christmas%22&amp;f=false "Introduction to the first edition"]&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying: "Us voting for the Pact is like a turkey voting for Christmas" in reference to the 1977 [[Lib-Lab Pact]] which he opposed.&lt;ref&gt;"The pact: the inside story of the Lib-Lab government, 1977-8", by Alistair Michie, Simon Hoggart, ''[[Quartet Books]]'', 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=QV_8S9G0LYHgNei0nKkB&amp;ct=result&amp;id=3RhaAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Turkeys+Christmas+penhaligon&amp;q=Christmas+ p. 156]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was soon borrowed by other politicians and public figures.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; In 1979 Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] was faced with a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of no confidence]] called by Scottish nationalists, who were upset with Labour's treatment of a recent [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1979|Scottish devolution referendum]]. In the resulting vote the Scottish nationalists sided with the Conservative opposition against the Labour government, despite the fact that the Conservatives opposed devolution. During his speech, Callaghan stated that "If they win, there will be a general election. I am told that the current joke going around the House is that it is the first time in recorded history that turkeys have been known to vote for an early Christmas." The [[Scottish National Party]] ultimately lost most of its representation in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|resulting election]].

in 2000 British MP [[Teresa Gorman]], who opposed the [[Maastricht Treaty]], stated; "If the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted for Maastricht it would be like 651 turkeys voting for Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gazette-news.co.uk/2000/2/18/207686.html "Billericay: The Dame who didn't give a damn..."], ''Daily Gazette'', 18 February 2000 {{Dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent anecdotal example was displayed in the UK in 2016, whereby areas which were net beneficiaries of EU subsidies voted by a majority to leave the EU and then campaigned to preserve their EU funding afterwards: for example, Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-cornwall-issues-plea-for-funding-protection-after-county-overwhelmingly-votes-in-favour-of-a7101311.html "Cornwall issues plea to keep EU funding after voting for Brexit"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009071311/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-cornwall-issues-plea-for-funding-protection-after-county-overwhelmingly-votes-in-favour-of-a7101311.html |date=9 October 2018 }}, ''Independent'', 24 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the phrases "turkeys voting for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]" (that being the holiday when turkey is more commonly served) and "chickens voting for [[Colonel Sanders]]" are often used. In [[Canada]], the story of [[Mouseland]] has mice voting for cats.

A similar [[German language|German]] idiom is "Only the most stupid calves would vote for their butchers" ("Nur die dümmsten Kälber wählen ihre Metzger selber"). [[Bertold Brecht]] alluded to it in his ''Kälbermarsch'' ("March of the calves", 1933), a parody of the Nazi anthem "[[The Horst Wessel Song|Horst Wessel Song]]", which was included in his play ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]'' (1943). A similar photomontage of [[John Heartfield]] shows Hitler as a butcher with a chicken and the caption "Don't panic! He's a vegetarian."&lt;ref&gt;Max Nyffeler: ''[http://www.nmz.de/artikel/kaelbermarsch Kälbermarsch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923085010/http://www.nmz.de/artikel/kaelbermarsch |date=23 September 2016 }}.''

[[File:Batenburg gevelsteen, Prinsengracht, Amsterdam.JPG|thumb|200px|Batenburg ("profit castle") gevelsteen, [[Amsterdam]]]]
A '''visual pun''' is a [[pun]] involving an [[image]] or images (in addition to or instead of [[language]]), often based on a [[rebus]].

Visual puns in which the image is at odds with the inscription are common in [[cartoon]]s such as ''Lost Consonants'' or ''[[The Far Side]]'' as well as in Dutch [[gable stone]]s. For instance the "Batenburg" stone from [[Prinsengracht]], Amsterdam, shown here, puns on the words ''baten'' (to profit) and ''burg'' (castle) which together make up the name of [[Batenburg|a village]] near [[Nijmegen]]. European [[heraldry]] contains the technique of [[canting arms]], which can be considered punning.

== Examples ==
* In ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', while Kermit and Fozzie are driving.  Kermit looks at the map and says they need to turn at the fork in the road.  At this point he lowers the map and they see a giant fork (the cutlery) in the middle of the road.
* In ''[[Spaceballs]]'', Dark Helmet tries to order his troops to comb the desert for his adversaries.  The next scene depicts troopers with giant combs, literally combing the desert.
* In ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', when Mario picks up a "fire flower", he becomes fiery. "Fire flower" in Japanese is literally 火花 (hi-bana; fire-flower), meaning spark, hence he is picking up a "spark".
* In ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]'' by [[Jan Švankmajer]], there are a number of visual puns, including: socks in holes (socks crawling into and out of holes, punning on "holes in socks"); Alice opens a [[sardine]] can to reveal a key, punning on the [[Church key|key]] used to open a sardine can.
* In the 1976 version of ''[[The Omen]]'', after speaking with Mr. Thorn (Gregory Peck), a [[nun]] steps into a [[paternoster]] lift - the name meaning "[[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]]".
* The [[:File:CLEP.png|logo]] of the [[Chinese Lunar Exploration Program]] is a stylized 月 (Chinese character for "moon"), but is also a pair of human feet, surrounded by a crescent moon, symbolizing "walking on the moon".
* In the 2015 film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', Riley Andersen's [[train of thought]] is literally a train. In another scene, as Riley's dad is about to give her broccoli, Anger is reading a newspaper titled ''"The Mind Reader"''. In the film Anger is a [[wiktionary:hothead|hothead]] and has a hot head that explodes.
* In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the final scene of [[Luke Skywalker]] standing on a cliff is a [[cliffhanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAPmPDb_Ss|title=An Hour with Mark Hamill Panel {{!}} Star Wars Celebration Europe 2016|publisher=StarWars.com|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=23 December 2016|date=16 July 2016|quote=It's really literally a cliffhanger. The visual pun of [Luke Skywalker] standing on a cliff. Subtle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woodward's Gardens''' was a combination amusement park, museum, art gallery, zoo, and aquarium operating from 1866 to 1891 in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] of [[San Francisco, California]]. The Gardens covered two city blocks, bounded by [[Mission Street|Mission]], Valencia, 13th, and 15th Streets in San Francisco. The site currently has a brick building at 1700 Mission Street, built after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], which features a California Historical Site plaque, and the ''Crafty Fox Alehouse'' on the ground floor (formerly a restaurant called ''Woodward's Garden''). The former Gardens site also features the [[San Francisco Armory]], completed in 1914.

B. Woodward." from 1877 travel guide]]
Woodward's Gardens was owned and operated by Robert B. Woodward (1824-1879), who became wealthy during the [[Gold Rush of 1849]] and through his ownership the '''What Cheer House''', a hotel and inn at 527-531 Sacramento Street at [[William Leidesdorff|Leidesdorff Alley]] in San Francisco. Woodward opened the Gardens on the site of his four-acre estate after moving to [[Napa, California]] with his wife and four children ''(Napa home pictured)''. Early in his career, photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] took many photographs of the Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfranciscomemories.com/woodwardsgardens/history.html Woodward's Gardens entry at San Francisco Memories]&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward had bought the property from U. S. Senator [[John C. Fremont]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Woodward-s-Gardens-comes-to-life-in-book-3990569.php Peter Hartlaub, "Woodward's Gardens Comes to Life in New Book", ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (October 30, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodwards-Gardens-1875-by-TE-Hecht.jpg|thumb|View of Woodward's Gardens]]

In November 1889 Woodward's Gardens housed the famous bear "[[Monarch (bear)|Monarch]]", a bear that was later memorialized on the [[Flag of California]]. Monarch was one of the last known wild grizzly bears captured in California and more than 20,000 people attended the opening day unveiling on November 10, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.monarchbear.org/monarch/|title = The Monarch Bear Institute|accessdate = Nov 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue would attract up to 10,000 people on major holidays such as [[May Day]]. The facility lost popularity after Woodward's death in 1879, and finally closed in 1891. When the Woodward family auctioned off the collection in 1894, much of it was purchased by San Francisco philanthropist [[Adolph Sutro]]. Sutro displayed some of the Woodward's Gardens collection at his [[Cliff House, San Francisco|Cliff House]] beginning in 1896, and at his [[Sutro Baths]] in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A book by Marilyn Blaisdell, ''San Francisciana Photographs of Woodward's Gardens'', includes 100 photos of the site, was published in October 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
