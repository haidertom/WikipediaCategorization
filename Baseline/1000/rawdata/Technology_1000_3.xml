'''50 Things That Made the Modern Economy''' began as a weekly economic history [[Radio documentary|documentary radio]] series on the [[BBC World Service]] presented by economist and journalist [[Tim Harford]]. The first episode was broadcast on Saturday 5 November 2016, and all episodes are available as [[podcast]]s.

Harford explained his motivation "to paint a picture of economic change by telling the stories of the ideas, people, and tools that had far-reaching consequences". He was fascinated by the many unexpected outcomes, such as "the impact of the fridge on global politics, or of the gramophone on income inequality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/51st-thing-that-made-the-modern-economy "BBC World Service invites suggestions for the ’51st Thing’ that made the modern economy"], ''[[BBC World Service]]'', 19 August 2017. Retrieved on 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was subsequently released by Harford as a book titled '''Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy''' in the UK published by [[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown Books]], and as '''Fifty Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy''' in the US published by [[Riverhead Books]]. The hardcover and eBook editions were released on 6 July 2017 in the UK and the US edition was released on 29 August 2017. A paperback edition has been announced for May 2018.

A public call was made for suggestions for a '''51st thing''' in August 2017. Harford chose his six favourite submissions for an online vote from late September to 6 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|title=Vote for the 51st Thing!|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005133320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|archive-date=5 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning item was announced as the [[Credit Card]] in an episode released on 28 October 2017.

==Radio series==

Each of the nine-minute long programmes introduces the story of fifty products or inventions that have revolutionised the modern world.

Each episode was originally broadcast on BBC World Service, with a subsequent broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and distribution as a BBC podcast.

An '''ATM Adaptation layer 1''' or '''AAL1''' is used for transmitting Class A network traffic, that is, real-time, constant [[bit rate]], [[connection oriented]] traffic (example- uncompressed [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]]). Bits are fed in by the application at constant rate and must be delivered to other end with minimum delay, [[jitter]] or overhead. The input is stream of bits without message boundaries. For this traffic, [[error detection]] [[Communications protocol|protocols]] cannot be used since timeouts and retransmission causes delay but the missing cells are reported to the application, that must take its own action to recover from them.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Andante.gif|thumb|right|A typical ticket]] --&gt;
[[Image:Andantescan.jpg|thumb|right|A ticket being validated]]

'''Andante''' is a [[public transport]] ticketing system used in and around [[Porto]], [[Portugal]]. 
It started operation in November 2002 at [[Metro do Porto]] stations and is now a cross-network ticket used on the Porto Metro, selected bus and train routes and the [[Funicular dos Guindais]] cable railway.

Two types of card are currently in use:
*'''Occasional''' or '''Azul''' (blue): This card is a rechargeable ticket intended for occasional riders, and contains a small, flexible memory card within the laminated ticket. The card has an estimated life-span of about one year.
*'''Season''' or '''Gold''': Similar to a [[credit card]] in shape and material, it has a memory chip on the surface. Gold tickets also feature the holder's name and laser-scanned photograph. It has a life-time of several years.

Occasional tickets can be bought at the terminals in stations. Ticket machines can recharge both kinds of ticket, although Gold tickets can only be purchased in ''Lojas Andante'' (Andante Shops). Tickets can also be recharged at [[MultiBanco]] [[automated teller machine|ATMs]]. When purchasing tickets, passengers must select how many zones the card will allow travel within. The minimum Z2 (2 zone) ticket allows travel for 1 hour after validation, with allowed travel time increasing for each valid zone purchased.

Unlike others ticket zoning systems, Andante zones are not concentric. This makes the system slightly fairer, but also slightly more complicated. To travel within the same zone or up to one neighbouring zone you need Z2 ticket, the more zones you need to cross, the higher the Z ticket you need.&lt;ref name="AndanteTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportespublicos.pt/en/glossary/andante/|title=Andante Ticket System|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although with Andante Occasional you can use your tickets in any zones, with Andante Gold you must choose in advance which zones you will be travelling in.

The system uses [[ISO/IEC 14443]] type B for communication between card readers (check-in points, automatic [[vending machine]]s, vending stores and controller handsets) and the card itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inir.pt/sites/conferencias/documentos/2_Microsoft%20PowerPoint%20-%20Forum_inov_Norm_Andante.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081530/http://www.inir.pt/sites/conferencias/documentos/2_Microsoft%20PowerPoint%20-%20Forum_inov_Norm_Andante.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is entirely contactless, with validation activated by holding the ticket a short distance in front of the reader for about a second. Teams of ticket inspectors make random checks across the network with hand-held ticket readers.

'''Button copy''' is a deprecated physical design of [[road sign]]s in the [[United States]]. Round plastic [[retroreflectors|retroreflective]] buttons made of transparent plastic are placed in rows following the contours of sign legend elements, usually painted white, such as letters, numbers, arrows, and borders. In daylight, the buttons visually blend with the white sign legend elements and so are minimally conspicuous. At night, light from each approaching vehicle's [[headlamp]]s strikes the retroreflective buttons and is reflected back towards the eyes of the vehicle's driver. Thus the sign is made sufficiently conspicuous and legible for adequately fast and accurate recognition and interpretation by drivers.

Button copy is no longer manufactured; technologically it has been supplanted by [[retroreflective sheeting]] made by various manufacturers in numerous colors and grades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trafficsign.us/signsheet.html Retroreflective Sheetings Used for Sign Faces]&lt;/ref&gt; As state departments of transportation increasingly stopped specifying button copy signs in favor of signs made with sheeting, it became uneconomic to maintain production of the materials and supplies to make button copy signs. The last state to specify button copy signs was [[Arizona]], which switched to sheeting in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/3d4e957b8741f740 Farewell to Button Copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=December 2012}}
A '''carriage''' is a [[wheel]]ed vehicle for people, usually [[horse-drawn]]; [[Litter (vehicle)|litters (palanquins)]] and sedan chairs are excluded, since they are wheelless vehicles. The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use, though some are also used to transport goods. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage – terms for such include [[stagecoach]], [[charabanc]] and [[bus|omnibus]].  It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable or luxurious. Carriages normally have [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] using [[leaf spring]]s, elliptical springs (in the 19th century) or leather strapping.  Working vehicles such as the (four-wheeled) [[wagon]] and (two-wheeled) [[cart]] share important parts of the history of the carriage, as does too the fast (two-wheeled) [[chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Laszlo. ''The History of the Carriage''. Arco Pub. Co, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Stuart. ''Wagon, Chariot and Carriage: Symbol the Status in the History of Transport''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Herrschaftliche Kutsche.JPG|thumb|Coach of an imperial family, c&amp;nbsp;1870]]

The word ''carriage'' (abbreviated ''carr'' or ''cge'') is from [[Old Northern French]] ''cariage'', to carry in a vehicle.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 1933: Car, Carriage&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''car'', then meaning a kind of two-wheeled cart for goods, also came from Old Northern French about the beginning of the 14th century&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; (probably derived from the [[Late Latin]] ''carro'', a car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=81|year=1855|issue=6|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it was also used for [[railway carriage]]s, and was extended to cover ''[[automobile]]'' around the end of the nineteenth century, when early models were called ''[[horseless carriage]]s''.

A carriage is sometimes called a ''team'', as in "horse and team". A carriage with its horse is a ''rig''.  An elegant horse-drawn carriage with its retinue of servants is an ''equipage''. A carriage together with the horses, harness and attendants is a ''turnout'' or ''setout''. A procession of carriages is a ''cavalcade''.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Some horsecarts found in [[Celts|Celtic]] graves show hints that their platforms were suspended elastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Raimund Karl |title=Überlegungen zum Verkehr in der eisenzeitlichen Keltiké |trans-title=Deliberations on Traffic in the Ironage Celtic Culture |version= |format=.PDF |publisher=Universität Wien |language=German |url=http://www.ausgegraben.org/modules/Static_Docs/data/WKS/WKS3.pdf |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122510/http://www.ausgegraben.org/modules/Static_Docs/data/WKS/WKS3.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four-wheeled wagons were used in prehistoric Europe, and their form known from excavations suggests that the basic construction techniques of wheel and undercarriage (that survived until the age of the motor car) were established then.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Piggott, ''The Earliest Wheeled Transport'' (1983); C.F.E Pare, ''Wagons and Wagon-Graves of the Early Iron Age in Central Europe''. (Oxford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chariot===
The earliest recorded sort of carriage was the [[chariot]], reaching Mesopotamia as early as 1900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgFPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=earliest++carriage+was+the+chariot,used+in+Mesopotamia+in+1900+BC&amp;dq=earliest++carriage+was+the+chariot,used+in+Mesopotamia+in+1900+BC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZuYWWy7PVAhUB1GMKHbTCBB8Q6AEILjAB|title=The history of the carriage|last=Tarr|first=László|date=1969|publisher=Arco Pub. Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Used typically for warfare by Egyptians, the near Easterners and Europeans, it was essentially a two-wheeled light basin carrying one or two passengers, drawn by one to two horses.  The chariot was revolutionary and effective because it delivered fresh warriors to crucial areas of battle with swiftness.

===Roman carriage===
First century BC [[Roman Republic|Romans]] used sprung wagons for overland journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jochen Garbsch |title=Restoration of a Roman travelling wagon and of a wagon from the Hallstadt bronze culture |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~arch/mitt/mitt040.htm |publisher=Leibniz-Rechenzentrum München |format=.HTML |language=German |date=June 1986 |accessdate=2008-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424224047/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~arch/mitt/mitt040.htm |archivedate=2008-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Roman carriages employed some form of suspension on chains or leather straps, as indicated by carriage parts found in excavations.

===Ancient Chinese carriage===
In the kingdom of the Zhou Dynasty the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] were also known to have used carriages as transportation. With the decline of these civilizations these techniques almost disappeared.

===Medieval carriage===
[[File:Kobelwagen, Jean Le Tavernier, nach 1455.jpg|thumb|upright|Horse-drawn wagon, c. 1455]]
[[File:A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants.jpg|thumb|A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants]]
The medieval carriage was typically a four-wheeled wagon type, with a rounded top ('tilt') similar in appearance to the [[Conestoga Wagon]] familiar from the United States.  Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world.  Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Munby" &gt;Julian Munby, ‘From Carriage to Coach: What Happened?’, in Robert Bork and Andrea Kann (eds) The art, science, and technology of medieval travel (Ashgate, 2008), pp.41–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded.  These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier).  Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.

Another form of carriage was the [[pageant wagon]] of the 14th century.  Historians debate on the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon.  The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon.  Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn.  Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns.  Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles.  Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels.  This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.

===Coach===
{{Main|Coach (carriage)}}
[[File:Koets Brussel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.14|A Gala Coupé, 18th century; [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], Brussels]]
One of the great innovations of the carriage was the invention of the suspended carriage or the ''chariot branlant'' (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain).  The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Léon marquis De Laborde. ''Glossaire français du Moyen Age''. Labitte, Paris, 1872. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert and Kann, Andrea (eds) ''The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel''. Ashgate Publishing, 2008, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chains provided a smoother ride in the chariot branlant because the compartment no longer rested on the turning axles. In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach.  However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.

Under King [[Mathias Corvinus]] (1458–90), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of [[Kocs]] between [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED 1933|Coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian [[Coach (carriage)|coach]] was highly praised because it was capable of holding 8 men, used light wheels, could be towed by only one horse (it may have been suspended by leather straps, but this is a topic of debate).&lt;ref name="Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264"&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately it was the Hungarian coach that generated a greater buzz of conversation than the chariot branlant of [[France]] because it was a much smoother ride.&lt;ref name="Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264"/&gt;  Henceforth, the Hungarian coach spread across Europe rather quickly, in part due to [[Ippolito d'Este of Ferrara]] (1479–1529), nephew of Mathias' queen [[Beatrix of Aragon]], who as a very junior Archbishopric of [[Esztergom]] developed a liking of Hungarian riding and took his carriage and driver back to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert and Kann, Andrea (eds) ''The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel''. Ashgate Publishing, 2008. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1550 the 'coach' made its appearance throughout the major cities of Europe, and the new word entered the vocabulary of all their languages.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology for ''Coach'' in ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the new 'coach' seems to have been a concept (fast road travel for men) as much as any particular type of vehicle, and there is no obvious change that accompanied the innovation.  As it moved throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coach’s body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-top to the 'four-poster' carriages that became standard by c.1600.&lt;ref name="Munby" /&gt;

===Later development of the coach===
[[File:James Pollard - The London-Faringdon Coach passing Buckland House, Berkshire - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The London-Farringdon coach, 1835]]
The coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the "boot" in which servants might ride.  The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards.  The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art.  It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel [[Spring (device)|C-spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'.' Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 18th century that steering systems were truly improved. [[Erasmus Darwin]] was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England.  Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage.  First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road.  Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.

A pivoting front axle changes a carriage’s base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackerman Steering]].  Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.

Carriage use in [[North America]] came with the establishment of European settlers.  Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest.  Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south.  Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people.  As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status.  The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation.  As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons.  Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high.  Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had.  These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North.  Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.

Carriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research.  Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled "Horseflesh vs. Steam".&lt;ref&gt;Mechanical Road Carriages: Horseflesh V. Steam. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1823 (Dec. 7, 1895), pp.&amp;nbsp;1434–1435. BMJ Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;  The article highlights the death of the carriage as the means of transportation.

Nowadays, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the [[Amish]]. They are also still used in the [[tourism]] as vehicles for [[sightseeing]] in cities such as [[Bruges]], [[Vienna]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

The most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the [[Royal Mews]] in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use.  These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and [[postillion]]s.  The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events.  Horses pulling a large carriage known as a "covered brake" collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James's Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with The Queen in [[landau (carriage)|landaus]]; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.

Carriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Horse Carriage Parts Horse Drawn Vehicle | url=http://www.liveryone.net/parts.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2003-10-30 | accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top cover for the body of a carriage, called the ''head'' or ''hood'', is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a ''bellows top'' or ''[[calash]]''. A ''hoopstick'' forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an ''imperial''. A closed carriage may have side windows called ''quarter lights'' (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a "glass coach". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a ''[[dashboard]]'' intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a ''wing'' (British). A ''foot iron'' or ''footplate'' may serve as a carriage step.

A carriage driver sits on a ''box'' or ''perch'', usually elevated and small. When at the front it is known as a ''dickey box'', a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A [[footman]] might use a small platform at the rear called a ''footboard'' or a seat called a ''[[rumble seat|rumble]]'' behind the body. Some carriages have a moveable seat called a ''jump seat''. Some seats had an attached backrest called a ''lazyback''.

The shafts of a carriage were called ''limbers'' in English dialect. ''Lancewood'', a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A ''holdback'', consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the ''yoke''. At the end of a [[trace (tack)|trace]], a loop called a ''cockeye'' attaches to the carriage.

In some carriage types the body is suspended from several leather straps called ''braces'' or ''thoroughbraces'', attached to or serving as springs.

===Undergear===
Beneath the carriage body is the ''undergear'' or ''undercarriage'' (or simply ''carriage''), consisting of the running gear and chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Basic Carriage Gear Horse Drawn Vehicles | url=http://www.liveryone.net/gear.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2003-11-02 | accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the ''running gear''. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an ''axle'' or ''axletree''. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or ''forecarriage'', is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a '[[dropped axle]]', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a ''dirtboard'' keeps dirt from the axle arm.

Several structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a ''futchel'', which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the ''backstay'' may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.

A skid called a ''drag'', ''dragshoe'', ''shoe'' or ''skidpan'' retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle. The original feature of this modification was that, instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum, the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed  to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of "pendant-levers" and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position  and be ready for further use.&lt;ref&gt;Patent 9020, 7 July 1841, awarded to Thomas Fuller, a coach-builder of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A catch or block called a ''trigger'' may be used to hold a wheel on a declivity.

A horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a ''[[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth wheel]]'' sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a ''headblock'' might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.

=== Fittings ===
Many of these fittings were carried over to [[horseless carriage]]s and evolved into the modern elements of automobiles. During the [[Brass Era car|Brass Era]] they were often the same parts on either type of carriage (i.e., horse-drawn or horseless). 
* Upholstery (trimming): traditionally similar to the [[upholstery]] of [[furniture]]; evolved into car interior ulholstery such as [[car seat]]s and door trim panels
* Carriage lamps: typically [[oil lamp]]s for centuries, although [[carbide lamp]]s and battery-powered [[electric light|electric lamp]]s were also used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; evolved into car [[headlamp]]s
* Trunk: a [[trunk (luggage)|luggage trunk]] serving the same purpose as, and which gave its name to, later [[trunk (car)|car trunks]]
* [[Toolbox]]: a small box with enough [[hand tool]]s to make simple repairs on the roadside
* [[Blanket]]s: in winter, blankets for the driver and passengers and often [[horse blanket]]s as well
* [[Running board]]: a step to assist in climbing onto the carriage and also sometimes a place for [[standing passenger]]s
* [[Shovel]]: useful for mud and snow in the roadway, to free the carriage from being stuck; was especially important in the era when most roads were [[dirt road]]s, often with deep [[rut (roads)|ruts]]
* [[Whip#Buggy whip and coachwhip|Buggy whip or coachwhip]]: whips for the horses. For obvious reasons, this is one of the components of carriage equipment that did not carry over from horse-drawn carriages to horseless carriages, and that fact has made such whips one of the prototypical or stereotypical examples of products whose manufacture is subject to [[disruptive innovation]]

== Types ==
===Pony trap or horse trap===
[[File:Old horse cart at Snowshill Manor.jpg|thumb|right|An old horse trap at [[Snowshill Manor]]]]
A '''trap''', '''pony trap''' or '''horse trap''' is a light, often sporty, two-wheeled or sometimes four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage, accommodating usually two to four persons in various seating arrangements, such as face-to-face or back-to-back.

===Tonga/tanga (Indian horse carriage)===
{{Main|Tanga (carriage)}}

A '''tanga''' ([[Hindi]]: टाँगा, [[Urdu]]: ٹانگہ, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: টাঙ্গা) or '''Tonga''' is a light horse-drawn carriage used for transportation in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Tangas are a popular mode of transportation because they are fun to ride in, and are usually cheaper to hire than a [[Taxicab|taxi]] or [[Auto rickshaw|rickshaw]]. However, in many cities, tangas are not allowed to use highways because of their slow pace. In [[Pakistan]], tangas are mainly found in the older parts of cities and towns, and are becoming less popular for utilitarian travel and more popular for pleasure. Tangas have become a traditional feature of [[weddings]] and other social functions in Pakistan, as well as in other nations. They are usually pulled by two horses, though some require only one. Others are designed for farm work. The room under the seats is sometimes used by the coachman (locally called "coach-waan") to keep his horse's food and sometimes to keep luggage if required.

Tangas are used for economic activity, mainly to carry heavy goods within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/transport/carts/30011.htm kamat's Potpourri: Carts of India – Horse Pulled Carriage (Tonga)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangas were the most common means of transport in urban India and Pakistan until the early 1980s. Although [[autorickshaw]]s have overtaken them in popularity, tangas are still common today in many cities and villages.

===Volante===
A '''volante''' is a two-wheeled, one- or two-passenger Spanish carriage formerly much used in [[Cuba]]. The axle was behind an open, hooded body. The carriage was driven by a rider on the horse.

===Araba===
{{Main|Araba (carriage)}}
&lt;!-- Missing image: [[File:Chevalier Auguste de Henikstein - Araba. Voiture de Constantinople.jpg|thumb|Araba, [[Ottoman Empire]], 1825]] --&gt;
An '''araba''' (from [[Arabic]]: عربة, ''araba'' or {{lang-tr|araba}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/araba "araba."] Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. MICRA, Inc. 28 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) (also '''arba''' or '''aroba''') is a carriage (such as a [[Cabriolet (carriage)|cabriolet]] or [[coach (carriage)|coach]]), [[wagon]] or [[cart]] drawn by horses or oxen, used in [[Turkey]] and neighboring [[Middle East]]ern countries. It is usually heavy and without springs, and often covered.

===Words related to carriages===
The names of many of these have now passed into obscurity but some have been adopted to describe automotive [[car body style]]s:  ''coupé,'' ''victoria,'' ''[[Brougham (car body)|brougham]],'' ''[[Landau (car)|landau]]'' and ''[[Landau (car)|landaulet]]'', ''cabriolet'' (giving us our ''cab''), ''[[Phaeton body|phaeton]],'' and ''[[limousine]]'' – all these once denoted particular types of carriages.

A person whose business was to drive a carriage was a ''[[coachman]]''. A servant in livery called a ''[[footman]]'' or ''piquer'' formerly served in attendance upon a rider or was required to run before his master's carriage to clear the way. An attendant on horseback called an ''outrider'' often rode ahead of or next to a carriage. A ''carriage starter'' directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A ''hackneyman'' hired out horses and carriages. When hawking wares, a ''hawker'' was often assisted by a carriage.

Upper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as ''carriage folk'' or ''carriage trade''.

Carriage passengers often used a ''lap robe'' as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A ''buffalo robe'', made from the hide of an [[American bison]] dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A ''carriage boot'', fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A ''knee boot'' protected the knees from rain or splatter.

A [[horse]] especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a ''carriage horse''; one for use on a road is a ''road horse''. One such breed is the ''[[Cleveland Bay]]'', uniformly [[Bay (horse)|bay]] in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a ''break'' or ''brake''.

A ''[[carriage dog]]'' or ''coach dog'' is bred for running beside a carriage.

A roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a ''carriage porch'' or ''[[porte cochere]]''. An outbuilding for a carriage is a ''coach house'', which was often combined with accommodation for a [[groom]] or other servants.

A ''[[livery stable]]'' kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with ''[[carriage house]]s'' (''remises'') and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a ''[[mews]]''.

A kind of dynamometer called a ''peirameter'' indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.

==Competitive driving==
{{Main|Driving (horse)|Combined driving|Draft horse showing|Roadster (horse)}}
In most European and English-speaking countries, driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many [[horse show]]s host driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, [[cart]]s, or [[horse and buggy|buggies]] and, occasionally, [[sulky|sulkies]] or [[wagon]]s. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition by companies such as Bennington Carriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bennington.co.uk |title=Bennington Carriages homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England.
Terminology varies: the simple, lightweight two- or four-wheeled show vehicle common in many nations is called a "cart" in the USA, but a "carriage" in Australia.

Internationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving: [[combined driving]], also known as ''horse-driving trials'', an equestrian discipline regulated by the [[Fédération Équestre Internationale]] (International Equestrian Federation) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The [[World Equestrian Games]], held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition.

For [[pony]] drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.

==Types of horse-drawn carriages==

An almost bewildering variety of horse-drawn carriages existed. Arthur Ingram's ''Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour'' lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one's choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions. The types of carriage included the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3280">'''Clymer repair manuals''' are vehicle repair manuals that often focus on powersport vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], [[all-terrain vehicles]], [[personal water craft]] and [[snowmobiles]]. Clymer also has several books dedicated to small engines and "outdoor power equipment" such as [[leaf blower]]s, [[chainsaws]] and other lawn and garden power equipment.

Clymer repair manuals are named after their creator [[Floyd Clymer]], who is described in the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a pioneer in the sport of motorcycling. He was a racer, a motorcycle dealer and distributor, a magazine publisher, a racing promoter, an author and a motorcycle manufacturer."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clymer repair manuals are categorized as an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] product or non-OEM. Unlike [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] manuals, Clymer repair manuals are written specifically for the [[do it yourself]] as well as the professional and experienced mechanic. OEM manuals are often designed for a professional technician, who often has at their disposal an array of specialized tools, equipment and knowledge.

One valuable step in the creation process of a Clymer repair manuals is the complete disassembly and reassembly of the machine. This helps the writers for Clymer provide easy-to-follow instructions that allow the manual user to safely and efficiently service and repair their machine. This high level of detail sets Clymer apart from its factory "OEM" counterparts.

In 2013, [[Haynes Manual|Haynes Publishing Group]] acquired Clymer repair manuals from [[Penton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foliomag.com/2013/ubm-sells-second-property-week UBM Sells Second Property This Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturers covered==

Clymer currently has over three hundred repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Some of the most popular models are the Honda TRX ATVs, International Harvester Farm Tractors, BMW K1200 Series, Harley-Davidson FLH &amp; FLT Twin Cam 88 &amp; 103 models and the MerCruiser Stern Drive Marine Engines.

This article '''compares the technical specifications of multiple high definition formats''', including HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc; two mutually incompatible, high definition optical disc formats that, beginning in 2006, attempted to improve upon and eventually replace the [[DVD]] standard. The two formats remained in a [[format war]] until February 19, 2008 when Toshiba, HD DVD's creator, announced plans to cease development, manufacturing and marketing of HD DVD players and recorders.&lt;ref name=toshibadrophddvd&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm|title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses|publisher=Toshiba Press Department|date=2008-02-19|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other high-definition optical disc formats were attempted, including the multi-layered red-laser [[Versatile Multilayer Disc]] and a Chinese made format called [[Enhanced Versatile Disc|EVD]].  Both appear to have been abandoned {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}by their respective developers.

{{note|HDMC_table_note_a}}'''a''' These maximum storage capacities apply to currently released media as of January 2012.  First two layers of Blu-ray have a 25 GB capacity, but the triple layer disc adds a further 50 GB making 100 GB total.  The fourth layer adds a further 28 GB. &lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_b}}'''b''' All HD DVD players are required to decode the two primary channels (left and right) of any Dolby TrueHD track;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdprg.com/jpn/about/hddvd/page04.html HD DVD Promotion Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdforum.org/images/DVD-Forum-070605_ENG_rev110.pdf DVD Forum.org HD DVD Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; however, every Toshiba made stand-alone HD DVD player released thus far decodes 5.1 channels of TrueHD.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_c}}'''c''' On November 1, 2007 Secondary video and audio decoder became mandatory for new Blu-ray Disc players when the [[Blu-ray Disc#Player profiles|Bonus View]] requirement came into effect. However, players introduced to the market before this date can continue to be sold without Bonus View.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_d}}'''d''' There are some differences in the implementation of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) on the two formats. On Blu-ray Disc, DD+ can only be used to extend a primary Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 audiotrack.  In this method 640 kbit/s is allocated to the primary DD 5.1 audiotrack (which is independently playable on players that do not support DD+), and up to 1 Mbit/s is allocated for the DD+ extension. The DD+ extension is used to replace the rear channels of the DD track with higher fidelity versions, along with adding additional channels for 6.1/7.1 audiotracks. On HD DVD, DD+ is used to encode all channels (up to 7.1), and no legacy DD track is required since all HD DVD players are required to decode DD+.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_e}}'''e'''  On PAL DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 50 interlaced frames per second and gets replayed 4% faster. This process can be reversed to retrieve the original 24 frame per second content. On NTSC DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 60 interlaced frames per second using a process called [[Telecine#DVDs|3:2 pulldown]], which if done properly can also be reversed.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_f}}'''f''' As of July 2008, about 66.7% of Blu-ray discs are region free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics |accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_g}}'''g''' DVD supports any valid [[MPEG-2]] refresh rate as long as it is packaged with metadata converting it to 576i50 or 480i60, This metadata takes the form of REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD instructions embedded in the MPEG-2 stream itself, and is a part of the MPEG-2 standard. HD DVD is the only high-def disc format that can decode 1080p25 while Blu-ray and HD DVD can both decode 1080p24 and 1080p30. 1080p25 content can only be presented on Blu-ray as 1080i50.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_h}}'''h''' Linear PCM is the only lossless audio codec that is mandatory for both HD DVD and Blu-ray disc players, only HD DVD players are required to decode two lossless sound formats and those are Linear PCM and Dolby TrueHD. Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio have become sound format of choice for many studios on their Blu-ray titles but ever since Blu-ray won the format war, it has not become clear if they are now Mandatory for all new Blu-ray disc players since the end of the format war.

===Capacity/codecs===
Blu-ray Disc has a higher maximum disc capacity than HD DVD (50&amp;nbsp;GB vs. 30&amp;nbsp;GB for a double layered disc). In September 2007 the [[DVD Forum]] approved a preliminary specification for the triple-layer 51GB HD DVD (ROM only) disc though Toshiba never stated whether it was compatible with existing HD DVD players. In September 2006 [[TDK]] announced a prototype Blu-ray Disc with a capacity of 200GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=94|title=TDK Develops Blu-ray Media with 200GB Capacity}}&lt;/ref&gt; TDK was also the first to develop a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=46TDK|title=Develops 2X, 100GB Blu-ray Disc Prototype}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 Hitachi developed a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB. Hitachi has stated that current Blu-ray drives would only require a few firmware updates in order to play the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=559|title=Hitachi Develops BD-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual-layer Blu-ray Disc release was the movie ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', which was released on October 10, 2006. As of July 2008, over 95% of Blu-ray movies/games are published on 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs with the remainder on 25&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref name="Blhu-rayStats"&gt;[http://www.blu-raystats.com/stats.php Blu-ray stats]&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of HD DVD movies are published on 30&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs, with the remainder on 15&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/releasedates_historical.html ''Frequently updated list of historical release dates and disc capacities''], HD DVD NEWS, High-Def Digest, 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdstats.com/index.php ''HD DVD Statistics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014221902/http://hddvdstats.com/index.php |date=2007-10-14 }}, HDDVDstats.com, 15 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of video compression technology (codec) complicates any comparison of the formats.  Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD both support the same three video compression standards: [[MPEG-2]], [[VC-1]] and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]], each of which exhibits different bitrate/noise-ratio curves, visual impairments/artifacts, and encoder maturity. Initial Blu-ray Disc titles often used MPEG-2 video, which requires the highest average [[bitrate]] and thus the most space, to match the picture quality of the other two video codecs. As of July 2008 over 70% of Blu-ray Disc titles have been authored with the newer compression standards: AVC and VC-1.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; HD DVD titles have used VC-1 and AVC almost exclusively since the format's introduction. [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]], which used to release movies in both formats prior to June 1, 2007, often used the same encode (with VC-1 codec) for both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, with identical results.  In contrast, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] used different encodings: initially MPEG-2 for early Blu-ray Disc releases, VC-1 for early HD DVD releases, and eventually AVC for both formats.

Whilst the two formats support similar audio codecs, their usage varies. Most titles released on the Blu-ray format include [[Dolby Digital]] tracks for each language in the region, a [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] track for all [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Sony Pictures]] and many upcoming Universal titles, [[Dolby TrueHD]] for Disney and Sony Pictures and some Paramount and Warner titles, and for many Blu-ray titles a [[Pulse-code modulation|Linear PCM]] track for the primary language.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; On the other hand, most titles released on the HD DVD format include [[Dolby Digital Plus]] tracks for each language in the region, and some also include a [[Dolby TrueHD]] track for the primary language.

===Interactivity===

Both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD have two main options for interactivity (on-screen menus, bonus features, etc.).

HD DVD's Standard Content is a minor change from standard DVD's subpicture technology, while Blu-ray's BDMV is completely new. This makes transitioning from standard DVD to Standard Content HD DVD relatively simple {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}—for example, Apple's [[DVD Studio Pro]] has supported authoring Standard Content since version 4.0.3. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} For more advanced interactivity Blu-ray disc supports [[BD-J]] while HD DVD supports [[Advanced Content]].

===Disc construction===
Blu-ray Discs contain their data relatively close to the surface (less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) which combined with the smaller spot size presents a problem when the surface is scratched as data would be destroyed. To overcome this, TDK, Sony, and Panasonic each have developed a proprietary scratch resistant surface coating. TDK [[trademark]]ed theirs as [[Durabis]], which has withstood direct abrasion by [[steel wool]] and marring with markers in tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/01/19/tdks-durabis-2-coating-protects-200gb-blu-ray-discs/ | title=Durabis durability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HD DVD uses traditional material and has the same scratch and surface characteristics of a regular DVD. The data is at the same depth (0.6&amp;nbsp;mm) as DVD as to minimize damage from scratching. As with DVD the construction of the HD DVD allows for a second side of either HD DVD or DVD.

A study performed by Home Media Magazine (August 5, 2007) concluded that HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are essentially equal in production cost. Quotes from several disc manufacturers for 25,000 units of HD DVDs and Blu-rays revealed a price differential of only 5-10 cents. (Lowest price: 90 cents versus 100 cents.  Highest price: $1.45 versus $1.50.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/questex/hom080507/index.php|title=Indies wait for HD - Page 1 - lists bulk prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study performed by Wesley Tech (February 9, 2007) arrived at a similar conclusion.  Quotes for 10,000 discs show that a 15 gigabyte HD DVD costs $11,500 total, and 25 gigabyte Blu-ray or a 30 gigabyte HD DVD costs $13,000 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-analyzed-again/113/ | title=Blu-ray vs HD DVD replication costs analyzed again - Lists 10,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; For larger quantities of 100,000 units, the 30 gigabyte HD DVD was more expensive than the 25 gigabyte Blu-ray ($1.55 versus $1.49).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-revealed/111/|title=Blu-ray replication vs HD DVD replication costs revealed - Lists 100,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid discs===
At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], on {{start date and age|2007|1|4|df=y|paren=y}}, [[Warner Bros.]] introduced a hybrid technology, [[Total Hi Def|Total HD]], which would reportedly support both formats on a single disc. The new discs were to overlay the Blu-ray and HD DVD layers, placing them respectively {{convert|0.1|mm|um}} and {{convert|0.5|mm|um}} beneath the surface. The Blu-ray top layer would act as a two-way mirror, reflecting just enough light for a Blu-ray reader to read and an HD DVD player to ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | archivedate = 2007-01-07
  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, however, in September 2007, Warner President Ron Sanders said that the technology was on hold due to Warner being the only company who would publish on it.&lt;ref name="Twice2007"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Warner Remains Loyal To Dual HD Formats| work = TWICE| date = 2007-09-12| url = http://www.twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| accessdate = 2008-04-25| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012191226/http://twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| archivedate = 2007-10-12| author = Tarr, Greg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the original announcement, on 4 January 2008, Warner Bros. stated that it would support the Blu-ray format exclusively beginning on 1 June 2008, which, along with the demise of HD DVD the following month, ended development of hybrid discs permanently.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Copy protection===
The primary copy protection system used on both formats is the Advanced Access Content System ([[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]]). Other copy protection systems include:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Blu-ray Disc]]
! [[HD DVD]]
|-
|
*[[HDCP]] encrypted digital output
*ROM-Mark watermarking technology (physical layer)
*BD dynamic crypto ([[BD+]])
*Cinavia Digital Mark
|
*[[HDCP]] encrypted digital output
|}

===Region coding===
{{Main|Blu-ray Disc#Region_codes|l1=Blu-ray Disc - Region codes}}
The Blu-ray specification and all currently available players support region coding. As of July 2008 about 66.7% of Blu-ray Disc titles are region-free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt;

The HD DVD specification had no region coding, so a HD DVD from anywhere in the world will work in any player. The DVD Forum's steering committee discussed a request from Disney to add it, but many of the 20 companies on the committee actively opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.tech.co.uk/home-entertainment/video/dvd-hdd-players-and-receivers/blu-ray-and-hd-dvd/features/microsoft-why-hd-dvd-can-beat-blu-ray | title = Microsoft: why HD DVD can beat Blu-ray |date=2007-04-03 | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some film titles that were exclusive to Blu-ray in the United States such as Sony's ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'', Fox's ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'', were released on HD DVD in other countries due to different distribution agreements; for example, ''The Prestige'' was released outside the U.S. by once format-neutral studio [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures. Since HD DVDs had no region coding, there are no restrictions playing foreign-bought HD DVDs in an HD DVD player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119267051987662923?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Blu-ray vs. HD DVD: a Solution Abroad | work = Wall Street Journal online | author = Sarah McBride |date=2007-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2662">'''Concatenative synthesis''' is a technique for synthesising sounds by concatenating short samples of recorded sound (called ''units''). The duration of the units is not strictly defined and may vary according to the implementation, roughly in the range of 10 milliseconds up to 1 second. It is used in [[speech synthesis]] and [[Sound synthesis|music sound synthesis]] to generate user-specified sequences of sound from a database built from recordings of other sequences.

In contrast to [[granular synthesis]], concatenative synthesis is driven by an analysis of the source sound, in order to identify the units that
best match the specified criterion.&lt;ref name="schwarzsummary" /&gt;

Concatenative synthesis for music started to develop in the 2000s in particular through the work of Schwarz &lt;ref name="schwarzphd"&gt;{{Citation

The basic techniques are similar to those for speech, although with differences due to the differing nature of speech and music: for example, the segmentation is not into phonetic units but often into subunits of musical notes or events.&lt;ref name="schwarzsummary"&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">The '''Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame''', founded by the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA), honors leaders whose creativity, persistence, determination and personal charisma helped to shape the industry and made the consumer electronics marketplace what it is today. According to the CEA, the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame inductees have made a significant contribution to the world, and without these people, our lives would not be the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.org/Events/Awards/348.asp|title=CE Hall of Fame|year=2000|publisher=Consumer Electronics Association|accessdate=2008-08-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921205805/http://www.ce.org/Events/Awards/348.asp|archivedate=2008-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEA announced the first 50 inductees into the Hall of Fame at the 2000 International [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. The first class of inductees was in 2000. Each year another group of inventors, engineers, business leaders, retailers and journalists are inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.

'''Daedeok Innopolis''', formerly known as '''Daedeok Science Town''', is the research and development district in the [[Yuseong-gu]] district in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]]. Daedeok Innopolis grew out of the research cluster established by President [[Park Chunghee]] in 1973 with the opening of the [[KAIST]]. Over 20 major research institutes and over 40 corporate research centers make up this science cluster. Over the last few years, a number of IT venture companies have sprung up in this region, which has a high concentration of Ph.Ds in the applied sciences. There are 232 research and educational institutions to be found in Daejeon, many in the Daedeok region, among them the [[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute]] and the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |title=Daedeok Science Town  |accessdate=2007-02-21  |publisher=Daejeon Metropolitan City  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118140735/http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |archivedate=2006-11-18  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "town" will provide a core for the [[International Science and Business Belt]].

The Daedeok Innopolis logo was created by the industrial design company INNO Design in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], USA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12956">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''De facto'' standard}}
A '''{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard'''&lt;!-- latin expression, please preserve italics --&gt; is a custom or [[Convention (norm)|convention]] that has achieved a dominant position by public acceptance or market forces (for example, by [[first-mover advantage|early entrance to the market]]). {{Lang|la|[[De facto]]}} is a Latin phrase [[wikt:de facto|that means]] ''in fact'' (literally by or from fact) in the sense of "in practice but not necessarily ordained by law" or "in practice or actuality, but not officially established", as opposed to {{Lang|la|[[de jure]]}}.

The term {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as "{{lang|la|de jure}} standards"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one standard available for the same use.

In [[social sciences]], a voluntary standard that is also a {{lang|la|de facto}} standard is a typical solution to a [[coordination problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edna Ullmann-Margalit|title=The Emergence of Norms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FLCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=5 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-106458-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a ''de facto'' standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced "{{Lang|la|de jure}} standard" is a solution to the [[prisoner's dilemma|prisoner's problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A selection of well-known and illustrative examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} and {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards are:

* with consolidation by [[tradition|tradition of use]]:
** The [[drive side|driver's seat side]] in a given country starts as a user/industry preference, turning to a local tradition, then a [[traffic code|traffic code local norm]].
** The [[QWERTY]] system was one of several options for the layout of letters on [[typewriter]] (and later [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]) keys.  It was developed to prevent adjacent keys from jamming on early and later mechanical typewriters, often attributed to the typist's speed.&lt;ref&gt;[[QWERTY]]&lt;/ref&gt; It became a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard because it was used on the most commercially successful early typewriters and is now used on devices which have no moving parts such as [[touchscreen]]s.
** The [[MP3]] audio format started as an alternative to [[WAV]] for Internet music distribution, then replaced it&amp;nbsp;— it is now supported by the vast majority of music players, [[Portable media player|audio transport]], [[Media server|audio storage]] and noncommercial media. WAV and MP3 are also "{{Lang|la|de jure}} ISO formats".
* with consolidation by uniqueness and efficiency:
** [[HTML]] (computer file format) started as "{{Lang|la|de facto}}" (1993-1995) and became the "{{Lang|la|de jure}}" standard (1995–present day).
** [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (computer file format) was first created in 1993 by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]].  Adobe internal standards were part of its [[software quality]] systems, but they were neither published nor coordinated by a standards body.  With the [[Acrobat Reader]] program available for free, and continued support of the format, PDF eventually became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for printable documents. In 2005, [[PDF/A]] became a [[de jure standard|&lt;span lang="la"&gt;''de jure''&lt;/span&gt; standard]] as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19005-1:2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38920|title=ISO 19005-1:2005 - Document management -- Electronic document file format for long-term  preservation -- Part 1: Use of PDF 1.4 (PDF/A-1)|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Adobe's PDF 1.7 became [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 32000-1:2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51502|title=ISO 32000-1:2008 - Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 1: PDF 1.7|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/pdf/release_pdf_faq.html|title=Adobe - Release PDF for Industry Standardization FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of long-time {{Lang|la|de facto}} but never {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards (for computer file formats):
* [[AutoCAD DXF]]: a {{Lang|la|de facto}} [[ASCII|ASCII format]] for import and export of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings and fragments in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, [[XML]] based standards emerged as {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards.
* [[Microsoft]] Word [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] (over all other old [[Word processor#History|PC word processors]]): one of the best known {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards. Due to the market dominance of Word, it is supported by all office applications that intend to compete with it, typically by [[reverse engineering]] the undocumented file format. Microsoft has repeatedly internally changed the file specification between versions of Word to suit their own needs, while continuing to reuse the same file extension identifier for different versions.
* [[FITS]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] file formats, commonly used in science and engineering, with FITS traditionally used in [[astronomy]].
* [[TeX]] typesetting system, commonly used in creating scientific articles and reports for publication (in fact many journals require the publication to be fully written in TeX).

Other examples:
*Most American-made [[spark plugs]] require a {{frac|13|16}}-inch socket to remove or install. 
* The {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=on}} spacing of the rollers in a [[bicycle chain]].
* The [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC). By one year after its 1981 release, [[John Dvorak]] described the PC as rapidly becoming a "{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard microcomputer".&lt;ref name="zussman19820823"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Let's keep those systems open | work=InfoWorld | date=1982-08-23 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Zussman, John Unger | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, it gained a large share of the personal computer market. Because of the great [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], competing products like the [[Rainbow 100]] were eventually withdrawn.
* Interpreted programming languages such as [[PHP]] that have multiple implementations tend to also have a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard. In PHP's case the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is the binaries available from php.net, rather than the [[Phalanger (compiler)|Phalanger]] implementation for example.
* Use of programming languages [[R]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in data science and other science disciplines, other than computer science, where automated analysis of data is required, without system being too complicated for a persons not being professionals.

Various connectors and interconnect standards - despite being formalized and standardized, almost no product is required by law or other legal standard to use them. Examples:
* [[Phone connector (audio)|Phone connector]] (3.5mm jack), [[RCA connector|RCA]] and [[XLR connector|XLR]] connectors, used in audio industry, for connecting audio equipment, headphones, mixing consoles, microphones (often with [[phantom power]] with 48 volts in most applications), stage lightning, etc.
* [[MIDI]] connection (using so called [[DIN connector]]), electrical and protocol standard for connecting musical instruments, synthesizers, drum machines, sequencers and some audio equipment, as well [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ing them.
* [[DMX512]] (commonly just DMX) with [[XLR connector]] to control and sometimes power stage and venue lights, effects, smoke machines, laser projectors and sometimes pyrotechnics.
* [[PCI Express]] electrical and mechanical interface, and interconnect protocol used in PC computers, desktops, laptops, server, and industrial applications.
* [[GPIB]], also known as [[IEEE-488]], multi-device bus protocol, mechanical and electronic interface commonly found in electronic test equipment, i.e. digital [[multimeter]]s, [[oscilloscope|oscilloscopes]], initially created by Hewlett [[Hewlett-Packard]] as HP-IP. Commonly used with [[SCPI]] protocol.
* [[HDMI]], [[Display Port]], [[VGA]] for video, [[RS-232]] for low bandwidth serial communication.
* [[USB]] for high speed serial interface in computers and for powering or charging low power external devices (like mobile phones, headphones, portable hard drives) usually using micro USB plug and socket.
* [[Banana plugs]] in low frequency voltage and current measurements.
* [[BNC connector|BNC]] for medium frequency signal in electronic engineering testing (commonly used by signal generators, oscilloscopes, advanced multimeters and [[LCR meter|LCR meters]], [[Network analyzer (electrical)|vector network analysers]]) and sometimes in video signal (analog and digital) delivery between devices in studios and other professional settings. 
* [[AMP Incorporated|AMP]]'s AMP MATE-N-LOK / [[Molex connector|Molex]]'s Standard .093" Pin Power plug and socket, commonly used on hard drives, and other medium power devices both in PC, server, industrial applications, and others where standardized power connector for 5V and 12V is required, and off the shelf [[Power supply unit|PSU]] can be used. In embedded applications it is usually replaced with smaller square connector, that is easier to connect.
* 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pin spacing on many electronic components, including [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], [[Dual in-line- package#Single in-line|SIL]] packages, [[header connector]]s, and many more. The standard spacing enable use of these devices in prototyping boards and standardized sockets.
* [[4-20mA]] current loop standard used by sensors, transducers, amplifiers, transmission lines, control and measurement equipment.
* 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch (actual dimensions are different) hard drive standard sizes.
* [[19-inch rack]] standards for telecommunication, server, storage, audio, music, video and power equipment.
* [[ATX]] motherboard, back plane and power standards (but the intention of ATX design was to reduce number of standards, so it was not established by convention, but by biggest PC hardware and components manufacturers at the time).
* many more connectors and cables, like standardized ribbon cables medium speed and power connection between boards and devices; use of [[Registered jack|RJ45 jack]] in Ethernet switches for management purposes (instead of another de facto standard, [[RS-232]] connector); SD and microSD cards for removable storage in mobile applications like photo cameras, video recorders, phones; [[AA batteries]].

Materials and units of packaging:
* [[Solder|Soldering alloys]] in electronics, like Sn60Pb40.
* [[Aluminium alloy]]s, with most common being [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061]].
* Volumes, weights and quantities of common consumables usually follow round number of base legal units, i.e. in Europe milk is usually sold in 1 litter containers, and eggs are sold as quantity of 6.
* [[Intermodal container|Intermodal]] 48-foot container.

== Standards battles ==
There are many examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} consolidation (of a standard) by market forces and [[Invisible hand|competition]], in a [[two-sided market]], after a [[format war|dispute]]. Examples:

* [[Alternating current]] over [[direct current]]: see [[War of the currents]].
* [[VHS]] over [[Betamax]] (see  [[videotape format war]]): when the VHS format for [[videotape]] recording was introduced, other recording formats were already available in the market. Regardless of whether Betamax was superior from a technical point of view or not, the VHS format won the [[format war]] due to superior marketing tactics by its proponents. The market could not support two competing formats; VHS became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard and Betamax was eventually withdrawn.
* [[Blu-ray]] over [[HD DVD]] (see [[high definition optical disc format war]]).

Examples of standards that are "in dispute" for turns {{Lang|la|de facto}}:
* [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]'s [[OpenDocument]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[Linux]] users ([[Apache OpenOffice]], [[LibreOffice]], [[Calligra]], [[KOffice]] et al. use it as default file format)) ''vs'' Microsoft's [[Office Open XML]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[MS-Windows]] and Mac users).
* [[Adobe Flash]] ''vs'' [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG), for [[vector graphics]] [[web page]] [[animation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|The [[Lehmer sieve]] is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, specialized for  finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]]. When digital electronic computers appeared, they displaced all other kinds of computers, including [[analog computer]]s and [[mechanical computer]]s]]

In [[computer science]], a '''digital electronic computer''' is a [[computer]] machine which is both an [[electronic computer]] and a [[digital computer]]. Examples of a digital electronic computers include the [[IBM PC]], the [[Apple Macintosh]] as well as modern [[smartphone]]s. When computers that were both [[digital computer|digital]] and electronic appeared, they displaced almost all other kinds of computers, but [[computation]] has historically been performed in various non-digital and non-electronic ways: the [[Lehmer sieve]] is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, while [[analog computer]]s are examples of non-digital computers which can be electronic (with [[analog electronics]]), and [[mechanical computer]]s are examples of non-electronic computers (which may be digital or not). An example of a computer which is both non-digital and non-electronic is the ancient [[Antikythera mechanism]] found in [[Greece]]. All kinds of computers, whether they are digital or analog, and electronic or non-electronic, can be [[Turing complete]] if they have sufficient [[computer memory|memory]]. A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[programmable computer]], a [[stored program computer]], or a [[general purpose computer]], since in essence a digital electronic computer can be built for one specific application and be non-reprogrammable. As of 2014, most [[personal computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s in people's homes that use [[multicore]] [[central processing unit]]s (such as [[AMD FX]], [[Intel Core i7]], or the multicore varieties of [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based chips) are also [[parallel computer]]s using the [[MIMD]] (multiple instructions - multiple data) paradigm, a technology previously only used in digital electronic [[supercomputer]]s. As of 2014, most digital electronic supercomputers are also [[cluster computer]]s, a technology that can be used at home in the form of small [[Beowulf cluster]]s. Parallel computation is also possible with non-digital or non-electronic computers. An example of a parallel computation system using the [[abacus]] would be a group of [[human computer]]s using a number of abacus machines for computation and communicating using [[natural language]].

A digital computer can perform its operations in the [[decimal]] system, in [[binary number|binary]], in [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] or in other [[numeral system]]s. As of 2014, all digital electronic computers commonly used, whether [[personal computer]]s or [[supercomputer]]s, are working in the binary number system and also use [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]. A few [[ternary computer]]s using [[ternary logic]] were built mainly in the [[Soviet Union]] as research projects.

A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[transistorized computer]]: before the advent of the [[transistor]], computers used [[vacuum tube]]s. The transistor enabled electronic computers to become much more powerful, and recent and future developments in [[digital electronics]] may enable humanity to build even more powerful electronic computers. One such possible development is the [[memristor]].

People living in the beginning of the 21st century use digital electronic computers for [[computer storage|storing]] [[data]], such as [[photograph|photo]]s, [[music]], [[document]]s, and for performing complex mathematical computations or for communication, commonly over a worldwide [[computer network]] called the [[internet]] which connects many of the world's computers.  All these activities made possible by digital electronic computers could, in essence, be performed with non-digital or non-electronic computers if they were sufficiently powerful, but it was only the combination of electronics technology with digital computation in binary that enabled humanity to reach the computation power necessary for today's computing. Advances in [[quantum computing]], [[DNA computing]], [[optical computing]] or other technologies could lead to the development of more powerful computers in the future.

Digital computers are inherently best described by [[discrete mathematics]], while analog computers are most commonly associated with [[continuous mathematics]].

The philosophy of [[digital physics]] views the [[universe]] as being digital. [[Konrad Zuse]] wrote a book known as ''[[Rechnender Raum]]'' in which he described the whole universe as one all-encompassing computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1614">A '''discrete system''' is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to [[computational theory]]. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise [[mathematical models]].

A [[computer]] is a [[finite state machine]] that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at [[discrete time]] intervals.

The purpose of '''electro-mechanical modeling''' is to model and [[Computer simulation|simulate]] an [[electro-mechanical]] system, such that its physical parameters can be examined before the actual system is built. Parameter estimation and physical realization of the overall system is the major design objective of Electro-Mechanical modeling. Theory driven mathematical model can be used or applied to other system to judge the performance of the joint system as a whole. This is a well known &amp; proven technique for designing large control system for industrial as well as academic multi-disciplinary complex system. This technique is also being employed in MEMS technology recently.

==Different types of mathematical modelling==

The modeling of purely mechanical systems is mainly based on the Lagrangian which is a function of the generalized coordinates and the associated velocities. If all forces are derivable from a potential, then the time behavior of the dynamical systems is completely determined. For simple mechanical systems, the Lagrangian is defined as the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

There exists a similar approach for electrical system. By means of the electrical co-energy and well defined power quantities, the equations of motions are uniquely defined. The currents of the inductors and the voltage drops across the capacitors play the role of the generalized coordinates. All constraints, for instance caused by the Kirchhoff laws, are eliminated from the considerations. After that, a suitable transfer function is to be derived from the system parameters which eventually governs the behavior of the system.

In consequence, we have quantities (kinetic and potential energy, generalized forces) which determine the mechanical part and quantities (co-energy, powers) for the description of the electrical part. This offers a combination of the mechanical and electrical parts by means of an energy approach. As a result, an extended Lagrangian format is produced.

'''Factum Arte''' is a company based in [[Madrid]], [[Milan]], and [[London]] that seeks to construct a bridge between new technologies and craft skills in the conservation of [[cultural heritage]] and in [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schaffer, "What does Digitality do to the Arts?", in "the Miracle of Cana: The Originality of the Reproduction", Cini Foundation and Cierre Edizioni, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By using various forms of high-definition [[3D scanners]], Factum Arte has been able to record, in digital form using non-contact equipment, a number of endangered sites/objects of cultural importance.&lt;ref name="factum-arte.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factum-arte.com/ind/2/Conservation |title=Conservation |publisher=Factum Arte |date= |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in conjunction with the [[Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation]], which seeks to promote the use of non-contact 3D scanners to record museum collections and historic monuments, especially in areas where they are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation, http://www.factumfoundation.org/pag/198/The-Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to recording objects, Factum Arte is able to use the digital data to create an exact [[facsimile]] of the object on a scale of 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;Factum Arte, [http://www.factum-arte.com/aboutus], ‘factum-arte.com’&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Factum Arte completed the installation of an exact facsimile of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[Luxor]], near [[Howard Carter]]’s house. The facsimile, and its proximity to the original tomb, is intended to provoke a debate about preservation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2613b3e2-c5df-11e3-a7d4-00144feabdc0.html | title=Fit for a king: Tutankhamun’s replica burial chamber | publisher=The Financial Times Ltd. | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Aspden, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2616973/Replica-Tutankhamun-tomb-opens-public-bid-slow-irreversible-damage-original.html | title=Replica Tutankhamun tomb opens in bid to slow down irreversible damage to the original caused by tourists' BREATH | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. | date=30 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Travelmail Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.campbellsci.co.uk/king-tut-tomb-monitoring | title=Egypt: Preserving King Tut's Tomb Campbell datalogger controls monitoring of conditions at Tutankhamen site | publisher=Campbell Scientific United Kingdom | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Factum Arte’s Director, Adam Lowe, was said: "The tomb of Tutankhamun was built to last for eternity, but it wasn’t built to be visited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inside3dp.com/creating-exact-replica-pharaoh-tutankhamuns-tomb-3d-printing/ | title=Creating an exact replica of Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s Tomb with 3D printing | publisher=Inside3DP.com | date=19 October 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Daveys, Janey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Factum Arte has worked with institutions such as the [[British Museum]] in London, the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris, the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin, the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid, and the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in Egypt. In addition to its work in the field of cultural heritage, Factum Arte also assists a wide range of contemporary artist in creating technically difficult and innovative works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/aboutus | title=What is Factum Arte? | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Factum Arte was founded in 2001 by the artists [[Adam Lowe]], [[Manuel Franquelo]], with [[Fernando Garcia-Guereta]] to facilitate the recording of the Tomb of [[Seti I]] and works with a number of artists including [[Marc Quinn]] and [[Anish Kapoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Factum-arte.com/art&lt;/ref&gt; The Seti project involved the design and construction of 3D laser scanners, software, and photographic equipment to record the walls of the tomb at high-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/we-made-it/we-made-it-factum-arte | title=We Made It: Factum Arte Recreating a facsimile of Tutankhamun’s tomb and a painting by Veronese is all part of revolutionising our experience of art | publisher=The Arts Desk Ltd. | date=19 December 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Hallet, Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Historical Projects==

===Tomb of Seti I===
Factum Arte was founded in 2001 in order to facilitate the development of technology needed specifically for the recording of the Tomb of Seti I.

Seti’s tomb is regarded by many as the most visually impressive, and historically important tomb in the Valley of the Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelinstyle.com/egypt-tours/tomb-mighty-pharaoh-seti/ |title=Tomb of the Mighty Pharaoh Seti I |publisher=Nubian Nile Cruises, Inc. |accessdate=19 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730182803/http://travelinstyle.com/egypt-tours/tomb-mighty-pharaoh-seti/ |archivedate=30 July 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovered by [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]] in October 1817, the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I is the longest and one of the most decorated tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Despite being in excellent condition on its discovery, the tomb is currently closed to visitors to the Valley due to its deteriorating condition over the years. In addition to the removal of wall panels, and the loss of paint due to 19th century plaster casts, the tomb has suffered from collapses and cracks due to expeditions searching for hidden chambers in the 1950s and 60s that caused changes in the moisture levels of the surrounding rock.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Romer (Egyptologist)|Romer, John]]; Romer, Elizabeth, 1993, "The Rape of Tutankhamun", Michael Mara Books Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of [[Thutmose III]]===
Factum Arte was commissioned by United Exhibits Group to make a 1:1 facsimile of the Tomb of [[Thutmose III]] in 2002. The facsimile was toured at exhibitions in various museums in the United States between November 2002 and December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/31/Facsimile-of-the-Tomb-of-Thutmose-III | title=Facsimile of the Tomb of Thutmose III | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 a second facsimile of the tomb was exhibited in Madrid, Edinburgh, and Basel titled Immortal Pharaoh: The Tomb of Thutmose III (Edinburgh) and The Tomb of Thutmose III: The Dark Hours of the Sun (Madrid and Basel).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Leicht, "Reise Durch den Verborgenen Raum", https://www.bibelwerk.de/sixcms/media.php/169/WUB_406_Auf%20den%20Spuren%20Jesu%201_Rep.pdf, bibelwerk.de, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tomb of Thutmose III is the oldest complete version of the narrative of the Egyptian [[Amduat]], the journey the Sun God takes through the hours of the night.

===Tomb of Tutankhamun===
The facsimile of the tomb was installed briefly outside the [[Conrad Hotel]] in Cairo for the EU-Egypt Business and Tourism Summit and was unveiled by [[Catherine Ashton]] the European [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs]] in November 2012 as a gift to the people of Egypt, coinciding with the 90th anniversary of the tomb’s discovery.&lt;ref&gt;EU-Egypt Taskforce – Co-chairs Conclusions, http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/133511.pdf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Ashton Unveils Replica Tomb of Tutankhamun at Start of EU-Egypt Taskforce", http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/133448.pdf, European Union, 13 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21565918-technology-service-history-toot-toot-king-tut?fsrc=scn/gp/wl/pe/kingtutstomb | title=Toot toot, King Tut Technology in the service of history | publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2014 Factum Arte installed the facsimile in the Valley of the Kings, beside Howard Carter’s house, the consultant of the construction site where the facsimile was installed was "[http://www.walycenter.org/ Tarek Waly center architecture and heritage]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/789/The-Theban-Necropolis-Preservation-Initiative|title=Factum Arte :: The Theban Necropolis Preservation Initiative|last=S.L.|first=Factum Arte,|website=www.factum-arte.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walycenter.org/en/heritage-planning/10-heritage-planning/211-facsimile-of-tutankhamuns-tomb|title=Facsimile of Tutankhamun's Tomb {{!}} Tarek Waly Center|last=Administrator|website=www.walycenter.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unveiled by the Minister of Antiquities [[Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa|Mohamed Ibrahim]], the Minister for Tourism [[Hisham Zazou]], the Governor of [[Luxor]] [[Tarek Saad el Din]] and EU Ambassador [[James Moran (diplomat)|James Moran]]. The aim of the facsimile is to inform visitors to the valley about the importance of preservation and to promote awareness about the degrading state of the tombs since their opening to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pastpreservers.com/official-opening-of-the-facsimile-of-king-tutankhamuns-tomb/ | title=Official Opening of the Facsimile of King Tutankhamun’s Tomb | publisher=Past Preservers/Aegaeus | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/egypt-unveils-exact-replica-of-tutankhamuns-tomb-made-with-a-3d-printer-9307882.html | title=Egypt Unveils Exact Replica of Tutankhamun's Tomb Made with a 3D Printer | publisher=Independent | date=30 April 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Burrell, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Egyptologist [[Nicholas Reeves]] published a paper in which he hypothesised the presence of the tomb of [[Nefertiti]] as being behind one of the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb. Reeves' based his theory on markings he observed on the wall in the data recorded by Factum Arte.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y2CFJ1DAQg, 3 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|Ahram]]'' reported that initial examinations had confirmed the existence of the wall markings observed by Reeves in Factum Arte's data.&lt;ref name="english.ahram.org.eg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/9/147582/Heritage/Anticipation-grows-at-possibility-of-Tutankhamun-t.aspx | title=Anticipation Grows at Possibility of Tutankhamun Tomb's Hidden Chambers | publisher=Ahram Online | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=El-Aref, Nevine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same article reported that the results of further examinations would be published on 4 November 2015; the same day that the tomb was discovered in 1922.&lt;ref name="english.ahram.org.eg"/&gt;

===Throne Room of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]===
In 2004, during the [[Iraq War|Second Gulf War]], Factum Arte and Danish company [[United Exhibits Group]] (UEG) embarked on a project to record, and create a facsimile of the throne room of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] in the ancient city of [[Nimrud]]. Fragments of the throne room exist in the collections of various museums in Europe and the United States. Factum Arte was given permission to record these fragments in the British Museum, the Pergamon in Berlin, Dresden, Harvard, and Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;Factum-Arte.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, at the time, Iraq was considered too dangerous to send a team out to record the remaining fragments in Nimrud. In 2015 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] militants in Northern Iraq destroyed much of the remaining artwork in the ruins of the palace of Nimrud. While recording these fragments in 2005 would not have prevented their destruction by ISIS, it would have kept avenues open to further in-depth study through the high-resolution 3D data, and presented the possibility of reuniting the fragments in the form of facsimile.

===The Wedding Feast at Cana===
In November 2007, Factum Arte’s facsimile of ''[[The Wedding at Cana|The Wedding Feast at Cana]]'' (1563), by [[Paolo Veronese]], was presented by the [[Cini Foundation]] in the original location of the painting, the [[Andrea Palladio]]'s refectory for the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b851d86c-f4c3-11e2-a62e-00144feabdc0.html | title=Conservation: Factum Arte Remaking History | publisher=The Financial Times Ltd. | date=26 July 2013 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Jobey, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting, commissioned in 1562, was plndered by the [[French Revolutionary Army]] of Napoleon in 1797 and sent to the Louvre Museum, where it hangs opposite the [[Mona Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/wedding-feast-cana | title=The Wedding Feast at Cana | publisher=The Louvre | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facsimile was commissioned in 2006 by the Fondazione Giorgio Cini and, following an agreement with the Louvre, Factum Arte’s technicians were allowed to scan the painting at night. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' called the facsimile a "turning point in art".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===[[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]===
In 2010 the Cini Foundation commissioned the visualisation and manufacture of objects designed by the 18th century artist and antiquarian [[Giambattista Piranesi]]. The project was conceived by Adam Lowe, [[Michele de Lucchi]], and [[John Wilton-Ely]] and was exhibited in the Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore for the [[Venice Biannale]]. The objects were later toured for exhibitions in Madrid, Barcelona, and San Diego&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Navarro, "Piranesi Contemporáneo", www.elcultural.es, 4 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Chute, "Seeing History Through Piranesi’s Eyes", San Diego Union-Tribune, 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In March–May 2014, Factum Arte exhibited the series at the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Sir John Soane Museum]] in London. Diverse Manieri: Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess aimed to explore the relationship between [[Sir John Soane]] and Piranesi. The objects were shown in the context of prints, drawings and books in Soane’s library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/06/giovanni-piranesi-fantasy-and-excess-review | title=Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess Review: Where Imagination and Reality Collide | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | date=6 March 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Jones, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Soane Museum, {{cite web|url=http://www.soane.org/u/press/Press_Release_Diverse_Maniere_Sir_John_Soanes_Museum.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915124118/http://www.soane.org/u/press/Press_Release_Diverse_Maniere_Sir_John_Soanes_Museum.pdf |archivedate=15 September 2015 |df=dmy }} "Diverse Manieri Press Release", December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The objects were visualised in digital form from Piranesi’s designs and then rematerialized in three dimensions in the materials specified in the design. The manufacture of the objects involved a variety of methods including [[stereo-lithography]], [[Milling (machining)|milling]], [[fused deposition modelling]], [[electro forming]] and [[electro plating]], in addition to a host of moulding and casting technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/598/Diverse-Maniere--Piranesi--Fantasy-and-Excess | title=Diverse Maniere: Piranesi, Fantasy and Excess | publisher=Gobierno de España  Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25233-how-3d-printers-forge-new-art-from-old-etchings.html#.VVxK-ql5bq | title=How 3D Printers Forge New Art From Old Etchings | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. | date=17 March 2014 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Ings, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Lowe, "Messing About with Masterpieces: New Work by Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778)", http://www.factum-arte.com/lib/kcfinder/upload/files/articles/30.pdf, original article in Art in Print, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polittico Griffoni===
The 16 panels of the [[Polittico Griffoni]] once formed the altarpiece of the [[Basilica of San Petronio]] in Bologna. It was considered one of the greatest altarpieces of the 15th Century Bolognese School. The panels were originally painted by [[Francesco del Cossa]] and [[Ercole De Roberti]]. The panels, removed in 1725, are now scattered in various museums in Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the Vatican City.&lt;ref name="factum-arte1"&gt;Fabio Isman, "Il Polittico Griffoni da Bologna al Mundo", http://www.factum-arte.com/lib/kcfinder/upload/files/articles/BellItalia_marzo_2014.pdf, original article in Bell’ Italia, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the Lucida 3D scanner, designed by Manuel Franquelo, Factum Arte and the Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation collaborated with San Petronio Basilica to record, reproduce and reunite the panels as a facsimile in their original location.&lt;ref name="factum-arte1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/637/Polittico-Griffoni%3C/ref%3E | title=Polittico Griffoni Digital Technology Applied to the Re-unification of a Scattered Altarpiece | publisher=Factum Arte | accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Factum Arte has developed a number technologies in order to better facilitate the recording and production of objects.

===Examples===
*Lucida 3D Laser Scanner – Built and tested by Factum Arte’s cofounder and artist Manuel Franquelo, the Lucida system is capable of scanning surface relief, without contact, and with a depth of field of 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm at resolution of 100 microns.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Livingstone, "Mapping the Newest Old Map of the World", theawl.com, The AWL, 17 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The scanner is designed to be portable, and easy to set up and operate; with the aim to make the recording of objects and sites more feasible and accessible for both individuals and institutions.
*Cement Printer – the cement printer, designed by engineer Dwight Perry, aims to print a 3 dimensional concrete structure directly from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] files. A prototype was displayed at the GENESIS exhibition, about genetics, at the [[Centraal Museum]] in Utrecht in 2007. In 2009 the artist Anish Kapoor utilized a second prototype of the printer as an investigation into new ways of developing form. Kapoor used the results of his experimentation as a piece, entitled "Greyman Cries, Shaman Dies, Billowing Smoke, Beauty Evoked", in his solo exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London. Kapoor’s vision and process was detailed in a book ''Unconformity and Entropy'', published by Turner Books in 2010 - {{ISBN|978-8475068916}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.ca/Anish-Kapoor-Unconformity-Simon-Schaffer/dp/847506891X | title=Unconformity and Entropy | publisher=Turner Books | date=31 March 2010 | accessdate=18 July 2016 | author=Kapoor, Anish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cement printer is currently undergoing development at Factum Arte’s workshop in Madrid.

==Criticism==
In 2013, when referring to the facsimile of the Tomb of Tutankhamun and the facsimile of the caves at [[Lascaux]], historian Tom Holland voiced criticism of the idea of creating "fakes" as a means to protect the originals:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In our society, there is a huge premium set on authenticity. Clearly, were there not a difference between the copy and the original, it wouldn’t matter – you could make a replica and trash the original. Tutankhamun and Lascaux were created by people who believed in the world of the spirits, the dead, and the supernatural. You don’t have to believe in a god or gods to feel a place is consecrated and has a particular quality that cannot be reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Gee, "Which would you rather visit – a fake tomb or a real one?", https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24478909, BBC World Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8589">'''GS1 EDI''' is a set of global electronic messaging [[Technical standard|standards]] for business documents used in [[Electronic data interchange|Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI). The standards are developed and maintained by [[GS1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/ GS1 Official website]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hQeGW8M5?url=http://www.gs1.org/ |date=2009-06-10 }} Retrieved on 2015-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; GS1 EDI is part of the overall GS1 system, fully integrated with other GS1 standards, increasing the speed and accuracy of the supply chain.
Examples of GS1 EDI standards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/edi GS1 EDI] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandfield.co.nz/Services/EDI-Services/GS1 “GS1 EDI standards”, Sandfield] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; include messages such as: Order, Despatch Advice (Shipping Notice), Invoice, Transport Instruction, etc. 
The development and maintenance of all GS1 standards is based on a rigorous process called the Global Standard Management Process (GSMP). GS1 develops its global [[supply chain]] standards in partnership with the industries using them. Any organization can submit a request to modify the standard. Maintenance releases of GS1 EDI standards are typically published every two years, while code lists can be updated up to 4 times a year.

==Standards==

GS1 developed the following sets of complementary EDI standards:

*'''GS1 EANCOM'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/eancom GS1 EANCOM] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edi-plus.com/resources/message-formats/eancom/ “What is EANCOM”, EDI Plus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prozeus.de/eBusiness/standards/transaktion/eancom/index.html eBusiness-Praxis für den Mittelstand. EANCOM, Prozeus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; - a subset of [[EDIFACT|UN/EDIFACT]], which comprises a set of internationally agreed UN standards, directories and guidelines for EDI. EANCOM is fully compliant to UN/EDIFACT.
*'''GS1 XML'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/ecom-xml GS1 XML] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prozeus.de/eBusiness/standards/transaktion/eancom/index.html eBusiness-Praxis für den Mittelstand. GS1 XML, Prozeus] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrieanzeiger.de/home/-/article/26441625/26750549/Forum-eStandards-empfiehlt-GS1-XML/art_co_INSTANCE_0000/maximized/industrieanzeigermarktaktuell “Forum eStandard empfiehlt GS1-XML”, Industrie Anzeiger] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; - a GS1 set of electronic messages developed using XML, a language designed for information exchange over internet. GS1 XML is based on UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification (CCTS) and UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM).
*'''GS1 UN/XML'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/gs1-un-cefact-xml/2012 GS1 UN/XML] Retrieved on 2015-12-18&lt;/ref&gt; - GS1 has also developed its own profiles of four UN/CEFACT XML standards (Cross Industry Order, Order Response, Invoice and Despatch Advice), which are fully compliant with UN/XML.

These groups of standards are being implemented in parallel by various users, GS1 supports and maintains all of them.
GS1 EDI standards are designed to work together with other GS1 standards for the identification and labeling of goods, locations, parties and packages. This means that the information and product flows can be combined to provide business with tool enabling traceability, visibility and safety.
In EDI, it is essential to unambiguously identify products, services and parties involved in the transaction. In GS1 EDI standard messages, each product, party and location is identified by a unique GS1 identification key,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/id-keys GS1 Identification Keys] Retrieved on 2015-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.:

*products  by [[Global Trade Item Number|Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)]]
*parties, such as buyer, seller, and any third parties involved in the transaction as well as locations by [[Global Location Number|Global Location Number (GLN)]]
*logistic units by [[Serial shipping container code|Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)]]
*other GS1 ID keys, used e.g. for shipment and consignment identification

Using the GS1 ID Keys enables master data alignment between trading partners before any trading transaction takes place. This ensures data quality, eliminates errors and removes the need to send redundant information in electronic messages (such as product specifications, party addresses, etc.).

==Collaboration with other global standard organizations and industry associations==

GS1 EDI standards are developed based on other global standards, such as:

*[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] – e.g. code lists re-use
*[[UN/CEFACT]] – global methodologies applied, EDIFACT is a base for GS1 EANCOM standard
*[[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] – XML syntax

User companies are involved in the development of GS1 standards, either directly or via industry associations, such as The [[Consumer Goods Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/partners-and-sponsors/our-strategic-alliances "Our Strategic Alliances”, The Consumer Goods Forum (TCGF)] Retrieved on 2015-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation of GS1 EDI standards==

GS1 EDI standards are globally used by companies and organizations from different sectors and applied in various processes like Retail Up- and Downstream,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.nu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Standarder_2014-05.pdf Sammanställning av standarder och tillämpning för elektroniska affärer, Nätverket för Elektroniska Affärer] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Transport and Warehouse Management,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.logistiekprofs.nl/nieuws/philips-voorloper-in-standaardisatie-logistieke-interfaces Philips voorloper in standaardisatie logistieke interfaces", LogistiekProfs] Retrieved on 2015-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handelszeitung.ch/unternehmen/ikea-spart-kosten-ein “Ikea spart Kosten ein.

Men and women use [[social network service]]s (SNSs) differently and with different frequencies.  In general, several researchers have found that women tend to use SNSs more than men and for different and more social purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Historical connections==
Technologies, including communications technologies, have a long history of shaping and being shaped by the gender of their users. Although technologies used to perform housework have an apparent historical connection to gender in many cultures,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie_and_Wajcman&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald |last1=MacKenzie |first2=Judy |last2=Wajcman |title= The Social Shaping of Technology: How the Refrigerator Got its Hum |year=1985 |publisher=Open University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more ready connection to SNSs may be drawn with [[telephone]]s as a communications technology readily and widely available in the home. Telephone use has long had gendered connections ranging from the widespread assumption that women simply talk more than men, and the employment of women as [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. In particular, young women have been closely associated with extensive and trivial use of the telephone for purely social purposes.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940 |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. C. Kearney |year=2005 |title=Birds on the Wire |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=568–601 |doi=10.1080/09502380500365499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, women's use of and influence on the development of computers has been trivialized&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite journal |author=Light, J. |year=1999 |title=When Computers were Women |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=455–83 |doi=10.1353/tech.1999.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt; while significant developments in computers have been masculinized.&lt;ref name=Jonsson&gt;{{cite book |first=F. |last=Jonsson |year=2007 |chapter=The Absence of Hackerettes in the Culture of Programming | editor1-first=M. S. |editor1-last=Elm |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Sundén |title=Cyberfeminism in Northern Lights: Digital Media and Gender in a Nordic Context |pages=243–264 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea that there may be both real and perceived differences in how men and women use SNSs – and that those uses may shape the SNSs – is neither new nor surprising and has historical analogues.

There is historical and contemporary evidence that current fears about young girls' online safety have historical antecedents such as [[telegraph]]s and telephones. Further, in many cases those historical reactions resulted in restrictions of girls' use of technology to protect them from predators, molesters, and other criminals threatening their innocence. Like current fears focused on computer use, particularly SNSs and other communication media, these fears are most intense when the medium enters the home. These fears have the potential to – at least temporarily – overwhelm the positive and empowering uses of these technologies.&lt;ref name=Cassel_and_Cramer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These historical fears are echoed in contemporary media accounts of youths' use of SNSs.

Finally, the histories of some SNSs themselves have ties with gender. For example, [[gay men]] were one of the earliest groups to join and use the early SNS [[Friendster]].&lt;ref name=boyd_and_Ellison&gt;{{cite journal |first1=danah |last1=boyd |first2=Nicole |last2=Ellison |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==

===Predilection for usage===
Many studies have found that women are more likely to use either specific SNSs such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross&gt;{{cite journal|author=Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. |year=2006 |title=Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook |journal=Privacy Enhancing Technologies |pages=36–58 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gx00n8nh88252822/ |doi=10.1007/11957454_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joinson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joinson, A.

The gap in gender differences has become less apparent in LinkedIn. In 2015 about 26 percent of online men and 25% of online women used the business-and employee-oriented networking site.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who have examined the gender of users of multiple SNSs have found contradictory results. Hargittai's groundbreaking 2007 study examining race, gender, and other differences between undergraduate college student users of SNSs found that women were not only more likely to have used SNSes than men but that they were also more likely to have used many different services, including Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster; these differences persisted in several models and analyses. Although she only surveyed students at one institution – the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] – Hargittai selected that institution intentionally as "an ideal location for studies of how different kinds of people use online sites and services."&lt;ref name=Hargittai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargittai, E. |year=2007 |title=Whose space? Differences among users and non-users of social network sites |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/hargittai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, data collected by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that men were more likely to have multiple SNS profiles. Although the sample sizes of the two surveys are comparable – 1,650 Internet users in the Pew survey&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; compared with 1,060 in Hargittai's survey&lt;ref name=Hargittai /&gt; – the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population.&lt;ref name=Pew_methodology&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Information |author=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200237/http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram attract more females. Picture sharing sites overall are very popular among women. Pinterest alone attracts three times as many female users than male. Although use of Pinterest by men has increased from 5% in 2012. Facebook attracts about 77% of women online. Instagram is also more likely to attract women. Men are more likely to participate in online forums like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot. One in five men claim to be a part of an online forum.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;

===Uses===

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt; Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., &amp; Smith, A. (2007). Teens and social media. Washington, DC: Pew Internet and American Life Project. Retrieved February 27, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-andSocial-Media.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study of [[blog]]s maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs.&lt;ref name=Jones_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Jones, S., Millermaier, S., Goya-Martinez, M., &amp; Schuler, J. |year=2008 |title=Whose space is MySpace? A content analysis of MySpace profiles |journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=9 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2202/2024 |doi=10.5210/fm.v13i9.2202}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Sweden|Swedish]] SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express [[heterosexual]] behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.&lt;ref name=Sveningsson&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Sveningsson Elm, M. |year=2007 |title=Gender stereotypes and young people's presentations of relationships in a Swedish Internet community |journal=YOUNG |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=145–167 |doi=10.1177/110330880701500203}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale study of gender differences in MySpace found that both men and women tended to have a majority of female Friends, and both men and women tended to have a majority of female "Top" Friends in the site.&lt;ref name=Thelwall1&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2008 |title= Social networks, gender and friending: An analysis of MySpace member profiles |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=1321–1330 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpace_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20835}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A later study found women to author disproportionately many (public) comments in MySpace,&lt;ref name=Thelwall2&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2009 |title= Homophily in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=219–231 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpaceHomophilypreprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20978}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but an investigation into the role of emotion in public MySpace comments found that women both give and receive stronger positive emotion.&lt;ref name=Thelwall3&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M., Wilkinson, D., Uppal, S. |year=2010 |title=Data mining emotion in social network communication: Gender differences in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–199 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DataMiningEmotionSNS_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.21180}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesised that women are simply more effective at using [[social networking sites]] because they are better able to harness positive emotion.

A study focused on the influence of gender and personality on individuals’ use of online social networking websites such as Facebook, reported that men use social networking sites with the intention of forming new relationships, whereas, women use them more for relationship maintenance. (Muscanell and Guadagno, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muscanell N.L., Guadagno R.E. | year = 2012 | title = Make new friends or keep the old: Gender and personality differences in social networking use | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 107–112 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to this, women are more likely to use Facebook or MySpace to compare themselves to others and also to search for information. Men, however, are more likely to look at other people's profiles with in the intention to find friends. (Haferkamp et al., 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haferkamp N., Eimler S.C., Papadakis A.M., Kruck J.V. | year = 2012 | title = Men are from Mars, women are from Venus?

===Privacy===

[[Internet privacy|Privacy]] has been the primary topic of many studies of SNS users, and many of these studies have found differences between male and female SNS users, although some studies have found results contradictory to those found in other studies.

Some researchers have found that women are more protective of their personal information and more likely to have private profiles.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Lewis, K., Kaufman, J., &amp; Christakis, N. |year=2008 |title=The taste for privacy: An analysis of college student privacy settings in an online social network |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that women are less likely to post some types of information. Acquisti and Gross found that women in their sample were less likely to reveal their [[sexual orientation]], personal address, or cell phone number.&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt; This is similar to Pew Internet &amp; American Life research of children users of SNSs that found that boys and girls presented different views of privacy and behaviors, with girls being more concerned about and restrictive of information such as city, town, last name, and cell phone number that could be used to locate them.&lt;ref name=Lenhart_and_Madden&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenhart, A., &amp; Madden, M. |year=2007 |title=Teens, privacy &amp; online social networks |publisher=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219174827/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that "identifies them directly – last name, cell phone number, and address or home phone number," linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about "[[cyberstalking]]", "[[cyberbullying]]", and security problems.&lt;ref name=Salaway_and_Caruso /&gt;

Despite these concerns about privacy, researchers have found that women are more likely to maintain up-to-date photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=Kolek&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Kolek, E. A., &amp; Saunders, D. |title=Online disclosure: An empirical examination of undergraduate Facebook profiles |journal=NASPA Journal |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1905}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strano&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Strano, M. M. |year=2008 |title=User descriptions and interpretations of self-presentation through Facebook profile images |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |volume=2 |issue=2 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110402&amp;article=(search%20in%20Issues)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kolek and Saunders found in their sample of college student Facebook users that women were more likely to not only post a photograph of themselves in their profile but that they were more likely to have a publicly viewable Facebook account (a contradictory finding compared to many other studies), post photos, and post photo albums.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt;

Women were more likely to have: (a) a publicly viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) a photo of themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, women were more likely to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt; Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study were more likely to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that there may also be a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.&lt;ref name=Strano /&gt;

Privacy has also been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send messages either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant gender differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Roesner, F., Gill, B. T., &amp; Kohno, T. (2014). Sex, Lies, Or kittens? investigating the use of snapchat’s self-destructing messages. In ''Financial Cryptography and Data Security - 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Revised Selected Papers.'' (Vol. 8437, pp. 64-76). (Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics); Vol. 8437). Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying'''

Past research carried out to investigate if there are any gender differences in cyber-bulling has found that boys commit more cyber verbal bullying, cyber forgery and more violence based on hidden identity or presenting themselves as other person. (Sincek 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Šincek, D., 2014, January. Gender differences in cyber-bullying. In International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ARTS SGEM2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
Although men and women users of SNSs exhibit different behavior and motivations, they share some similarities. For example, one study that examined the veracity of information shared on SNSs by college students found that men and women were as likely to "provide accurate and complete information about their birthday, schedule of classes, partner's name, AIM, or political views."&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt;

In contradiction to several of the studies described above that found that women are more likely to be SNS users, at least one very reputable study has found that men and women are equally likely to be SNS users. Data gathered in December 2008 by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] showed that the SNS users in their sample were equally divided among men and women.&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; As mentioned above, the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population&lt;ref name="Pew_methodology" /&gt; than the data in much of the previously described research.

==Traditional gender roles==
Some studies have found that traditional gender roles are present in SNSs, with men in this study conforming to traditional views of [[masculinity]] and the women to traditional views of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman /&gt; Qualitative work with college student SNS users by Martínez Alemán and Wartman&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Martínez Alemán |first1=A. M. |last2=Wartman |first2=K. L. |year=2009 |title=Online social networking on campus: Understanding what matters in student culture |publisher=Routledge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Managgo ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Manago, A. M., Graham, M. B., Greenfield, P. M., &amp; Salimkhan, G. |year=2008 |title=Self-presentation and gender on MySpace |journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology |volume=29 |pages=446–458 |doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001 |issue=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have found similar results for both Facebook and MySpace users. Moreover, the work by Managgo ''et al.'' discovered not only traditional gender roles and images but sexualisation of women users of MySpace.&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al /&gt; Similarly, research into the impact of comments in the profile of a Facebook users on that user's perceived attractiveness revealed a "sexual double standard", wherein negative statements resulted in male profile owners being judged more attractive and female profile owners less attractive.&lt;ref name=Walther_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x |author=Walther, J. B., Van Der Heide, B., Kim, S., Westerman, D., &amp; Tong, S.

&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at least one study has found that men and women SNS users both left textual clues about their gender.&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;

==Other gender identities in social networking==
In February 2014, Facebook announced the vast expansion of options for choosing gender identities to list on profiles, ranging to up to 56 gender identity choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apnewsbreak-gender-options-facebook-users-22501422|title=Technology and Science News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709|title=Timeline Photos - Facebook Diversity - Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Facebook followed up with allowing gender-neutral relationship identities for identifying family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/08/28/facebook-adds-gender-neutral-family-relationship-settings|title=Facebook Adds Gender-Neutral Family Relationship Settings|author=[[Parker Marie Molloy]]|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of nanotechnology''' traces the development of the concepts and experimental work falling under the broad category of [[nanotechnology]].  Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central  concepts happened over a longer period of time.  The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 and the discovery of [[fullerene]]s in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.  The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its [[Implications of nanotechnology|potential implications]] as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and with governments moving to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology.  The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications of nanotechnology]], although these were limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] rather than the [[Disruptive technology|transformative]] applications envisioned by the field. .

== Early uses of nanomaterials ==
The earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to [[carbon nanotubes]], [[cementite]] [[nanowires]] found in the microstructure of [[wootz steel]] manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sanderson, Katharine |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html |title=Sharpest cut from nanotube sword |journal=Nature News |date=2006-11-15 |doi=10.1038/news061113-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they were used by [[artisan]]s as far back as the ninth century in [[Mesopotamia]] for creating a [[Lusterware|glittering]] effect on the surface of pots.&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiFMPmXSsLUC&amp;pg=SA2-PA1|title=Handbook of Nanophysics: Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots|last2=Hutten|first2=Andreas|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420075458|editor-last=Sattler|editor-first=Klaus D.|pages=2–1|chapter=Magnetic Nanoparticles|last1=Reiss|first1=Gunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA328|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439820094|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[pottery]] from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter. This [[Lusterware|luster]] is caused by a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a [[Glazing (window)|glazing]], which contains [[silver nanoparticle|silver]] and [[copper nanoparticle]]s dispersed homogeneously in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding [[copper]] and [[silver]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[oxide]]s together with [[vinegar]], [[ochre]], and [[clay]] on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the [[Muslim world]]. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.&lt;ref name="khan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1e79xqbRqEEC&amp;pg=PA150|title=Ceramics|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-8122-1156-6|author=Rawson, Philip S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] lectured, "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]," at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting at [[Caltech]] on December 29, 1959, which is often held to have provided inspiration for the field of [[nanotechnology]]. Feynman had described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, [[surface tension]] and [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals attraction]] would become more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gribbin |first1=John |last2= Gribbin |first2=Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Dutton |year=1997 |page=170 |isbn= 978-0-452-27631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of nanotechnology have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. [http://www.christoumey.org/ Chris Toumey], a [[cultural anthropologist]] at the [[University of South Carolina]], found that the published versions of Feynman’s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] was invented in 1981.  Subsequently, interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves via computer control instead of control by a human operator; and in a cover article headlined "Nanotechnology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= "Nanotechnology" / "Tinytech" | page= 56 |journal=Omni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]''.  Toumey’s analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Toumey |title=Apostolic Succession |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |volume=1/2 |year=2005 |pages=16–23|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4129/1/Succession.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Toumey |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |title=Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science |journal=Techné |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=133–168 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919171108/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman’s “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman. Feynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.&lt;ref name=Milburn&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Milburn |title=Nanovision: Engineering the Future |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8223-4265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norio Taniguchi===
{{main article|Norio Taniguchi}}

The Japanese scientist called Norio Taniguchi of [[Tokyo University of Science]] was        first to use the term "nano-technology" in a 1974 conference,&lt;ref name = "Taniguchi"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Norio |last=Taniguchi |title=On the Basic Concept of 'Nano-Technology' |journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Production Engineering, Tokyo, 1974, Part II |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe semiconductor processes such as thin film deposition and ion beam milling exhibiting characteristic control on the order of a nanometer.  His definition was, "'Nano-technology' mainly consists of the processing of, separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or one molecule."  However, the term was not used again until 1981 when Eric Drexler, who was unaware of Taniguchi's prior use of the term, published his first paper on nanotechnology in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Guston|editor1-first=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of nanoscience and society|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=9781452266176|page=747|chapter-url={{Google books|vyp1AwAAQBAJ||page=747|plainurl=true}}|accessdate=3 August 2014|chapter=Taniguchi, Norio|first=Deborah R.|last=Bassett}}&lt;!--alt url: https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/file/download/1c6f06663d588d421e4eafcee2e159803734b0f3b6968be73bb6cee1c0fa55eb --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koodali|first1=Ranjit T.|last2=Klabunde|first2=Kenneth J.|editor1-last=Kent|editor1-first=James A.|title=Handbook of industrial chemistry and biotechnology, volume 1|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461442592|page=250|edition=12th|chapter-url={{Google books|7VxDAAAAQBAJ||page=250|plainurl=true}}|accessdate=3 August 2014|chapter=Nanotechnology: Fandamental Principles and Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard|first1=edited by Graeme A.

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]
{{main article|Eric Drexler}}

In the 1980s the idea of nanotechnology as a [[deterministic]], rather than [[stochastic]], handling of individual atoms and molecules was conceptually explored in depth by K. Eric Drexler, who promoted the technological significance of nano-scale phenomena and devices through speeches and two influential books.
 
In 1980, Drexler encountered Feynman's provocative 1959 talk "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" while preparing his initial scientific paper on the subject, “Molecular Engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation,” published in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=348724 |year=1981 |author1=Drexler |first1=K.

He also first published the term "[[grey goo]]" to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating machine, capable of independent operation, were constructed and released.  Drexler's vision of nanotechnology is often called "[[Molecular Nanotechnology]]" (MNT) or "molecular manufacturing."

His 1991 Ph.D. work at the [[MIT Media Lab]] was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and (after some editing) his thesis, "Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/27999/1/25696817.pdf |last=Drexler |first=K.

Drexler founded the [[Foresight Institute]] in 1986 with the mission of "Preparing for nanotechnology.”  Drexler is no longer a member of the Foresight Institute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Experimental advances ==

Nanotechnology and [[nanoscience]] got a boost in the early 1980s with two major developments: the birth of [[Cluster (physics)|cluster]] science and the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM). These developments led to the discovery of [[fullerenes]] in 1985 and the structural assignment of [[carbon nanotubes]] a few years later

===Invention of scanning probe microscopy===
{{double image|right|Gerd Binnig sw.jpg|175|Rohrer.jpg|200|Gerd Binnig (left) and Heinrich Rohrer (right) won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their 1981 invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]].}}

The [[scanning tunneling microscope]], an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level, was developed in 1981 by [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] at [[IBM Zurich Research Laboratory]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Binnig"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=G. |last1=Binnig |first2=H. |last2=Rohrer|title=Scanning tunneling microscopy|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=30|issue=4|year=1986|pages=355–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=15 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binnig, [[Calvin Quate]] and [[Christoph Gerber]] invented the first [[atomic force microscope]] in 1986. The first commercially available atomic force microscope was introduced in 1989.

[[IBM]] researcher [[Don Eigler]] was the first to manipulate atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope in 1989. He used 35 [[Xenon]] atoms to [[IBM (atoms)|spell out the IBM logo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|title=IBM's 35 atoms and the rise of nanotech|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-10362747-264.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He shared the 2010 [[Kavli Prize]] in Nanoscience for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kavli Prize Laureates 2010|url=http://www.kavliprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=45348|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512070336/http://www.kavliprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=45348|archivedate=12 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advances in interface and colloid science===
[[Interface and colloid science]] had existed for nearly a century before they became associated with nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Efremov |first=I.F. |chapter=Periodic Colloidal Structures |title=Surface and Colloid Science |volume=8 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |editor=Matijevic, E. |year=1976 |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/series/6505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyklema |first=J. |title=Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science |publisher=Academic Press |year=2000 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.agents/675463/description |isbn=978-0-12-460523-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first observations and size measurements of nanoparticles had been made during the first decade of the 20th century by [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]], winner of the 1925 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], who made a detailed study of gold sols and other [[nanomaterials]] with sizes down to 10&amp;nbsp;nm using an [[ultramicroscope]] which was capable of visualizing particles much smaller than the [[light]] [[wavelength]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zsigmondy |first=R. |title=Colloids and the Ultramicroscope |publisher=J.Wiley and Sons |location=New York |year=1914 |url=https://archive.org/details/colloidsandultr00alexgoog |accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zsigmondy was also the first to use the term "nanometer" explicitly for characterizing particle size.  In the 1920s, [[Irving Langmuir]], winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and [[Katharine B. Blodgett]] introduced the concept of a [[monolayer]], a layer of material one molecule thick.  In the early 1950s, Derjaguin and Abrikosova conducted the first measurement of surface forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/DF9541800024 |title=Investigations of the forces of interaction of surfaces in different media and their application to the problem of colloid stability |year=1954 |last1=Derjaguin |first1=B.

In 1974 the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] for depositing uniform thin films one atomic layer at a time was developed and patented by Tuomo Suntola and co-workers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Atomic Layer Deposition|url=http://www.fmnt.fi/index.pl?id=2913&amp;isa=Category&amp;op=show|publisher=Finnish Micro &amp; Nano Technology Network|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172218/http://www.fmnt.fi/index.pl?id=2913&amp;isa=Category&amp;op=show|archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another development, the synthesis and properties of semiconductor [[nanocrystal]]s were studied. This led to a fast increasing number of [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles of [[quantum dots]].

===Discovery of fullerenes===

[[Fullerene]]s were discovered in 1985 by [[Harry Kroto]], [[Richard Smalley]], and [[Robert Curl]], who together won the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight [[mass spectrometry]].  As a consequence of this expertise, Curl introduced him to Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust.  These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and the fullerenes as the third [[allotropy|allotropic]] form of carbon.  Subsequent discoveries included the [[endohedral fullerenes]], and the larger family of fullerenes the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/318162a0 |title=C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: Buckminsterfullerene |year=1985 |last1=Kroto |first1=H.

In the early 1990s Huffman and Kraetschmer, of the [[University of Arizona]], discovered how to synthesize and purify large quantities of fullerenes.  This opened the door to their characterization and functionalization by hundreds of investigators in government and industrial laboratories.  Shortly after, rubidium doped C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be a mid temperature (Tc = 32 K) superconductor.  At a meeting of the Materials Research Society in 1992, Dr. T. Ebbesen (NEC) described to a spellbound audience his discovery and characterization of carbon nanotubes.  This event sent those in attendance and others downwind of his presentation into their laboratories to reproduce and push those discoveries forward.  Using the same or similar tools as those used by Huffman and Kratschmer, hundreds of researchers further developed the field of nanotube-based nanotechnology.

===National Nanotechnology Initiative===
[[File:Mihail Roco.jpg|thumb|Mihail Roco of the [[National Science Foundation]] formally proposed the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]], and was a key architect in its initial development.]]

{{main article|National Nanotechnology Initiative}}

The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a [[United States]] federal nanotechnology [[research and development]] program. “The NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NNI {{!}} Nano|url=http://nano.gov/about-nni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goals are to advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) program, foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit, develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology, and support responsible development of nanotechnology.  The initiative was spearheaded by [[Mihail Roco]], who formally proposed the National Nanotechnology Initiative to the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] during the Clinton administration in 1999, and was a key architect in its development.  He is currently the Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology at the [[National Science Foundation]], as well as the founding chair of the [[National Science and Technology Council]] subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;

President [[Bill Clinton]] advocated [[nanotechnology]] development. In a 21 January 2000 speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Clinton's Address to Caltech on Science and Technology |url=http://marcomm.caltech.edu/events/presidential_speech/|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Clinton said, "Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government."  Feynman's stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, as mentioned in President Clinton's speech:

"Why the future doesn't need us" is an article written by [[Bill Joy]], then Chief Scientist at [[Sun Microsystems]], in the April 2000 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine. In the article, he argues that "Our most powerful 21st-century technologies — [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] — are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]]." Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]]. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the [[nuclear bomb]], were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such [[dystopian]] scenarios as [[cybernetic revolt|robot rebellion]]. He notably quotes the [[Unabomber]] on this topic.  After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.

In the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article titled ''A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists'', Bill Joy was criticized for having technological tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 December 2003 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |author="Brown, John Seely and Duguid, Paul" }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking "Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?".

===''Prey''===

{{Main article|Prey (novel)}}

''Prey'' is a 2002 novel by [[Michael Crichton]] which features an artificial swarm of nanorobots which develop intelligence and threaten their human inventors.  The novel generated concern within the nanotechnology community that the novel could negatively affect public perception of nanotechnology by creating fear of a similar scenario in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drexler–Smalley debate===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|Richard Smalley, a co-discoverer of the fullerenes, was involved in a public debate with Eric Drexler about the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s.]]
{{main article|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

Richard Smalley, best known for co-discovering the soccer ball-shaped “buckyball” molecule and a leading advocate of nanotechnology and its many applications, was an outspoken critic of the idea of [[molecular assembler]]s, as advocated by Eric Drexler.  In 2001 he introduced scientific objections to them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacking the notion of universal assemblers in a 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article, leading to a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] later that year from Drexler and colleagues,&lt;ref name="smalleyresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K.

Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to an exchange of [[open letter]]s in 2003.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley criticized Drexler's work on nanotechnology as naive, arguing that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction.  Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.

Smalley first argued that "fat fingers" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. He believed these would exclude the possibility of "molecular assemblers" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.

Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with "molecular assemblers" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues&lt;ref name="smalleyresponse"/&gt; in a 2001 publication.  Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Drexler maintained that both were [[straw man]] arguments, and in the case of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, "...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|title=Of Chemistry, Nanobots, and Policy|url=http://crnano.org/Debate.htm|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be.  Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' carried a 4-part debate.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]] spends four pages in his book 'The Singularity Is Near' to showing that Richard Smalley's arguments are not valid, and disputing them point by point.  Kurzweil ends by stating that Drexler's visions are very practicable and even happening already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near|year=2005 |pages=193–196 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Society report on the implications of nanotechnology===

{{further|Implications of nanotechnology#Studies on the implications of nanotechnology|l1=Studies on the implications of nanotechnology}}

The [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]'s 2004 report on the implications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by [[Prince Charles]]' concerns about [[nanotechnology]], including [[molecular manufacturing]]. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Society in Denial|url=http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2004/08/royal_society_i.html|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=31 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the word "[[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]]" appears only once in the body of the report (in passing), and "molecular manufacturing" or "[[molecular nanotechnology]]" not at all.  The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology.  It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on [[grey goo]], which cites a weaker variation of [[Richard Smalley]]'s contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.

== Initial commercial applications ==
{{further|List of nanotechnology applications}}

The early 2000s saw the beginnings of the use of nanotechnology in commercial products, although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive [[nanomaterials]].  Examples include [[titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]] [[nanoparticle]]s in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; [[silver nanoparticles]] in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as [[Silver Nano]]; [[carbon nanotube]]s for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 10, 2011, the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] estimated that over 1300 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Science Foundation]] funded researcher David Berube to study the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz.  This study concludes that much of what is sold as “nanotechnology” is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a “nanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like” which will “end up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a "nano bubble" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

'''Deployment''' of '''Internet Protocol Version 6''' ([[IPv6]]), the next generation of the [[Internet Protocol]], has been in progress since the mid-2000s.

IPv6 was designed as a replacement for [[IPv4]] which has been in use since 1982, and is in the final stages of [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhausting its unallocated address space]], but still carries most Internet traffic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's statistics show IPv6 availability of its users up to 25% &lt;!-- on two Saturdays--&gt;  depending on the day of the week (more use on weekends), with use over 20% any day of the week {{as of|2018|07|alt=since July 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html|title=IPv6 – Google|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is uneven across countries and Internet service providers.

&lt;!-- when those numbers are updated, also update the main page percentages please --&gt;
In November 2016, 1491 (98.2%) of the 1519 [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access their domain name servers, and 1485 (97.8%) zones contained IPv6 [[Domain Name System|glue records]], and approximately 9.0 million domains (4.6%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table, 29.2% had IPv6 protocol support.&lt;ref name=hestat&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=RIPE NCC|title=IPv6 Enabled Networks|url=http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6?s=_ALL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Cellular telephone systems present a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service is making the transition from [[3G]] to "next-generation" [[4G]] technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service. This mandates the use of IPv6 for such networks. In 2009, the US cellular operator [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] released technical specifications for devices to operate on its "next-generation" networks.&lt;ref name="verizon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Morr|title=Verizon Mandates IPv6 Support for Next-Gen Cell Phones|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090609_verizon_mandates_ipv6_support_for_next_gen_cell_phones/|publisher=CircleID|date=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification mandates IPv6 operation according to the ''3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)'', and deprecates IPv4 as an optional capability.&lt;ref name="verizon" /&gt;

A graph of IPv6 adoption since 2008 and a map of IPv6 deployment by country are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption |title=IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption |title=Per-country IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akamai publishes by-country and by-network statistics on IPv6 adoption for traffic it sees on its global Content Distribution Network (CDN).  This set of data also shows graphs for each country and network over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-internet-ipv6-adoption-visualization.jsp |title=IPv6 adoption visualization |publisher=Akamai |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A global view into the history of the growing IPv6 routing tables can be obtained with the SixXS Ghost Route Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ |title=SixXS Ghost Route Hunter |publisher=Sixxs.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool provided a list of all allocated IPv6 prefixes until 2014 and marks with colors the ones that were actually being announced into the Internet BGP tables. When a prefix was announced, it means that the [[Internet service provider|ISP]] at least can receive IPv6 packets for their prefix.

The integration of IPv6 on existing network infrastructure may be monitored from other sources, for example:
* [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet registries]] (RIR) IPv6 prefix allocation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6?s=_ALL;s=CH;s=DE;s=JP;s=FR;s=US;s=BE;s=PE|title=IPv6 Enabled Networks|work=ripe.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPv6 testing, evaluation, and certification===
A few organizations are involved with international IPv6 test and evaluation, ranging from the United States Department of Defense to the University of New Hampshire.

* The US DoD [[Joint Interoperability Test Command]] [[DoD IPv6 Product Certification]] Program
* [[University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory]] involvement in the IPv6 Ready Logo Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv6ready.org|title=IPv6 Ready Logo Site - Home|work=ipv6ready.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Massey University]] has enabled IPv6 on its border and core campus routers. Its central network services, including DNS, external email and NTP are also enabled. Massey's main website is IPv6-enabled and remote login to some servers and network equipment also support IPv6 for systems administration and networking staff.
* IPv6 has been enabled on 15 websites hosted at [[Tauranga City Council]] (TCC). Changes to equipment on the Council’s internal LAN have also been made to enable IPV6. Some internal networks across the organisation have been enabled for IPv6, and dual-stack technology is being used to enable both IPv4 and IPv6 use. A number of internal servers and client devices communicate via IPv6, and a teredo relay and 6to4 relay ensure users using these two transition technologies are well served when accessing IPV6 addresses.
* The [[University of Auckland]] IT Services team has partially deployed IPv6, in collaboration with the Science Faculty and the Computer Science Department. It has IPv6 connectivity via [[KAREN]] and its commercial ISP. Computer Science is fully dual-stacked; IPv6 has been used in undergraduate laboratory assignments and for post-graduate projects.
* [[KAREN]], New Zealand’s R&amp;E network, is an IPv6 native network and has provided IPv6 as a standard service offering to its members since 2006.
* Auckland-based ISP WorldxChange Communications has had dual-stack since 2008. It has started providing residential customers with dual (IPv4 and IPv6) service using DHCPv6, on a trial basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wxnz.net/ipv6-trial/ |title=WXNZ IPv6 Trial |publisher=Wxnz.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the [[Association of American Publishers]] (AAP), a coalition of book and journal publishers in North America, launched the Electronic Manuscript Project, the first effort ever to develop a commercial SGML application.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt; The project sought to create a standard for document interchange that would allow the publishing industry to reap the benefits of  [[Markup language#Types|descriptive markup]], which was seen as “the most effective means of establishing a consistent method for preparing electronic manuscripts which can feed the publishing process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Association of American Publishers| first1=.|title= Electronic Manuscript Project: Task I Report | publisher=Aspen Systems |place=Rockville, MD| date= 1984| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Key participants in the project included organizations such as the [[US Library of Congress]], the American Society of Indexers, the [[IEEE]], the [[American Chemical Society]], the [[American Institute of Physics]], and the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1108/10650750310698766| issn = 1065-075X| volume = 19| issue = 4| pages = 144–148| last = Cave| first = Francis| title = Article Metadata Standards: An Historical Review| journal = OCLC Systems &amp; Services: International Digital Library Perspectives| date = 2003-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Aspen Systems Corporation was hired to conduct the work over a two-year period. Two preliminary works with restricted distribution were produced in 1985, the draft AAP DTD&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AAP| title = Association of American Publishers' Standard for Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Exchange.| location = Washington| date = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AAP| title = Author Guidelines for the Preparation, Creation and Exchange of Electronic Manuscripts| location = Washington| date = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/comjnl/29.3.193| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 193–200| last = Smith| first = Joan M.| title = The Implications of SGML for the Preparation of Scientific Publications| journal = The Computer Journal| date = 1986-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Electronic Publishing Special Interest Group (EPSIG), a consortium sponsored by the [[OCLC|Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC), recommended the DTDs developed by the Electronic Manuscript Project be used as an American Standard.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt; With the support of the AAP and the Graphic Communications Association (GCA), the recommendations were accepted and, in 1988, the AAP DTD became the [[American National Standards Institute]]'s ''Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup'' (ANSI/NISO Z39.59) standard. Being based on the [[ASCII]]  [[character encoding]] standard, it includes a large set of entity definitions for special characters.&lt;ref name="Herwijnen-1994-111" /&gt;

The AAP and EPSIG continued their collaboration and published a revised version of the specification in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Reference Manual on Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup (Version 2| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Author’s Guide to Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Markup of tabular material (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Markup of mathematical formulas (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifying three document types in the field of publishing: Book, Serial Publication, and Article, for each of which the revised specification offers a DTD.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 103–145| last1 = Goossens| first1 = Michel| last2 = Saarela| first2 = Janne| title = A practical introduction to SGML| journal = TUGboat| date = November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAP and the [[European Physical Society]] (EPS) further collaborated on a standard method for marking up tables and mathematical notation in scientific documents.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Building on this work, Eric van Herwijnen, then head of the text processing section at [[CERN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0891-2017| volume = 17| issue = 1| pages = 110–116| last = van Ess-Dkema| first = Carol| title = Review of "Practical SGML" by Eric Van Herwijnen.

The '''Industrial Revolution in Scotland''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes and economic expansion between the mid-eighteenth century and the late nineteenth century. By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707. There was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve [[agriculture in Scotland]]. New crops were introduced and [[enclosure]]s began to displace the [[run rig]] system and free pasture. The economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glass-works, breweries, and soap-works, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial center after 1815.

The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute, and woolen industries. Encouraged and subsidized by the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland|Board of Trustees]] so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. Historians often emphasize that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] Scottish entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870. As a result, Scotland became a center for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.

Scotland was already one of the most urbanized societies in Europe by 1800. Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London. [[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbor and established itself as an industrial and trading center. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. Owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class. Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841–1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were [[Scottish Canadians]] and [[Scottish American]]s as the five million remaining in Scotland.

==Background==
{{Main|Scotland in the modern era}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adam Smith]]. the "father of modern economics"]]
By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]] voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69 to adopt the [[Treaty of Union]]. It was a full economic union. Most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as "Great Britain". It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Smout, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. I: The Economic Background", ''Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 455–67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592848 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors that facilitated industrialisation in Scotland included cheap and abundant labour; natural resources that included coal, blackband [[ironstone]] and potential water power; the development of new technologies, among them the [[steam engine]] and markets that would buy Scottish products. Other factors that also contributed to the process included the improvement of transport links, which helped facilitated the movement of goods, an extensive banking system, and the widespread adoption of ideas about economic development with their origins in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"&gt;R. Finley, "4. Economy: 1770–1850 age of industrialization", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 198–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment brought the country to the front of intellectual achievement in Europe.&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;[[Arthur L. Herman|A. Herman]], ''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]'' (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0-609-80999-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific. Adam Smith developed and published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British [[economic policy]] and still frames discussions on [[globalisation]] and [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0-415-06164-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key scientific work included the discoveries of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist, [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]], [[Joseph Black]], [[physicist]] and chemist, and [[James Hutton]], the first modern [[geologist]].&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J. Repcheck, ''The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity'' (Cambridge, MA: Basic Books, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7382-0692-X}}, pp. 117–43.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the eighteenth century,&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{Citation|last=M. Magnusson |title=Review of James Buchan, ''Capital of the Mind: How Edinburgh Changed the World'' |journal=New Statesman |date=10 November 2003 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3JQonlV?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as [[James Hutton]], [[James Watt]], [[William Murdoch]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

===Agricultural revolution===
{{Main|Scottish Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:George Heriot Swanston03.jpg|thumb|right|alt=man guiding two horses pushing machine |An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by [[Patrick Bell]]]]
After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as [[John Cockburn (Scottish politician)|John Cockburn]] and [[Sir Archibald Grant, 2nd Baronet|Archibald Grant]]. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp206-7"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hay]]making was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and [[crop rotation]] were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. [[Enclosure]]s began to displace the [[Run rig|runrig]] system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers,&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly known as the [[Lowland Clearances]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-521-89167-1}}, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working [[Reaper|reaping machine]], developed by [[Patrick Bell]] in 1828. His rival [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.&lt;ref name="Sprott2011"&gt;G. Sprot, "Agriculture, 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 321–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Scottish agriculture meant that Scotland could support its increased population with food and it released labour that would take part in industrial production.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt;

===Banking===
[[File:Former British Linen Bank, St. Andrew Square Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The former headquarters of the [[British Linen Bank]] in St Andrews Square, Edinburgh]]
The first banks formed in Scotland were the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695–1995'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0757-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow with branches of its own (notably, the first was to be Dunlop, Houston &amp; Co. in 1749, known as "the Ship Bank" for the image of a ship printed on all their bills)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700–1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Cowen and R. Kroszner, "Scottish Banking before 1845: A Model for Laissez-Faire?", ''Journal of Money, Credit and Banking'', vol. 21 (2), (May, 1989), pp. 221–31, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1992370 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; As a joint-stock company the British Linen Company had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; A. Constable, 1950), {{ISBN|1446526283}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
The extensive Scottish coastline meant that few parts of the country that were not within easy reach of sea transportation, particularly the central belt that would be the heartland of industrial development. Before the eighteenth century most roads were relatively poor dirt tracks. In the late eighteenth century there were improvements carried out by [[turnpike trusts]] and the creation of a series of [[Old military roads of Scotland|military roads]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Canal building also developed, with four major lowland canals: the [[Forth and Clyde Canal|Forth and Clyde]], [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union]], [[Monkland Canal|Monkland]] and [[Crinan Canal|Crinan]] and further north the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal|Paisley]], [[Caledonian Canal|Caledonian]] and [[Aberdeenshire Canal|Inverurie]] canals, carrying thousands of passengers and tons of goods by the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Durie, "Movement, transport and tourism" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, eds, ''A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748621709}}, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exports===

With tariffs with England abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with [[Colonial America]]. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"&gt;H. Hamilton, ''An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scotland's economy had been ravaged by the [[Darien scheme]]: according to some estimates, half of all the circulating wealth in Scotland went into the scheme. Glasgow merchants had been particularly enthusiastic, and consequently had no ships of their own for twenty years following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Massie, ''Glasgow: Portraits of a City'' (Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1989), p. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow [[Tobacco Lords]] were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lester, "The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities", ''Virginia Historical Society'' Vol. 84, No. 1 (1976), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4248011?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103494003161 in JSTOR], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade had started as smuggling during the 1600s, but with the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], it became legal and trade picked up.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "The Colonial Trades and Industrial Investment in Scotland, c. 1700–1815," ''Economic History Review,'' Feb 1976, vol. 29 (1), pp. 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business,&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences," ''Economic History Review,'' April 1964 vol. 16, pp. 468–477 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592849 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "An Eighteenth-Century Business Élite: Glasgow-West India Merchants, c 1750–1815," ''Scottish Historical Review,'' April 1978, vol. 57 (1), pp. 40–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p296&gt;J. D. Mackie, B.

Since England had woolens, this meant linen.&lt;ref name=Durie1993/&gt; The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty on linen and from 1727 it received subsidies of £2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p292&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees, so that they could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref name=Durie1993&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the eighteenth century, exporting linen to England and America.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"/&gt; In 1728, 2.2 million yards of linen cloth had been produced and by 1730 it had already supplanted woollen cloth as the major manufacturing industry. By 1750 it reached 7.6 million and it peaked at 12.1 million yards in 1775. However, there were sharp slumps, particularly in the periods  1734–43 and 1763–72. It was a mainly rural industry, with most of the manufacture carried out in homes, rather than factories. It employed perhaps 100,000 people, four out of five of which were women who spun the flax, while men operated the looms.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p381"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government promoted the use of linen from the late 17th century: a 1686 Act of Parliament stated that all Scots were to be buried in Scottish-made linen winding sheets, using Scottish flax. In 1748, an embargo on the import or use of French [[cambric]] provided a further boost to the linen industry.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1770, [[Glasgow]] was the largest linen manufacturer in Britain, and in 1787, [[Calton, Glasgow]] was the site of Scotland's first industrial dispute when 7,000 weavers went on strike in protest against a 25% cut in their wages. The [[39th Foot]] were sent in, and three people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheer linen, which had then come into vogue, was almost unobtainable in Scotland in the 1780s. In a bid to stay competitive, Glasgow manufacturers turned to fine cotton muslin, at which they succeeded so well that it became cheaper than imported Indian muslins.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the popularity of Indian muslins, from the 1760s onwards, had come a fashion for [[tambour lace]], or [[sewed muslin]], which briefly became a flourishing business in Ayrshire, thanks to the enterprising spirit of [[Mrs Jamieson]].

==Nineteenth century==

The economy, long based on agriculture,&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"/&gt; began to industrialize after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the production of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cotton===
From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton. The first cotton spinning mill was opened at [[Penicuik]] in 1778. By 1787 Scotland had 19 mills, 95 by 1795 and there were 192 by 1839. The rise of cotton was the result of a sudden fall in the price of the raw materials, mostly imported from the US, and the availability of a pool of cheap labour caused by population rise and migration. In 1775 137,000&amp;nbsp;lb of raw cotton were being imported into the Clyde and by 1812 it had increased eightfold to over 11 million lb. The capital invested in the industry increased sevenfold between 1790 and 1840.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; By 1800, cotton was the main industry in the Glasgow area: [[New Lanark]] mills were at the time the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Early production was aided by the new technology of the [[spinning mule]], [[water frame]] and water power.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Steam powered machines were introduced into the industry from 1782.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; However, only about a third of workers were employed in factories and it continued to rely heavily on the [[hand loom]] weaver, working in his own home. In 1790 there were about 10,000 weavers involved in cotton manufacture and by 1800 it was 50,000.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p384"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton industry flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Henderson, ''The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861–65'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1934), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-521-57643-1}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
[[File:Francis Colliery Headgear - geograph.org.uk - 305376.jpg|thumb|left|The headgear at Francis Colliery, Fife]]
Coal mining became a major industry, and continued to grow into the twentieth century, producing the fuel to smelt iron, heat homes and factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. Coal mining expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century, reaching 700,000 tons a year by 1750. Most coal was in five fields across the [[Central Belt]]. The first [[Newcomen Steam Engine]] was introduced into a Scottish colliery in 1719, but water remained the most important source of power for most of the century. With increased demand for household fuel from a growing urban population and the emerging demands of heavy industry, production grew from an estimated 1 million tons a year in 1775, to 3 million by 1830.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp211-12"/&gt; Production almost doubled by the 1840s and peaked in 1914 at about 42 million tons a year.&lt;ref name="Whatley2001pp208-9"&gt;C. A. Whatley, "Economy: primary sector: 3 mining and quarrying", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 208–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially increased production was made possible by the introduction of cheap labour, provided from the 1830s by large numbers of Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p408"/&gt; There were then changes in mining practices, which included the introduction of [[blasting powder]] in the 1850s and the use of mechanised methods of transferring the coal to the surface,&lt;ref&gt;W. Knox, ''Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800–present'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press Series, 1999), {{ISBN|0748610855}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the introduction of steam power in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p408"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Landed proprietors were replaced by profit-seeking [[leasehold]] partnerships and [[joint-stock]] companies, whose members were often involved in the emerging iron industry.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp211-12"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 industry to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 there were a million coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs;&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, "Scottish 'collier serfs', British coal workers? Aspects of Scottish collier society in the eighteenth century", ''Labour History Review,'' Fall 1995, vol. 60 (2), pp. 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.&lt;ref&gt;A. Campbell, ''The Scottish Miners, 1874–1939'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), {{ISBN|0-7546-0191-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron and steel===
[[File:Monkland Rlies 1848.gif|thumb|right|Map of the Monkland Railways and surrounding lines in 1848]]
The invention of [[James Beaumont Neilson]]'s [[hot blast]] process for smelting iron in 1828 revolutionised the Scottish iron industry, allowing abundant native blackstone iron ore to be smelted with ordinary coal.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; In 1830 Scotland had 27 iron furnaces and by 1840 it was 70, 143 in 1850 and it peaked at 171 in 1860.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"/&gt; Output was over 2,500,000 tons of iron ore in 1857, 6.5 per cent of UK output. Output of [[pig iron]] rose from 797,000 tons in 1854 to peak at 1,206,00 in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"/&gt; In the 1871 census, the workforce in heavy industry overtook textiles in the Strathclyde region and in 1891 it became the majority employer in the country. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, steel production largely replaced iron production.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between [[Monklands (district)|Monkland]] and [[Kirkintilloch]], opened in 1826. By the late 1830s there was a network of railways that included lines between Dundee and Arbroath, and connecting Glasgow, Paisley and Ayr. The line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, largely designed for passenger transport, opened in 1842 and proved highly successful. By the mid-1840s the mania for railways had begun.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p410"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; A good passenger service established by the late 1840s, and a network of freight lines reduced the cost of shipping coal, making products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp17-52/&gt; The [[North British Railway]] was formed in 1844 to link Edinburgh and eastern Scotland with Newcastle and the next year the [[Caledonian Railway]] began connecting Glasgow and the west to Carlisle. The creation of a dense network in the Lowlands with connections to England would take until the 1870s to complete.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7/&gt;

A series of amalgamations meant that five main companies operated 98 per cent of the system by the 1860s. The capital invested in Scottish railways was £26.6 million in 1859 and by 1900 it had reached £166.1 million. The floatation of railway companies was a major factor in the formation of the Scottish stock exchanges and the rise of share holding in Scotland and after the early stages drew in large amounts of English investment.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7&gt;O.

They enabled the [[Aberdeen Angus]] to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp17-52&gt;O. Checkland and S. G.

Vamplew, "Railways and the Transformation of the Scottish Economy", ''Economic History Review'', Feb 1971, vol. 24 (1), pp. 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shipbuilding===
[[File:Govan cranes.JPG|thumb|left|Surviving cranes at the former [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] shipyard in [[Govan]]]]
Shipbuilding on [[Clydeside]] (the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scott family's]] shipyard at Greenock.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shields, ''Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde'' (Glasgow: William MacLellan, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Major firms included [[William Denny and Brothers|Denny]] of Dumbarton, [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] of Greenock, [[Lithgows]] of Port Glasgow, Simon and [[Lobnitz]] of Renfrew, [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] of Linthouse, [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] of Govan, [[A. &amp; J. Inglis|Inglis]] of Pointhouse, [[Barclay Curle]] of Whiteinch, [[Charles Connell and Company|Connell]] and [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] of Scotstoun. Equally important were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery to drive these vessels, the boilers and pumps and steering gear – Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Hastie's and Kincaid's of Greenock, Rowan's of Finnieston, [[Weir Group|Weir's]] of Cathcart, Howden's of Tradeston and [[Doosan Babcock|Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] of Renfrew.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnston, ''Clydeside Capital, 1870–1920: a Social History of Employers'' (Tuckwell Press, 2000), {{ISBN|1862321027}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest customer was Sir William Mackinnon, who ran five shipping companies in the nineteenth century from his base in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;J. Forbes Munro, ''Maritime Enterprise and Empire: Sir William Mackinnon and His Business Network, 1823–1893'' (Boydell Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0851159354}}, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan works, owned by [[Robert Napier and Sons]] were the first to start the production of large passenger iron ships in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"/&gt;

In 1835 the Clyde produced only 5 per cent of the ship tonnage built in Britain. The transition from wooden to iron ships was an uneven one, with wooden ships still cheaper to build until around 1850 and the material continued to be used until the 1860s in ships with composite hulls, like the clipper the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', which was launched from Dumbarton in 1869. Cost also delayed the transition from iron to steel shipbuilding and as late as 1879 only 18,000&amp;nbsp;tons of steel-built shipping was launched on the Clyde, 10 per cent of all tonnage. A similar process occurred in means of propulsion with shifts from sail to steam and back again between the 1840s and the introduction of the more efficient [[steam turbine]] engine that became dominant in the mid-1880s. Tonnage increased by more than a factor of six between 1880 and 1914.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked during the First World War and the term "Clyde-built" became synonymous with industrial quality.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp199-200"&gt;R.

===Engineering architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Forth bridge histo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Forth Bridge]] on completion in 1890]]
The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including [[Thomas Telford]]'s (1757–1834) stone [[Dean Bridge]] (1829–31) and iron [[Craigellachie Bridge]] (1812–14).&lt;ref&gt;C. Harvie, ''Scotland: A Short History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-19-210054-8}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s the possibilities of new [[wrought iron|wrought-]] and [[cast-iron]] construction were explored in the building of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian]] style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–56), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Engine Works built in 1856–58, using massive rubble blocks.&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep254&gt;M.

The most important engineering project was the [[Forth Bridge]], a [[cantilever bridge|cantilever]] railway bridge over the [[Firth of Forth]] in the east of [[Scotland]], 14&amp;nbsp;kilometres (9&amp;nbsp;mi) west of central [[Edinburgh]]. Construction of a [[suspension bridge]] designed by [[Thomas Bouch]] (1822–80), was stopped after the collapse of another of his works, the [[Tay Rail Bridge|Tay Bridge]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;I. B.

Baxter, ''John Fowler, Benjamin Baker, Forth Bridge'' (Axel Menges, 2nd edn., 1997), {{ISBN|3-930698-18-8}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was taken over by [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]] (1817–98) and [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Benjamin Baker]] (1840–1907), who designed a structure that was built by Glasgow-based company [[Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.]] from 1883. It was opened on 4 March 1890, and spans a total length of {{convert|2528.7|m}}. It was the first major structure in Britain to be constructed of steel;&lt;ref name="Blanctal"&gt;A. Blanc, M.

===Population and urbanisation===
{{Main|Demographic history of Scotland}}
[[File:Glasgow map 1878.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Glasgow, the "second city of the Empire", in 1878]]
The census conducted by the Reverend [[Alexander Webster]] in 1755 showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The "Ill Years" of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7486-3887-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;123–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the first [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal census]] in 1801, the population was 1,608,420. It grew steadily in the nineteenth century, to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Cairncross, ''The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University'' (Glasgow: Glasgow University Press, 1953), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While population fell in some rural areas as a result of the agricultural revolution, it rose rapidly in the towns. Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow all grew by a third or more between 1755 and 1775 and the textile town of Paisley more than doubled its population.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ferguson, ''The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest'' (1998) [https://www.questia.com/read/54868029 online edition].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, 17 per cent of people in Scotland lived in towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants. By 1850 it was 32 per cent and by 1900 it was 50 per cent. By 1900 one in three of the entire population were in the four cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"/&gt;

Glasgow emerged as the largest city. Its population in 1780 was 43,000, reaching 147,000 by 1820; by 1901 it had grown to 762,000. This was due to a high birth rate and immigration from the countryside and particularly from Ireland; but from the 1870s there was a fall in the birth rate and lower rates of migration and much of the growth was due to longer life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, pp. 411–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow was now one of the largest cities in the world, and it became known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. MacKenzie, "The second city of the Empire: Glasgow – imperial municipality", in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, ''Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7190-6497-X}}, pp. 215–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravestone of William Beattie and family.JPG|thumb|right|Evidence of high infant mortality on an Edinburgh gravestone]]
[[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbour and established itself as an industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage was based on "the three Js": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the nineteenth century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America. However, the profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade. The reasons were that low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources; thus the Dundee region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lenman and Kathleen Donaldson, "Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850–1921", ''Business History'', Jan 1971, vol. 13(1), pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Lee, ''Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7190-4101-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates were high compared with England and other European nations. Evidence suggests a national death rate of 30 per 1,000 in 1755, 24 in the 1790s and 22 in the early 1860s. Mortality tended to be much higher in urban than rural settlements. The first time these were measured, 1861–82, in the four major cities these were 28.1 per 1,000 and 17.9 in rural areas. Mortality probably peaked in Glasgow in the 1840s, when large inflows of population from the Highlands and Ireland combined population outgrowing sanitary provision and combining with outbreaks of epidemic disease. National rates began to fall in the 1870s, particularly in the cities, as environmental conditions improved.&lt;ref&gt;M. Anderson, "Population patterns: 2 since 1770, in M.

This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.&lt;ref&gt;J. Melling, "Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britain's heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870–1920", ''International Review of Social History'', Dec 1981, vol. 26 (3), pp. 255–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class identity===
[[File:Carron Company trademark.jpg|thumb|left|The Carron Company trademark on the Carron Works, the objective of the 1820 [[Radical War]]]]
One of the consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation was the development of a distinct skilled [[working class]]. W. H. Fraser argues that the emergence of a class identity can be located to the period before the 1820s, when cotton workers in particular were involved in a series of political protests and events. This led to the [[Radical War]] of 1820, in which a declaration of a provisional government by three weavers coincided with a strike by Glasgow cotton workers. The climax of the five-day war was a march from [[Glasgow Green]] to [[Falkirk]] to take control of the [[Carron Company|Carron Iron Works]]. It ended in a cavalry charge by government forces at [[Bonnymuir]]. The result was a discouragement of direct political action by workers, although attempts at political reform continued in movements like [[Chartism]] and the [[Eight-hour day|short hours]] movement in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp390-1"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1830s the political influence of the working classes was expanded through the widening of the franchise, industrial action and the growth and organisation of trade unionism. There were less than 5,000 eligible voters in Scotland before the [[Reform Act 1832|1832 Reform Act]] saw the enlargement of the franchise to include middle class men of business. The [[Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868|1868 Act]] brought in skilled artisans and that of [[Representation of the People Act 1884|1884]] admitted many farm workers, crofters, miners and unskilled men. These changes were supported by trade unions,&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed from the mid-century. Concerted industrial action was undertaken by spinners in the cotton industry in 1836-7 after a collapse of foreign markets led to wage cuts, but was ultimately defeated by the factory owners. The most sustained industrial action was in the mining industry, where the owners controlled employment as well as housing and retail trade through the [[truck system]]. In 1887 colliers in the west of Scotland won a major victory over both wages and rents.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 86–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish trade unionism in the nineteenth century differed from that in the rest of Britain in that unions were often small and highly localised and lacked higher industrial and national organisation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade councils were established in Edinburgh in 1853 and in Glasgow in 1858 in an attempt to organise on a regional basis, but were often ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[new unionism]] of the last two decades of the century saw the dockers and railwaymen organise a network of regional and national support, but this began to wain towards the end of the century and the situation of union parochialism would remain the dominant mode until union amalgamations got under way after 1914.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
[[File:Powerloom weaving in 1835.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of power loom weaving in 1835, showing an idealised view of women working in a clean and spacious environment]]
The industrialisation of Scotland had a major impact of the roles of women. Women and girls formed a much higher proportion of the workforce than elsewhere in Britain and were the majority of workers in some industries. The expansion of flax spinning and the rise of linen industry in the eighteenth century was almost totally dependent on female labour and the situation was similar in the [[sewed muslin]] industry in the West of Scotland towards the end of the century. When flax spinning became mechanised the proportion of men to women was 100:280, the highest proportion of women in the United Kingdom. In Dundee in the 1840s, while male employment increased by a factor of 1.6, female employment went up by 2.5, making it the only large town in Scotland with the majority of its female population in paid employment. In cotton in the nineteenth century women and girls accounted for 61 per cent of the workforce in Scottish mills, compared with 50 per cent in Lancashire. Although most women were employed in the textile industries, they were also a significant proportion of the workforce in other areas, making up 12 per cent of underground workers in mining, compared with 4 per cent in Britain overall.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The expanded opportunities for women, and the extra income they and children brought into the household, probably did the most to help increase living standards for working-class families.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in workforce peaked in the 1830s. As heavy industry began to dominate there were less opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5/&gt; From the mid-nineteenth century there were a series of laws that limited female roles in industry, beginning with the Mines Regulation Act of 1842, which prevented them from working underground. This put 2,500 women out of work in the east of Scotland, causing real hardship as their contribution to the family economy was vital. This was followed by a series of factory acts that placed restrictions on the employment of women. Many of these acts were brought in because of pressure from trade unions who were attempting to secure a living wage for their male members. Women had relatively little involvement in official trade unions for much of the period of industrialisation. However, they were frequently involved in unofficial disputes, the first being recorded in 1768 and of which there are known to have been 300 strikes that involved women between 1850 and 1914. Towards the end of the century there were increasing attempts to unionise women. The Scottish Women's Trade Council (SWTC) was formed in 1887. From this emerged the [[Women's Protective and Provident League]] (WPPL) and the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades (GCWT). In 1893, the National Federal Council of Scotland for Women's Trades (NFCSWT) was established and the Scottish Council for Women's Trades (SCWT) in 1900. By 1895 the NFCSWT alone had an affiliated membership of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Brown, "Women: 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0199234825}}, pp. 647–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration===
[[File:Scottish poster advertising emigration to New Zealand.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"First Scottish Colony for New Zealand" – 1839 poster advertising emigration from Scotland to New Zealand]]
The growth of industry resulted in the arrival of large numbers of workers from Ireland who moved into the factories and mines in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"/&gt; Many were seasonal workers employed as [[navvies]] on the construction of docks, canals and then railways.&lt;ref name=McCarrery2001pp331-3/&gt; An estimated 60–70 per cent of colliers in Lanarkshire were Irish by the 1840s. The arrivals intensified with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Potato famine]] of 1845.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; By the census of 1841, 126,321, or 4.6 per cent of Scotland's population, had been born in Ireland and many more were of Irish descent. Most were concentrated in the west of Scotland, and in Glasgow there were 44,000 people who were born in Ireland, 16 per cent of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;W. Knox, ''Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800–present'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0748610855}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Irish immigrants, about three quarters, were Catholic,&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"/&gt; leading to a major cultural and religious change in Scotland, but a quarter were Protestant, eventually bringing with them institutions like the [[Orange Order]] and intensifying a sectarian divide in the major cities.&lt;ref name=McCarrery2001pp331-3&gt;J. McCaffery, "Immigration, Irish", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 331–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, which with major changes in agriculture, meant that during the period 1841–1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australasia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.&lt;ref name=Houston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii&gt;R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 2001), {{ISBN|0-14-026367-5}}, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who migrated to non-European locations in the century before 1914, 44 per cent went to the US, 28 per cent to Canada, and 25 per cent to Australia and New Zealand. Other important locations included the Caribbean, India and South Africa.&lt;ref name=Harper2001pp232-4&gt;M. D. Harper, "Emigration: 4 post-1750, excluding Highlands", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 232–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were [[Scottish Canadians]] and [[Scottish American]]s as the five million remaining in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Houston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii/&gt; There was little support from the government and in the early stages many migrants agreed to [[indenture]]s, particularly to the [[thirteen colonies]], that paid for their passage and guaranteed accommodation and work for five or seven years. Later immigration was assisted by agents and societies, such as the [[Salvation Army]], [[Barnados]] and the Aberdeen Ladies Union, who often focused on the young or female immigrants.&lt;ref name=Harper2001pp232-4/&gt;{{clear}}

Holdren was involved in the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]] in 1980. He, along with two other scientists helped [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] establish the bet with [[Julian Simon]], in which they bet that the price of five key metals would be higher in 1990. The bet was centered around a disagreement concerning the future scarcity of resources in an increasingly polluted and heavily populated world. Ehrlich and Holdren lost the bet, when the price of metals had decreased by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was chair of the Executive Committee of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] from 1987 until 1997 and delivered the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture on behalf of Pugwash Conferences in December 1995. From 1993 until 2003, he was chair of the [[Committee on International Security and Arms Control]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan National Committee on Energy Policy from 2002 until 2007. Holdren was elected [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) (2006–2007), and served as board Chairman (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He was the founding chair of the advisory board for ''[[Innovations (journal)|Innovations]]'', a quarterly journal about entrepreneurial solutions to global challenges published by MIT Press, and has written and lectured extensively on the topic of [[global warming]].

Holdren served as one of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s science advisors (PCAST) from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Eight years later, President Barack Obama nominated Holdren for the position of science advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in December 2008, and he was [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] on March 19, 2009, by a unanimous vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff and news service reports.

===Writings===
[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] was an early concern and interest. In a 1969 article, Holdren and co-author [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] argued, "if the population control measures are not initiated immediately, and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPanaceas"&gt;Paul R. Erlich and John P. Holdren. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1294858 "Population and Panaceas A Technological Perspective"], ''Bioscience'', Vol 19, pages 1065-1071, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Holdren encouraged a decline in fertility to well below replacement in the United States, because "210 million now is too many and 280 million in 2040 is likely to be much too many."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPredicament"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7jjp9bv0qNYC&amp;dq=no+growth+society&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA31,M1 | journal = Daedalus, the No-Growth Society | year = 1973 | title = Population and the American Predicament: The Case Against Complacency | first = John P. | isbn = 978-0-7130-0136-5 | last = Holdren | pages = 31&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Paul R.

===In popular culture===
Lessig was portrayed by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in "[[The Wake Up Call]]", during season 6 of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/02/09/lessig-portrayed-on.html|title=Lessig portrayed on tonight's West Wing|work=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
[[File:Jonathan Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig (Google DC, March 20 2008).jpg|thumbnail|Lessig speaking with Harvard internet law professor [[Jonathan Zittrain]]]]
Lessig has been politically [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential [[Conservatism|conservative]] judges, Judge [[Richard Posner]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him for his supposed "brilliance" rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the "token liberal" on their staffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-how-political-is-it/|title=Supreme Court Clerk Hiring: Is It Becoming More Political?|work=Above the Law|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|author=Steven Levy|date=October 1, 2002|work=WIRED|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of [[Teenage Republicans]], served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the [[YMCA Youth and Government]] program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymcapa.org/ |title=YMCA Youth and Government Pennsylvania (PA State YMCA) |publisher=Ymcapa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978, and almost pursued a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political career.

What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the [[Eastern Bloc]], where he acquired a lifelong interest in [[Eastern Europe]]an law and politics.

Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the [[John McCain]] campaign for discussing [[fair use]] rights in a letter to [[YouTube]] where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |title=McCain/Palin to YouTube: Get real (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070933/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/mccainpalin_to_youtube_get_rea.html |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and computer activism==
[[File:Lawrence lessig, joi ito.jpg|thumbnail|Lessig with fellow Creative Commons board member [[Joi Ito]]]]

==="Code is law"===
In computer science, "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the [[source code]]). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute [[statutory law]]. In his 1999 book ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'', Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for [[social control]], leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'' in December 2006.

===Remix culture===
Lessig has been a proponent of the [[remix culture]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2004_fall/lessig.htm |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2016-02-27 |title=Remix Is a Cultural Right, Lessig Says |publisher=law.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2008 book [[Remix (book)|''Remix'']]&lt;ref&gt;[http://remix.lessig.org/remix.php Remix] on lessig.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix Remix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060619/https://www.scribd.com/doc/47089238/Remix |date=April 2, 2016 }} on [[scribd.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix Culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, "read/write" culture and the hybrid economy.

According to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of [[Prohibition]], both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely [[Creative Commons license]]s, as a remedy to maintain "rule of law" while combating plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/778455386|title=The social media reader|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|publisher=New York University Press|others=Mandiberg, Michael,|year=2012|isbn=9780814764077|location=New York|pages=155–169|chapter=REMIX: How Creativity is Being Strangled by the Law|oclc=778455386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free culture===
[[File:Aaron Swartz and Lawrence Lessig.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lessig and [[Aaron Swartz]] in 2002 at the launch party for [[Creative Commons]]]]
On March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's board of directors.&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/about/leadership.html |title=Leadership – Free Software Foundation |publisher=Fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of "[[Free-culture movement|free culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/ |title=free_culture |publisher=Randomfoo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supports [[free and open-source software]] and [[open spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/ |title=Spectrum Policy: Property or Commons? |publisher=Cyberlaw.stanford.edu |date=2003-03-02 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his free culture keynote at the [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention]] 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about [[software patent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/|title=free_culture|work=randomfoo.net}} Lessig discusses software patents from time 17:38 to 20:38 of the audio recording&lt;/ref&gt; which he views as a rising threat to [[free software]], [[open source software]] and innovation.

In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the [[Digital Universe]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&amp;EDATE= |title=Digital Universe Adds Leading Internet Expert Lawrence Lessig to Board of Advisors |location=California |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 [[Wikimania]] conference. In December 2006, his lecture '' On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code'' was one of the highlights at [[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons |title=commons |year=2011 |id=google video docid=7661663613180520595 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Lawrence Lessig |title=Colbert Nation |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/215454/january-08-2009/lawrence-lessig |publisher=Comedy Central |date=January 8, 2009 |time=2:16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreword to the [[Freesouls]] book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have&amp;nbsp;... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freesouls.cc/essays/00-foreword-lawrence-lessig.html|title=Freesouls - Foreword by Lawrence Lessig|work=freesouls.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig is also a well-known critic of [[copyright term]] extensions.

===Net neutrality===
[[File:Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg|thumb|Lessig and [[Jimmy Wales]] at the iCommons iSummit07 in [[Dubrovnik]]]]
Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of [[net neutrality]]. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify [[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]]'s four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."&lt;ref&gt;CBC NEWS. Google accused of turning its back on net neutrality. December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative reform===
Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Clark. Software Freedom Fighters. ''The National Journal'' 33(30), July 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," "My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Mills. Domain games: Internet leaves the U.S. nest. ''InfoWorld Daily News''. October 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}{{See also|Eldred v. Ashcroft}}
From 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. Working with the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/10/lessig-3/|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the [[Public domain in the United States|public domain]] and a large number of ''[[Amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]].

In March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig Backs Away From Copy Fights In Courts, Congress.

In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song "[[Lisztomania (song)|Lisztomania]]" by the band [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]], whom Liberation Music represents.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/document/lessig-v-liberation-music-complaint |title=Lessig v.

===''Killswitch''===
{{Main|Killswitch (film)}}
In October 2014, ''Killswitch'', a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as [[Aaron Swartz]], [[Tim Wu]], and [[Edward Snowden]] received its World Premiere at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for [[campaign finance reform]].&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |last1=von Busack |first1=Richard |title=Breaking the Internet: Killswitch Screens at Cinequest |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/cinequest-2015/Killswitch-Edward-Snowden.html |date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |publisher=Metro Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swegles |first1=Fred |title=Battle for Internet Control Fuels O.C. -produced Movie |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/film-657978-internet-big.html/ |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, ''Killswitch'' was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman [[Alan Grayson]]. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [[Net Neutrality]]. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and [[Free Press (organization)]] CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.&lt;ref name="house1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grayson |first1=Alan |title=Grayson Screen Award Winning "Killswitch" Documentary |url=http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |publisher=Congressman Grayson's House of Rep Official Web Page |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227162553/http://grayson.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/330-grayson-screens-award-winning-killswitch-documentary |archivedate=February 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price That You Pay for Rocking The Boat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-alan-grayson/aaron-swartz-killswitch_b_6957576.html |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is "One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.".&lt;ref name="house1"/&gt; [[Richard von Busack]] of the [[Metro Silicon Valley]], writes of ''Killswitch'', "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café".&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Fred Swegles of the [[Orange County Register]], remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by ''Killswitch'', a gripping and fast-paced documentary."&lt;ref name="ocreg"/&gt; Kathy Gill of [[GeekWire]] asserts that "''Killswitch'' is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story.

In February 2008, a [[Facebook]] group formed by law professor [[John Palfrey]] encouraged him to run for Congress from [[California's 12th congressional district]], the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative [[Tom Lantos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://draftlessig.org/ |title=Draft Lessig – Change Congress |publisher=Draftlessig.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |title=On why I am not running (Lessig Blog) |publisher=Lessig.org |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116042748/http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/on_why_i_am_not_running.html |archivedate=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootstrikers===
{{Main|Rootstrikers}}
Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption.&lt;ref name="blog-notrunning" /&gt; To this end, he worked with political consultant [[Joe Trippi]] to launch a web based project called "[[Change Congress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/stanford-law-pr.html |title=Stanford Law Professor Larry Lessig Bets 'Wikipedia' Approach Will Transform Congress &amp;#124; Threat Level from Wired.com |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visualwebcaster.com/event.asp?id=46510 |title=Sunlight Foundation Webcast |publisher=Visualwebcaster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a board member of [[MAPLight.org]], a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.

[[Change Congress]] later became ''Fix Congress First'', and was finally named [[Rootstrikers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php Who We Are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223040848/https://www.rootstrikers.org/whoweare.php |date=December 23, 2011 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111155608/https://www.rootstrikers.org/about.php |date=January 11, 2012 }}, Rootstrikers&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with [[Dylan Ratigan]]'s ''Get Money Out'' campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ Rootstrikers and United Republic], Lawrence Lessig, United Republic, November 16, 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230017/http://unitedrepublic.org/2011/rootstrikers-and-united-republic/ |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us About Us], United Republic {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207223737/http://unitedrepublic.org/about-us |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of [[Demand Progress]], an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.

===Article V convention===

{{main|Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution}}

In 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national Article V convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callaconvention.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206220707/http://www.callaconvention.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 6, 2010 |title=Call a Convention |publisher=Call a Convention |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded ''Fix Congress First!'' with [[Joe Trippi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fixcongressfirst.org/about/ About], Fix Congress First!&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech in 2011, Lessig revealed that he was disappointed with Obama's performance in office, criticizing it as a "betrayal", and he criticized the president for using "the (Hillary) Clinton playbook".&lt;ref name=twsDecM4j8767s&gt;{{cite news |author=Lawrence Lessig |title= Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It |publisher= ''Google, YouTube, Huffington Post''

He said "politics is a rare sport where the amateur is better than the professional."&lt;ref name=twsDecM433s /&gt; He promoted this idea at a September 24–25, 2011, conference he co-chaired with the [[Tea Party Patriots]]' national coordinator,&lt;ref name=conconcon&gt;[http://conconcon.org/ Conference on the Constitutional Convention], Harvard University, September 24–5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Lessig's October 5, 2011, book, ''[[Republic, Lost]]: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It,''&lt;ref name=lessigbook&gt;Lessig, L.

===New Hampshire Rebellion===
The [[Coalition for Open Democracy|New Hampshire Rebellion]] is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014"&gt;Lawrence Lessig, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-were-marching-across-new-hampshire-to-honor-aaron-swartz/282962/ "Why We're Marching Across New Hampshire to Honor Aaron Swartz"], ''The Atlantic'', January 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harper, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/inside-the-beltway-self-awareness-and-the-science-/?page=all "Restless grassroots: New Hampshire 'Rebellion' declares their state is not for sale"] (Inside the Beltway column), ''Washington Times'', December 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;John Koziol, [http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150118/NEWS06/150119165 "NH Rebellion Marching Its Way to Concord for Reform"], ''New Hampshire Union Leader'', January 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist [[Jeff Kurzon]], marched from [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire]] to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling "the systemic corruption in Washington".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Lessig chose this language over the related term "campaign finance reform," commenting that "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The walk was to continue the work of NH Native [[Doris Haddock|Doris "Granny D" Haddock]], and in honor of deceased activist [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="atlantic-2014" /&gt; The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast.&lt;ref name="vasseur"&gt;Flore Vasseur, [https://medium.com/backchannel/larry-lessigs-long-walk-b96d80d34972 "The New Hampshire Rebellion: Larry Lessig's Long Walk"], ''The Medium'', December 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial "New Hampshire primaries", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.&lt;ref name="vasseur" /&gt;

==2016 presidential candidacy==
{{main|Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016}}
Lessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.
On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|nomination]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name="why"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exploring"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/larry-lessig-presidential-campaign-exploration/index.html | title=Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig is exploring a long shot presidential bid | publisher=CNN.com | date=August 11, 2015 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Merica, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by [[Labor Day]] 2015.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Kristin (August 11, 2015) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2015/08/11/harvard-law-professor-exploring-presidential-run/lNQdSFZzDpMzCh0Uinz2aO/story.html "Harvard law professor wants to be president—for one day"], [[Boston.com]]. Retrieved August 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was focused on a single issue: [[The Citizen Equality Act]], a proposal that couples [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] with other laws aimed at curbing [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering]] and ensuring [[Voter suppression in the United States|voting access]].&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt; As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.&lt;ref name="exploring"/&gt;

He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/2016-election/384828/|title=The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race: A Cheat Sheet|last=Graham|first=David|date=2 November 2015|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral College Reform==
In 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the [[Plurality voting system|winner-take-all]] [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote allocation in the various states, called ''Equal Votes''.&lt;ref name="to171005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Douglas|title=Electoral-college reform would have defeated Donald Trump; now some Republicans back effort, seek action before 2020|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2017/10/electoral-college_reform_would.html|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=The Oregonian|date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig is counsel for plaintiffs in ''[[Nemanich v.

In 2002, Lessig received the [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] from the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF).&lt;ref name="Fsf.org"/&gt; He also received the [[Scientific American|Scientific American 50 Award]] for having "argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scientific-american-5-2002-11-11/|title=The Scientific American 50 Award|work=Scientific American|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, Lessig was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/april26/aaas-042606.html |title=Eight scholars elected to academy of arts and sciences |publisher=News-service.stanford.edu |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lessig was born in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], the son of Patricia, who sold real estate, and Lester L.

A '''line shaft''' is a power driven rotating shaft for [[power transmission]] that was used extensively from the [[Industrial Revolution]] until the early 20th century. Prior to the widespread use of [[electric motor]]s small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute [[power (physics)|power]] from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex.  The central power source could be a [[water wheel]], turbine, windmill, animal power or a [[steam engine]].  Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s, [[pulley]]s and gears known as ''millwork''.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Lineshaft drive to lathe, with stepped pulleys for variable speed (Carpentry and Joinery, 1925).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Variable speed belt drive for a [[lathe]]. The fixed pulley on the upper shaft is driven at constant speed by a belt from the power source. The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation – necessary for changing speed. The stepped pulleys (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt.]]

A typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One [[pulley]] on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at flanges. The shafts were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually [[Friction bearing|friction]] type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required in order to ensure that the bearings did not freeze or malfunction.

In the earliest applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating mostly from the 18th century. Flat [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or [[cotton duck]] impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning to keep them in good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.

Pulleys were constructed of wood, iron, steel or a combination thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys could be used to give a variety of speed settings for the machine.

Occasionally gears were used between shafts to change speed rather than belts and different sized pulleys, but this seems to have been relatively uncommon.

==History==
Early versions of line shafts date back into the 18th century, but they were in widespread use in the late 19th century with industrialization.  Line shafts were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and [[Gristmill|grist mills]].

In 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] substituted leather belting for metal gearing to transfer power from the main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Flat belt drive systems became popular in the UK from the 1870s, with the firms of [[J &amp; E Wood]] and [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons]] prominent in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of flat belts was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.&lt;ref name="Hills208"&gt;[[#Hills|Hills]] pp.208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century some factories had a mile or more of line shafts in a single building.

In order to provide power for small shops and light industry, specially constructed "power buildings" were constructed.  Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through line shafts to all the leased rooms.  Power buildings continued to be built in the early days of electrification, still using line shafts but driven by an electric motor.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

As some factories grew too large and complex to be powered by a single steam engine, a system of "sub divided" power came into use.  This was also important when a wide range of speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron.  Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed.  However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones.  The [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts.  Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"&gt;

With factory [[electrification]] in the early 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive line shafting and millwork.  After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn= |pages=14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam turbine powered line shafts were commonly used to drive [[paper machine]]s for speed control reasons until economical methods for precision electric motor speed control became available in the 1980s; since then many have been replaced with sectional electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}} (Article has photo of line shaft and turbine.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Economical variable speed control using electric motors was made possible by [[silicon controlled rectifier]]s (SCRs) to produce direct current and variable frequency drives using [[Power inverter|inverters]] to change DC back to AC at the frequency required for the desired speed.

Most systems were out of service by the mid-20th century and relatively few remain in the 21st century, even fewer in their original location and configuration.

==Disadvantages and alternatives==

===Disadvantages===
Compared to individual electric motor or ''unit'' drive, line shafts have the following disadvantages: &lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;
*Power loss with line shafts varied widely and was typically 25% and often much higher; however, using [[Rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]] and good quality lubrication could minimize losses.  Roller and spherical bearings gained acceptance in the decade before electrification of factories began.
*Continuous noise  
*Maintenance costs were higher.
*The systems were more dangerous.
*Down time due to mechanical problems was higher.
*It was not as easy to change speed.
*Factory layout was designed around access to the line shafts, not in the most efficient manner for the work flow.
*The line shafts and millwork took up a lot of space; Baldwin Locomotive Works estimated 40% more than electric drive.
*The shafts and belting were in the way of lighting, overhead cranes and ventilation ducts.  
*Alignment of the system was critical and problematic for long shafts that were subject to expansion and contraction, settling and vibration.
*The belting shed dust and kept it continuously circulating in the air.
*Oil dripped from the overhead shafting.

Firms switching to electric power showed significantly less employee sick time, and, using the same equipment, showed significant increases in production.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“We can scarcely step into a shop or factory of any description without encountering a mass of belts which seem at first to monopolize every nook in the building and leave little or no room for anything else”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historical alternatives to line shafts===
To overcome the distance and friction limitations of line shafts, wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than line shafts and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers.  They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than line shafts, and had one-tenth the initial cost.

To supply small scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed.  Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe.  The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel production

There were also some central stations providing pneumatic power in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

The '''MTV-1 Micro TV''' was the second model of a [[handheld television|near pocket-sized]] [[television]]. The first was the Panasonic IC model TR-001 introduced in 1970. The MTV-1 was developed by [[Clive Sinclair]] (Sinclair Radionics Ltd). It was shown to the public at [[trade show]]s in [[London]] and [[Chicago]] in January, 1977, and released for sale in 1978. Development spanned 10 years and included a cash infusion of {{GBP|1.6 million|link=yes}} (about {{USD|2.9 million}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) from the UK government in 1976.

The MTV-1 used a [[Germany|German]] [[Telefunken|AEG Telefunken]] {{convert|2|inch|cm|adj=on}} black-and-white, electrostatic [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), the smallest CRT built into a commercially available product, and included a rechargeable 4-[[AA battery|AA]]-cell [[NiCad]] battery pack. It measured {{convert|4|*|6.25|*|1.625|in|mm}} and weighed {{convert|28|oz|g}}. It was able to receive either [[phase alternating line|PAL]] or [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] transmissions on [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]]. A [[Wales|Welsh]] company, Wolsey Electronics, manufactured it for Sinclair. Custom [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]] and Sinclair contributed to its small size and low power consumption.

The original {{USD|395}} (about {{GBP|205}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) price tag proved to be too high to sell many of them, and Sinclair lost over {{GBP|1.8 million}} in 1978, eventually selling its remaining inventory to liquidators at greatly reduced prices.

The MTV-1B, released later in 1978 at the much lower price of {{GBP|99}}, was able to receive only British and South African UHF PAL signals.

The '''Machine Age'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RgQ3pHd1d-UC&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;f=false Mentality and freedom By William Armstrong Fairburn.

An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945. Considered to be at a peak in the time between the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, it forms a late part of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The 1940s saw the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], where [[modern physics]] saw new applications such as the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519100021/http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/history/transistor-1947.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Revolution]] ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of [[high technology]].  The digital era has been called the [[The Second Machine Age|Second Machine Age]], with its increased focus on machines that do mental tasks.

'''Managed Mobility Services''' (MMS) is a term used by analysts and businesses to describe the outsourcing and managing services that many businesses provide.

Mobility Managed Services includes the [[IT]] and [[process management]] service needed for a company to acquire, provision and support [[smartphones]], [[Tablet computer|tablets]] and other field force devices. These services are designed to support devices for corporations are liable and provide a level of control to companies that support them by accessing corporate resources and information.

Managed Mobility Services has existed for some time, but organizations have increasingly shifted responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robbie Westacott |url=http://www.enterprisemobilityexchange.com/eme-byod/articles/the-managed-mobility-services-market-could-reach-11billion-by-2019/ |title=The Managed Mobility Services Market Could Reach $11.05 Billion by 2019 by Robbie Westacott |publisher=Enterprisemobilityexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; for logistics and management as the environments have become more diverse and updates more frequent. [[Android fragmentation]] is sometimes cited as a driver of this growth as is the consumerization of IT, including the adoption of mobile devices by IT departments. This accumulation of influences has been referred to as "The 3 V's": Volume (the number of devices and users involved); Variety (policy changes in order to fit changing standards) and Volatility (high rates of change that could threaten the business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/3Vs |title=What is 3Vs (volume, variety and velocity) ? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Whatis.techtarget.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Included service categories==
[[Gartner]] includes the following categories of services:
* Sourcing and logistics management
* Mobile service management
* Device and system management
* Application and collaboration management
* Security and content management
* Program and financial management

==History==
Gartner first officially produced research on MMS in 2011 with Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services, 22 December 2011, G00225198 Analyst(s): Eric Goodness, Phillip Redman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/document/1882717 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-935.ibm.com/services/uk/en/it-services/pdf/Gartner_Report_-_Critical_Capabilities_for_Managed_Mobility_services.pdf Gartner Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Gartner, [[Forrester Research]], [[GigaOM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/mobility-managed-services-mms |title=Mobility Managed Services (MMS) - Gartner IT Glossary |publisher=Gartner.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2014/07/06/why-managed-mobility-services-are-on-the-rise-with-tech-buyers/ GigaOM Blog on MMS]&lt;/ref&gt; and other analyst organizations have published research on these services, each with slight variations on what services are included.

A '''matrioshka brain'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gwern.net/docs/1999-bradbury-matrioshkabrains.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical [[megastructure]] proposed by Robert Bradbury, based on the [[Dyson sphere]], of immense computational capacity. It is an example of a Class B [[stellar engine]], employing the entire energy output of a star to drive [[computer]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeiveos.com:8080/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/index.html |title=Matrioshka Brain Home Page |first=Robert J. |last=Bradbury |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223093348/http://aeiveos.com:8080/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/index.html |archivedate=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- (Note: If this link is down — as it occasionally is — please do not change the URL. Robert Bradbury has specifically told Wikipedia authors/editors that he does not wish to be associated with "Future Hi", and that it is an unauthorized mirror of his material.) --&gt;
This concept derives its name from the nesting Russian [[Matryoshka doll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The concept was deployed by its inventor, Robert Bradbury, in the anthology ''Year Million: Science at the Far Edge of Knowledge'', and attracted interest from reviewers in the ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Concept==
The concept of a matrioshka brain comes from the idea of using Dyson spheres to power an enormous, star-sized computer. The term "matrioshka brain" originates from [[matryoshka dolls]], which are wooden Russian nesting dolls. Matrioshka brains are composed of several Dyson spheres nested inside one another, the same way that matryoshka dolls are composed of multiple nested doll components. The innermost Dyson sphere of the matrioshka brain would draw energy directly from the star it surrounds and give off large amounts of [[waste heat]] while computing at a high temperature. The next surrounding Dyson sphere would absorb this waste heat and use it for its computational purposes, all while giving off waste heat of its own. This heat would be absorbed by the next sphere, and so on, with each sphere giving off less heat than the one before it. For this reason, matrioshka brains with more nested Dyson spheres would tend to be more efficient, as they would waste less heat energy. The inner shells could run at nearly the same temperature as the star itself, while the outer ones would be close to the temperature of interstellar space. The engineering requirements and resources needed for this would be enormous.

The term "matrioshka brain" was invented by Robert Bradbury as an alternative to the "Jupiter brain"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume5/Brains2.pdf |title=Brains2.dvi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a concept similar to the matrioshka brain, but on a smaller planetary scale and optimized for minimal signal [[propagation delay]]. A matrioshka brain design is concentrated on sheer capacity and the maximum amount of energy extracted from its source [[star]], while a Jupiter brain is optimized for computational speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/JupiterBrains/index.html |title=Jupiter &amp; Matrioshka Brains: History &amp; References |publisher=Robert Bradbury |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907060327/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/JupiterBrains/index.html |archivedate=September 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible uses==

Some possible uses of such an immense computational resource have been proposed. One idea suggested by [[Charles Stross]], in his novel [[Accelerando (book)|''Accelerando'']], would be to use it to run perfect simulations or [[mind transfer|uploads]] of human minds into [[virtual reality]] spaces supported by the Matrioshka brain. Stross even went so far as to suggest that a sufficiently powerful species utilizing enough raw processing power could launch attacks upon, and manipulate, the structure of the universe itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In ''Godplayers'' (2005), [[Damien Broderick]] surmises that a matrioshka brain would allow simulating entire alternate universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Futures studies|futurist]] and [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] author [[Anders Sandberg]] wrote an essay speculating on implications of computing on the massive scale of machines such as the matrioshka brain, published by the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Matrioshka brains and other [[megastructure]]s are a common theme in the [[science fiction|fictional]] [[Orion's Arm]] universe where they are used by [[superintelligence]]s as processing nodes connected via artificial [[wormhole]]s.

A '''message-waiting indicator''' (MWI) in [[telephony]], is a [[Telcordia Technologies]] (formerly [[Bellcore]]) term for an [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]-based [[telephone]] calling feature that illuminates an [[LED]] on selected [[telephones]] to notify a telephone user of waiting [[voicemail]] messages on most North American public telephone networks and [[Private branch exchange|PBXs]].

As described in Telcordia Generic Requirements document [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-283&amp; GR-283-CORE], a Message_Waiting_Indicator (MWI) is a mechanism that informs the subscriber about the status of recorded messages.{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} The subscriber may subscribe to a notification feature that makes use of the status of this MWI.

This feature is also frequently called (and abbreviated) as '''visual message waiting indicator''' (VMWI).  A VMWI, as defined in [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1401&amp; Telcordia GR-1401-CORE], is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a visual indicator on [[customer-premises equipment]] (CPE) to notify the customer that new messages are waiting.  VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered [[dial tone]], in that it activates a visual indicator on the CPE.  The visual indicator may be as simple as lighting or flashing a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD).

This technology was invented by Jerome (Jerry) Schull and Wayne Howe at BellSouth's Advanced Technology R&amp;D group in 1992 and was issued as US Patents [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=12&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=howe-wayne$.INNM.&amp;OS=in/howe-wayne$&amp;RS=IN/howe-wayne$ #5,363,431] and  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=10&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=howe-wayne$.INNM.&amp;OS=in/howe-wayne$&amp;RS=IN/howe-wayne$ #5,521,964].  It was introduced in 1995, with the introduction of [[CLASS-based calling]] features and [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]].  It was at one time only compatible with [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]]-compliant telephones but is now compatible with any customer premises equipment ([[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]]) that simply responds visually to visual [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]].

==Use of similar indicator on standalone Caller ID set-top boxes==
This service is often erroneously associated with the abilities of most [[Caller ID]] standalone set-top boxes.  Caller ID boxes manufactured after 1998 feature an [[LED]] that blinks green to notify that new calls have been recorded and red to indicate that a subscriber has new voicemail messages waiting.  Some units also display the text "MESSAGE WAITING" (similar to [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]]-compliant telephones).  These units do not use visual FSK to activate their red LEDs, but instead, they briefly "[[off hook|pick-up]]" the line at certain intervals (normally, within two minutes of a new call) to check for a "stuttered" [[dial tone]].  The presence of a stutter dial tone activates a red LED; while absence deactivates it.

==Mobile telephony==
For [[mobile phone]]s, the message-waiting indicator is sent via a [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) message — the same system used for [[texting]]. (SMS was actually invented for utilitarian uses like this, not for user conversation.)  It not only indicates that a message is waiting, but also how many unheard messages there are on the voicemail [[server (computing)|server]] for that [[MSISDN|telephone number]].  In the event that a phone is deactivated, out of range, or otherwise removed from the network, there is often no way to clear this indicator until another message is recorded to the system, causing the MWI message to be sent again once the phone reconnects.  The [[customer service]] [[call center]] for the [[mobile network operator]] may also be able to provide simple [[technical support]] to reset this by resending the MWI message manually.

In the past [[computers]] needed to be disconnected from their internal network if they needed to be taken or moved anywhere. ''Mobile architecture'' allows maintaining this connection whilst during transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bukhres97proposed.html  A Proposed Mobile Architecture for Distributed Database Environment] (1997)  O. Bukhres, S. Morton, P. Zhang, E. Vanderdijs, C. Crawley&lt;/ref&gt; Each day the number of mobile devices is increasing, mobile architecture is the pieces of technology needed to create a rich, connected user experience. 
Currently there is a lack of uniform interoperability plans and implementation. There is a lack of common industry view on architectural framework. This increases costs and slows down 3rd party mobile development. An open approach is required across all industries to achieve same end results and services.

==Important components of a mobile architecture==
*'''Scalability''' – A Mobile Architecture must be able to be utilized with all recovery requirements on both large and small scale.
*'''Secure''' – Encryption is important, transmission protocols must support encryption ([[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]) via secure transit such as [[HTTPS]]
*'''Reliable''' – Reliability is always important in all technologies and mobile architecture is no different.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The basic and detail architecture of the Mobile device consists of Hardware and Software architecture. The main hardware components
of the mobile phone is the application processor that controls all other components of the device such as display, keypad, power, audio , video etc. The radio signals are handled by base band
processor which in turn communicates with other processors to use their functionality. Power and audio processor controls the functioning of speaker and microphone with the help of application
processor. Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) contains the details about the subscriber.

==Best practices==
* Data should be populated for database views
* Use version numbers to track updates during synchronization
* Maintain only necessary user details in middle ware
* The application should recognize when CPU battery is low and adjust background running to low to extend battery power
* UI on multiple screens should have common elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb985493  Best Practices: Extending Enterprise Applications to Mobile Devices] (1997)  The Architecture Journal : Journal 14 Kulathumani Hariharan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
A consortium of companies are pushing for products and services to be based on open, global standards, protocols and interfaces and are not locked to proprietary technologies. The applications layer to be bearer agnostic (examples: GSM, GPRS, EDGE, CDMA, UMTS). The architecture framework and service enablers will be independent of operating systems. There will be support for inseparability of applications and platforms, seamless geographic and inter-generational roaming.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Nanosocialism''' refers generally to a set of [[economics|economic theories]] of [[social organization]] advocating [[State (polity)|state]] or [[collective ownership]] and administration of the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of [[nanotechnology]].

== Politics ==

{{further|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Nanosocialism is a stance that favors [[participatory politics]] to guide [[state intervention]] in the effort to manage the transition to a [[society]] revolutionized by [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Berube, David|    title = Nanosocialism|    year = 1996 |   url = http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm| accessdate=2007-01-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061225060622/http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[James Hughes (sociologist)|Hughes, James]]|    title = Politics of Transhumanism|    year = 2001 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nanosocialism" is a term coined by [[David M. Berube]], the associate director of Nanoscience and Technology Studies at the USC NanoCenter, who argues that nanotechnological projections need to be tempered by [[technorealism]] about the [[implications of nanotechnology]] in a [[technocapitalist]] society, but that its [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]] also offer enormous opportunities for [[abundance (economics)|economic abundance]] and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'', nanosocialism is described as a descendant of [[infosocialism]], in which [[intellectual property]] is [[nationalization|nationalized]] and freely distributed by the state. It is adopted by some developing nations to counter the hold corporations from wealthier nations have on [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s. This fictional version of nanosocialism was coined by [[David L. Pulver]], the game's creator, who was unaware that the term had already been used by Berube.

'''Neophile''' or '''Neophiliac''', a term popularised by cult writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]],  is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for [[novelty]]. The term was used earlier by [[Christopher Booker]] in his book [[The Neophiliacs]] (1969), and by [[J. D. Salinger]] in his short story [[Hapworth 16, 1924]] (1965).

==Characteristics==
Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics:

* The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.
* A distaste or downright loathing of [[tradition]], repetition, and routine.
* A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.
* A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.
* A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.
* A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.

A neophile is distinct from a [[revolutionary]] in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term [[visionary]], but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.

The opposite of a neophile is a [[neophobia|neophobe]]; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as "[[witch]]," "[[satanist]]," "[[heresy|heretic]]," etc. He also speculates in his [[Prometheus Rising]] series of books that the [[industrial revolution]] and related [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way.

==Types==
Open-source advocate and programmer [[Eric S. Raymond]] observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily [[computer science]] and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls "leading edge subcultures" such as science fiction fandom, [[neo-paganism]], [[transhumanism]], etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the [[occult]]. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read.

There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary [[philosopher]] and the [[technophile]]), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the [[extreme sports]] enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual.

The word "neophilia" has particular significance in Internet and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' gave the following definition to neophilia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most hackers, [[Science fiction|SF]] fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology '[[Whole Earth Review|Whole Earth]]' wing of the [[ecology movement]], [[space activist]]s, many members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and the [[Discordianism|Discordian]]/[[neo-pagan]] underground (see [[geek]]). All these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, [[music]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research has uncovered a possible link between certain predisposition to some kind of neophilia and increased levels of the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] A.&lt;ref name="pmid16538181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiraishi H, Suzuki A, Fukasawa T, Aoshima T, Ujiie Y, Ishii G, Otani K | title = Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter polymorphism affects novelty seeking and reward dependence in healthy study participants | journal = Psychiatr.

'''Online shaming''' is a form of [[Internet vigilantism]] in which targets are [[Public humiliation|publicly humiliated]] using technology like [[Social media|social]] and [[new media]]. Proponents of shaming see it as a form of [[online participation]] that allows [[hacktivism|hacktivists]] and [[cyber-dissident]]s to right injustices. Critics see it as a tool that encourages [[mob mentality|online mobs]] to destroy the reputation and careers of people or organizations who made perceived slights.

Online shaming frequently involves the publication of private information on the Internet (called [[doxing]]), which can frequently lead to hate messages and [[death threat]]s being used to intimidate that person. The ethics of public humiliation has been a source of debate over [[Internet privacy|privacy]] and [[Media ethics|ethics]].
{{toclimit|4}}

==Public shaming==
[[File:Pillory 9105377.jpg|thumb|Jon Ronson has compared modern online shaming to medieval [[Pillory|pillories]].]]
The [[social networking]] tools of the Internet have been used as a tool to easily and widely publicize instances of perceived anti-social behavior.

David Furlow, chairman of the Media, Privacy and Defamation Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], has identified the potential privacy concerns raised by websites facilitating the distribution of information that is not part of the [[public record]] (documents filed with a government agency), and has said that such websites "just [give] a forum to people whose statements may not reflect truth."&lt;ref name="snitching redeye"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Swartz, RedEye |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-31/news/0705310470_1_unique-visitors-web-drivers |title=The wide world of cyber snitching |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some controversial incidents of public shaming, the popular link-sharing and discussion website [[Reddit]] introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public [[personally-identifying information]] via the site (colloquially known on Reddit and elsewhere as "[[doxing]]"{{clarify|date=December 2015}}). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

In 2015, online shaming was the subject of the book ''[[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]]'' by [[Jon Ronson]].&lt;ref name="onthemedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/story/jon-ronson-and-public-shaming/|title=Jon Ronson And Public Shaming|work=onthemedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronson documented how people had become [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] due to humiliation online for misinterpreted jokes, and says people should think twice before gleefully condemning someone for doing almost nothing wrong.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt;

===Doxing===
{{main article|Doxing|cyber-stalking}}
Doxing involves researching and broadcasting [[personally identifiable information]] about an individual, often with the intention of harming that person.&lt;ref name=economistexplains&gt;{{cite news|last=S-W|first=C.|title=What doxxing is, and why it matters|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-9|publisher=The Economist, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodrich"&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Doxing?|publisher=TechNewsDaily.com|author=Ryan Goodrich|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/17590-what-is-doxing.html|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragan"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI’s warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zurcher|first=Anthony|title=Duke freshman reveals porn identity|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-echochambers-26477417|publisher=BBC, United Kingdom|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can often lead to [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[harassment]] and other forms of abuse. On February 1, 2017, Reddit, a social news website, has banned two [[alt-right]] communities, r/altright and r/alternativeright for doxing and violating Reddit community guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/reddit-bans-raltright-over-doxing/|title=Reddit bans r/altright over doxing|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=February 1, 2017|website=TechCrunch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/68000-reddit-bans-alt-right-subreddits-doxing.html|title=Reddit bans 'alt-right' subreddits for doxing|last=Schiesser|first=Tim|date=February 1, 2017|website=TechSpot|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14478948/reddit-alt-right-ban-altright-alternative-right-subreddits-doxing|title=Reddit bans two prominent alt-right subreddits|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=February 1, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge porn===
Nonconsensual pornography is a form of sexually explicit recording publicized on the Internet in order to humiliate a person, frequently distributed by [[hacker (term)|computer hackers]] or ex-partners (called [[revenge porn]]). Images and video of sexual acts are often combined with doxing of a person's private details, such as their home addresses and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bazelon,[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html Why Do We Tolerate Revenge Porn?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (Sept. 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Eric Larson, [http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/revenge-porn/ "It's Still Easy to Get Away With Revenge Porn"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[wikt:victim|Victims']] lives can be ruined as a result, the victims exposed to [[cyber-stalking]] and physical attack as well as facing difficulties in their workplace should their images become known as a result of routine checks by employers. Some have lost their jobs, while others have been unable to find work at all.&lt;ref name = Citron&gt;Danielle K. Citron, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/opinion/citron-revenge-porn/index.html "‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime"], ''CNN Opinion'' (Aug. 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reviews===
Products frequently attract negative reviews on [[Goodreads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/18/am-i-being-catfished-an-author-confronts-her-number-one-online-critic|title='Am I being catfished?'

In July 2015, a group hacked the user data of [[Ashley Madison]], a commercial dating website marketed as helping people have extramarital affairs. In August 2015, over 30 million user account details, including names and email addresses were released publicly.

A variety of security researchers and [[Internet privacy]] activists debated the ethics of the release.&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2015/08/notes-on-the-ashley-madison-hack|title=Early Notes on the Ashley Madison Hack|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/07/20/ashley-madison-ethics-journalism-hacked-documents/|title=In the wake of Ashley Madison, towards a journalism ethics of using hacked documents|work=Online Journalism Blog|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/19/ashley-madison-media/|title=Ashley Madison hack: The ethics of naming users |work=Fortune|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.includesecurity.com/2015/08/forensic-analysis-of-the-AshleyMadison-Hack.html|title=Include Security Blog – As the ROT13 turns….: A light-weight forensic analysis of the AshleyMadison Hack|author=Include Security|work=includesecurity.com|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Justine Sacco, a woman with 170 Twitter followers, tweeted acerbic jokes during a plane trip from New York to Cape Town, such as "Weird German dude get some deodorant"&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt; and, in [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]; "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just Kidding. I'm white!" Sacco, a South African herself,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; intended the tweet to mock American ignorance of South Africa, and in a later interview expressed that her intention was to "mimic—and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say."&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ronson, Jon|authorlink1=Jon Ronson|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choire|first1=Sicha|title=Jon Ronson's 'So You've Been Publicly Shamed'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/jon-ronsons-so-youve-been-publicly-shamed.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco slept during her 11-hour plane trip, and woke up to find out that she had lost her job and was the number one Twitter topic worldwide, with celebrities and [[new media]] bloggers all over the globe denouncing her and encouraging all their followers to do the same. Sacco's employer, New York internet firm [[IAC (company)|IAC]], declared that she had lost her job as Director of Corporate Communications.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015" /&gt; People began tweeting "Has Justine landed yet?", expressing [[schadenfreude]] at the loss of her career.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Sam Biddle]], the [[Gawker Media]] blogger who promoted the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag, later apologised for his role, admitting that he did so for Internet traffic to his blog,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; and noting that "it's easy and thrilling to hate a stranger online.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/journalist-apologizes-for--hasjustinelandedyet-twitter-uproar-after-pr-exec-s-aids-joke-164616178.html|title=Journalist apologizes for #HasJustineLandedYet Twitter uproar after PR exec's AIDS joke|date=20 December 2014|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/12/the-internet-rewards-the-meanest-people-most/|title=The Internet Rewards the Meanest People Most|author=Chris Thilk|work=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronson, the public does not understand that a vigilante campaign of public shaming, undertaken with the ostensible intention of defending the [[Underdog (term)|underdog]], may create a mob mentality capable of destroying the lives and careers of the public figures singled out for shaming.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Ronson argued that in the early days of Twitter, people used the platform to share intimate details of their lives, and not as a vehicle of [[Shame society|shaming]]. [[Brooke Gladstone]] argued that the Sacco affair may deter people from expressing themselves online due to a fear of being misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Kelly McBride argues that journalists play a key role in expanding the shame and humiliation of targets of the campaigns by relaying claims to a larger audience, while justifying their actions as simply documenting an event in an impartial manner.&lt;ref name=poyntersacco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/326097/journalism-and-public-shaming-some-guidelines/|title=Journalism and public shaming: Some guidelines|work=poynter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes: "Because of the mob mentality that accompanies public shaming events, often there is very little information about the target, sometimes only a single tweet. Yet there is a presumption of guilt and swift move toward justice, with no process for ascertaining facts." McBride further notes "If newspapers ran front-page photos of adulterers in the Middle East being stripped naked and whipped in order to further their shame, we would criticize them as part of a backward system of justice." Ben Adler compared the Sacco incident to a number of Twitter hoaxes, and argued that the media needs to be more careful to fact-check articles and evaluate context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/news_literacy/news_literacy_twitter.php|title=Trusting Twitter|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adria Richards incident====
In March 2013, at a [[Python Conference|PyCon]] technology conference, a female participant named Adria Richards took offense at a private discussion between two male attendees seated nearby using the words "[[dongle]]" and "[[Fork (software development)|forking]]" in reference to the male presenter, which she perceived as a sexual joke. Richards photographed the attendees with their faces visible, then published the photograph on Twitter including a shaming statement in her tweet. The following day, the employer of one of the photographed individuals, a software developer, terminated his employment because of the joke.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Guardian|title=The Internet Shaming of Lindsey Stone|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment to Hacker News article 'Inappropriate comments at pycon 2013 called out'|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Techie Adria Richards fired after tweeting about men's comments|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57575905/techie-adria-richards-fired-after-tweeting-about-mens-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Asking What Adria Richards Could Have Done Differently Is The Wrong Question|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/03/22/why-asking-what-adria-richards-could-have-done-differently-is-the-wrong-question/ | first=Deanna|last=Zandt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22863310/sendgrid-employees-tweet-sets-off-firestorm|title=SendGrid employee's tweet sets off firestorm|publisher=The Denver Post|first=Andy|last=Vuong|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Richards' public shaming of the developers, Internet users who were uninvolved launched a [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS Attack]] on her employer, [[SendGrid]], and according to an article by Jon Ronson in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' "told the employer the attacks would stop if Richards was fired".&lt;ref name="nytjonronson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|first=Jon|last=Ronson|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SendGrid subsequently terminated her employment later the same day citing Richards' dividing the very community she was hired to unite, and the male anatomy joke she had posted a few days earlier on the employer website. Following the incident, PyCon updated its attendee rules stating, "Public shaming can be counter-productive to building a strong community. PyCon does not condone nor participate in such actions out of respect."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytjonronson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How "dongle" jokes got two people fired—and led to DDoS attacks|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview, Richards—still unemployed—speculated whether the developer was responsible for instigating the Internet backlash against her.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt; The developer, who was offered a new job "right away", said he had not engaged with those who sent him messages of support, and had posted a short statement on [[Hacker News]] the same night after he was fired saying in part that Richards had "every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position".&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews" /&gt;

In February 2009, an incident occurred involving the posting on [[YouTube]] of a video clip in which a domestic [[cat]], named Dusty, was beaten and tortured by a 14-year-old&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. cat abuser punished by the internet|work=[[Russia Today TV|Russia Today]]|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-16/U.S._cat_abuser_punished_by_the_internet.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221041335/http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-16/U.S._cat_abuser_punished_by_the_internet.html|archivedate=2009-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; boy calling himself "Timmy".&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sicko beats cat in YouTube clip|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|last=Watson|first=Leon|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2241852.ece|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After about 30,000 viewings, this clip and the account were removed by YouTube as a violation of their [[terms of service]].&lt;ref name="russia"/&gt; Members of the [[4chan]] [[imageboard]] investigated the incident, and by extrapolating from the poster's YouTube user name and the background in the video, they identified the abuser.&lt;ref name="irish"&gt;{{cite news|title=Online users stick claws into torturer|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=O'Brien|first=Danny|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0220/1224241467858.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these complaints, the Comanche County Sheriff's Department investigated the incident,&lt;ref name="kswo1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comanche County teen films himself abusing cat, airs on YouTube|date=2009-02-15|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9849597}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two suspects were arrested.&lt;ref name="kswo2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Update: Lawton teen films himself abusing cat, posts on YouTube|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9850040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty survived the abuse, and was placed in the care of a local [[veterinarian]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube 'cat torturer' traced by web detectives|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|last=Moore|first=Matthew|date=2009-02-17|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4678878/YouTube-cat-torturer-traced-by-web-detectives.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the assailant and the cameraman were charged with [[animal cruelty]]; as both were juveniles, possible punishments included "psychological counseling, court monitoring until they turn 18, community service to provide restitution for treatment of animals, and/or placement in court custody."&lt;ref name="kswo4"&gt;{{cite news|title=Update: Teens face two charges of animal cruelty after posting cat abuse on YouTube|date=2009-02-17|accessdate=2009-02-25|url=http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9859463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Kitten Killer of Hangzhou====

In 2006, Wang-Jue ({{zh|s=王珏|t=王玨|p=''Wáng-Jué'' |links=no}}), a Chinese nurse appearing in an Internet [[Crush film|crush video]] stomping a helpless kitten with her stilettos, gave herself up to authorities after bloggers and some print media started a campaign to trace back the recording. In the beginning, she was labeled as the kitten killer of [[Hangzhou]], because it was believed she was from there; but some [[internaut]]s recognized an island in northern [[Heilongjiang]] province. Upon discovery of her identity, Wang Jue received death threats from many angry animal lovers.

Wang posted an apology on the [[Luobei]] city government official website. She said she was recently divorced and did not know what to do with her life. She and the cameraman, a provincial TV employee, lost their jobs when internauts discovered their identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/16/content_540375.htm|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|title=High-heeled kitten killer apologizes|date=2006-03-16|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_the-meow-murderess-brought-to-heel_1018584|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|title=The meow murderess brought to heel|date=2006-03-18|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cat dumped in wheelie bin====

In August 2010, a passer-by in [[Coventry]], [[England]], later identified as Mary Bale by [[4chan]]'s members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5622237/how-4chan-brought-the-evil-british-cat-lady-to-justice?skyline=true&amp;s=i|newspaper=[[Gawker]]|title=How 4chan Brought the Evil British Cat Bin Woman to Justice|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831034743/http://valleywag.gawker.com/5622237/how-4chan-brought-the-evil-british-cat-lady-to-justice?skyline=true&amp;s=i|archivedate=2010-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught on a private security camera stroking a cat, named Lola, then looking around and dumping her in a [[Wheelie bins|wheelie bin]], where she was found by her owners 15 hours later. The owners posted the video on the Internet in a bid to identify the woman, who was later interviewed by the [[RSPCA]] about her conduct. Outrage was sparked among animal lovers, and a Facebook group called "Death to Mary Bale" was created, and later removed. Police said they were speaking to the 45-year-old about her personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11087061|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|title=Woman who dumped cat in wheelie bin 'profoundly sorry'|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bale was convicted under the Animal Welfare Act of 2006 with causing unnecessary suffering to a cat. An additional charge of failing to provide the cat with a suitable environment was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11573883|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|title=Cat bin dumping woman fined for cruelty offence|date=2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was fined £250 and ordered to pay costs, totaling £1,436.04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/19/cat-bin-woman-mary-bale|title=Cat bin woman Mary Bale fined £250|first=Patrick|last=Barkham|date=19 October 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 December 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rabbit gate====

In 2010, a case was publicized involving a young female from [[Sichuan]], using the alias Huang siu siu (黄小小), torturing and crushing rabbits.  The group that financially sponsored the making of these videos, later revealed to be called "Crushfetish", paid young girls to crush fish, insects, rabbits and other small animals.  The girl was paid 100 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for each attempt, and she had been participating since 2007.  Police said the group makes videos to sell overseas, and the company has allegedly made 279 animal abuse videos with a subscription fee.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20101203-250663.html Rabbit-crushing woman confesses]."

====China's Watch Brother Incident====

On August 26, 2012, [[Yang Dacai]], chief of the Shanxi provincial work safety administration, was caught grinning widely amid the wreckage of a long-distance bus that killed 36 passengers when it collided with a tanker loaded with highly flammable methanol on a Chinese highway in [[Shanxi]] Province. Pictures of the accident began to circulate on [[Sina Weibo]], the most popular micro-blogging site in China which led to a meme dubbing him as the "Smiling Brother". Searches on the [[human flesh search engine]] followed leading to pictures surfacing on Weibo, showing Yang wearing luxury watches such as a $10,000 Rolex initiating another meme calling him "Watch Brother". On September 21, Yang was relieved of his position and accused of serious discipline violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Down ‘Watch Brother’: China’s Online Corruption-Busters Tread a Fine Line|publisher=Time World|url=http://world.time.com/2012/10/10/bringing-down-watch-brother-chinas-online-corruption-busters-tread-a-fine-line/#ixzz2QUeH7SHl | date=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of taking bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China 'smiling official' Yang Dacai jailed for 14 years|publisher=BBC|url=

====Dog Poop Girl====

In 2005 in South Korea, [[blog]]gers targeted a woman who refused to clean up when her dog [[defecation|defecated]] on the floor of a [[Seoul Subway Line 2|Seoul subway]] car, labeling her "Dog Poop Girl" (rough translation of {{lang-ko|"개똥녀"}} into English). Another commuter had taken a photograph of the woman and her dog, and posted it on a popular South Korean website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japundit.com/archives/2005/06/30/808/ |title=Puppy poo girl |publisher=Japundit.com |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915111805/http://japundit.com/archives/2005/06/30/808/ |archivedate=2008-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, she had been identified by Internet vigilantes, and much of her [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] was leaked onto the Internet in an attempt to punish her for the offense. The story received mainstream attention when it was widely reported in South Korean media. The public humiliation led the woman to drop out of her [[university]], according to reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070601953.html |title=Subway Fracas Escalates Into Test Of the Internet's Power to Shame |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2009-03-03 | first=Jonathan | last=Krim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction by the South Korean public to the incident prompted several newspapers in South Korea to run editorials voicing concern over Internet vigilantism. One paper quoted [[Daniel J. Solove|Daniel Solove]] as saying that the woman was the victim of a "cyber-posse, tracking down norm violators and branding them with digital [[The Scarlet Letter|Scarlet Letters]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2005/07/08/2005070861017.html |title="Trial by Internet" Casts Spotlight on Korean Cyber Mobs |publisher=Digital Chosunilbo : Daily News in English About Korea |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another called it an "Internet witch-hunt," and went on to say that "the Internet is turning the whole society into a [[kangaroo court]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=25576 |title= Internet Witch-hunts |publisher=AsiaMedia|date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=2009-03-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026005818/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=25576|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory====

In 2008, a 5-year-old girl asked to use the bathroom at the [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] at Bella Terra/Huntington Beach, but was disallowed from using it because the Factory's restrooms were for employees only.  The girl's mother describes the incident this way: "I explained she had diarrhea and couldn't hold it and told [the store owners] she was about to go on the floor. They refused again and never offered me any alternatives. I begged them to have a heart and that she was 5 but by that time she had lost it all over herself and me."&lt;ref name="Chasik"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://consumerist.com/2008/06/rocky-mountain-chocolate-factory-refuses-bathroom-access-to-5-year-old-who-then-has-diarrhea-in-fron.html|title=Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Refuses Bathroom Access to 5-Year-Old, Who Then Has Diarrhea In Front Of Them|last=Chasik|first=Alex|date=2008-06-24|publisher= consumerist.com|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story then spread to sites like digg.com where contact information for the owner of the store was released in message boards.

In 2008, a girl called Zhang Ya ({{lang-zh|s=张雅|t=張雅|p=Zhāng Yǎ|links=no}}) from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Northeast China]], posted a 4-minute video of herself complaining about the amount of attention the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] victims were receiving on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/23/content_8237906.htm|title=Where angles and devils meet – China's Internet in quake aftermath|last=Lin|first=Qiu|date=2008-05-23|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intense response from Internet vigilantes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suopei8.com/news/2008/0522/article_1477.html 关于辽宁女张雅辱骂灾区人民的违法行为讨论] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181624/http://www.suopei8.com/news/2008/0522/article_1477.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the girl's personal details&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cache.tianya.cn/publicforum/content/free/1/1261153.shtml|title=有个姑娘名叫张雅|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (even including her blood type) being made available online, as well as dozens of abusive video responses on Chinese websites and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qihoo.com/wenda.php?kw=%D5%C5%D1%C5&amp;do=search&amp;noq=q |script-title=zh:我帮你找到了张雅的资料，看看满意吗？ |publisher=Qihoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl was taken into police custody for three days as protection from vigilante death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kugz.net/thread-42994-1-1.html |script-title=zh:张雅 辽宁女 沈阳公安局证实:张雅被抓 |publisher=Kugz.net |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2012-03-12|language=zh|trans-title=Liaoning Public Security Bureau confirmed: Zhang Ya caught}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stephen Fowler and ''Wife Swap''====

Stephen Fowler, a [[UK|British]] [[expatriate]] and [[venture capitalist]] [[businessman]], gained notoriety after his performance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)|Wife Swap]]'' (originally aired Friday January 30, 2009) when his wife exchanged positions in his family with a woman from [[Missouri]] for a two-week period. In response to her rule changes (standard procedure for the second week in the show) he insulted his guest and, in doing so, groups including the lower classes, soldiers, and the overweight. Several websites were made in protest against his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/husbands-behaving-badly--120 |title=Husbands Behaving Badly - Yahoo! TV Blog |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show, and after watching the ''Wife Swap'' video, his wife, a professional [[life coach]], reported that she had encouraged him to attend professional behaviour counselling.  Businesses with only tangential connection to Fowler publicly disclaimed any association with him due to the negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/399231_theinsider09.html |title=The Insider: TV viewers stuff wrong inbox over 'Wife Swap' |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned positions on the boards of two environmental charities to avoid attracting negative press.

====Cyclist abuser incident====

In 2008, video of Patrick Pogan,  a rookie police officer, body-slamming Christopher Long, a cyclist, surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzRczBk06M |title=Officer Patrick Pogan |publisher=youtube.com |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The altercation happened when members of [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] conducted a bicycling advocacy event at [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7DC173CF93AA15754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;fta=y |title=Officer Investigated in Toppling of Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=James | last=Barron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officer claimed the cyclist had veered into him, and so the biker was charged with assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

The charges against the cyclist were later dropped and Pogan was convicted of lying about the confrontation with the cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/nyregion/30pogan.html |title=Ex-Officer Convicted of Lying About Confrontation With Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=John | last=Eligon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vigilante group targets mother====

In 2009, a Facebook group was started, accusing a single mother for the death of a 13-month-old child in her foster care. It was the mother's then common-law husband who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the mother was not formally accused of any wrongdoing. However, the members of the group, such as the boy's biological mother, accuse her of knowing what was going on and doing nothing to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/03/13/8733411-sun.html |title=Internet vigilante group torments mother |publisher=cnews.canoe.ca |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=Andrew | last=Hanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Cooks Source'' incident====

{{Main article|Cooks Source infringement controversy}}
The food magazine ''Cooks Source'' printed an article by Monica Gaudio without her permission in their October 2010 issue. Learning of the copyright violation, Gaudio emailed Judith Griggs, managing editor of ''Cooks Source Magazine'', requesting that the magazine both apologize and also donate $130 to the Columbia School of Journalism as payment for using her work. Instead she received a very unapologetic letter stating that she (Griggs) herself should be thanked for making the piece better and that Gaudio should be glad that she didn't give someone else credit for writing the article. During the ensuing public outcry, online vigilantes took it upon themselves to avenge Gaudio. The ''Cooks Source'' Facebook page was flooded with thousands of contemptuous comments, forcing the magazine's staff to create new pages in an attempt to escape the protest and accuse 'hackers' of taking control of the original page. The magazine's website was stripped of all content by the staff and shut down a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Rene|title=Cooks Source magazine vs. the Web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dailydish/2010/11/cooks-source-magazine-vs-the-web.html|accessdate=19 November 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a junior barrister Charlotte Proudman working in the UK [[Twitter#Tweets|tweeted]] a screenshot of her [[LinkedIn]] exchange with Alexander Carter-Silk, a senior City solicitor, rebuking him for complimenting her on her profile photograph. The social media backlash included Proudman finding herself condemned as a "[[feminazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Caroline | title = Stories of 2015: the barrister branded a 'feminazi' in LinkedIn sexism row | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/charlotte-proudman-feminazi-barrister-linkedin-sexism-row | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 29 December 2015 | access-date = 16 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''real-time computing''' ('''RTC'''), or '''reactive computing''' describes [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]] systems subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from [[Event (synchronization primitive)|event]] to [[Event (computing)|system response]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/ctime std::ctime]&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as "deadlines".&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari-pg164"&gt;Ben-Ari, M., "Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming", Prentice Hall, 1990. {{ISBN|0-13-711821-X}}. Ch16, Page 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The correctness of these types of systems depends on their temporal aspects as well as their functional aspects. Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. A system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually ''guarantee'' a response within any timeframe, although ''typical'' or ''expected'' response times may be given.

A real-time system has been described as one which "controls an environment by receiving data, processing them, and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=James|title=Programming Real-time Computer Systems|date=1965|publisher=Prentice-Hall  Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=0-13-730507-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Programming_real_time_computer_systems.html?id=LgpKodW460oC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "real-time" is also used in [[Computer simulation|simulation]] to mean that the simulation's clock runs at the same speed as a real clock, and in [[Industrial control system|process control]] and [[enterprise system]]s to mean "without significant delay".

Real-time software may use one or more of the following: [[synchronous programming language]]s, [[real-time operating system]]s, and real-time networks, each of which provide essential frameworks on which to build a real-time software application.

Systems used for many [[mission critical]] applications must be real-time, such as for control of [[fly-by-wire]] aircraft, or [[anti-lock brakes]] on a vehicle, which must produce maximum deceleration but intermittently stop braking to prevent skidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time processing ''fails'' if not completed within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always be met, regardless of [[Load (computing)|system load]].

== History ==
The term ''real-time'' derives from its use in early [[simulation]], in which a real-world process is simulated at a rate that matched that of the real process (now called [[real-time simulation]] to avoid ambiguity). [[Analog computer]]s, most often, were capable of simulating at a much faster pace than real-time, a situation that could be just as dangerous as a slow simulation if it were not also recognized and accounted for. &lt;!-- What does this mean? Where did "dangerous" become an issue? --&gt;&lt;!-- The historical origins of the term has no bearing on its current, correct, technical definition. ''Real-time'' does not refer to either fast or slow processing. In fact, the speed of processing is independent of whether it is considered ''real-time'' or not. For a system to be defined as ''real-time'' it must meet its time constraints — whether those constraints require extremely fast processing or can be met at a more leisurely pace has no bearing on the matter. --&gt;

Minicomputers, particularly in the 1970s onwards, when built into dedicated [[embedded system]]s such as DOG scanners, increased the need for low-latency priority-driven responses to important interactions with incoming data and so operating systems such as [[Data General]]'s [[Data General RDOS|RDOS (Real-Time Disk Operatings System)]] and RTOS with [[Foreground-background|background and foreground scheduling]] as well as [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[RT-11]] date from this era.  Background-foreground scheduling allowed low priority tasks CPU time when no foreground task needed to execute, and gave absolute priority within the foreground to threads/tasks with the highest priority.  Real-time operating systems would also be used for [[time-sharing]] multiuser duties. For example, [[Data General Business Basic]] could run in the foreground or background of RDOG (and would introduce additional elements to the scheduling algorithm to make it more appropriate for people interacting via [[dumb terminal]]s.

Once  when the [[MOS Technology 6502]] (used in the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]]), and later when the [[Motorola 68000]] (used in the [[Macintosh]], [[Atari ST]], and [[Commodore Amiga]]) were popular, anybody could use their home computer as a real-time system. The possibility to deactivate other interrupts allowed for hard-coded loops with defined timing, and the low [[interrupt latency]] allowed the implementation of a real-time operating system, giving the user interface and the disk drives lower priority than the real-time thread. Compared to these the [[programmable interrupt controller]] of the Intel CPUs (8086..80586) generates a very large latency and the Windows operating system is neither a real-time operating system nor does it allow a program to take over the CPU completely and use its own [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]], without using native machine language and thus surpassing all interrupting Windows code. However, several coding libraries exist which offer real time capabilities in a high level language on a variety of operating systems, for example [[Real time Java|Java Real Time]]. The [[Motorola 68000]] and subsequent family members (68010, 68020 etc.) also became popular with manufacturers of industrial control systems. This application area is one in which real-time control offers genuine advantages in terms of process performance and safety.{{citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=This whole paragraph contains several questionable statements in regard to MOS, AMD and Motorola CPUs and their interrupt handling, and therefore needs to be rewritten and sourced by reliable sources.}}

== {{anchor|Hard|Firm|Require|Soft}}Criteria for real-time computing ==
A system is said to be ''real-time'' if the total correctness of an operation depends not only upon its logical correctness, but also upon the time in which it is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shin | first = K.G. | last2 = Ramanathan | first2 = P. | title = Real-time computing: a new discipline of computer science and engineering | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages =  6–24 | publisher = [[IEEE]] | date = Jan 1994 | issn = 0018-9219 | doi = 10.1109/5.259423| url = http://kabru.eecs.umich.edu/papers/publications/1994/ramanathan-shin-ieee-proceedings.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time systems, as well as their deadlines, are classified by the consequence of missing a deadline:
* ''Hard''{{snd}} missing a deadline is a total system failure.
* ''Firm''{{snd}} infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may degrade the system's quality of service. The usefulness of a result is zero after its deadline.
* ''Soft''{{snd}} the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline, thereby degrading the system's quality of service.

Thus, the goal of a ''hard real-time system'' is to ensure that all deadlines are met, but for ''soft real-time systems'' the goal becomes meeting a certain subset of deadlines in order to optimize some application-specific criteria. The particular criteria optimized depend on the application, but some typical examples include maximizing the number of deadlines met, minimizing the lateness of tasks and maximizing the number of high priority tasks meeting their deadlines.

Hard real-time systems are used when it is imperative that an event be reacted to within a strict deadline. Such strong guarantees are required of systems for which not reacting in a certain interval of time would cause great loss in some manner, especially damaging the surroundings physically or threatening human lives (although the strict definition is simply that missing the deadline constitutes failure of the system). For example, a [[automobile|car]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] control system is a hard real-time system because a delayed signal may cause engine failure or damage. Other examples of hard real-time embedded systems include medical systems such as heart [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]]s and industrial process controllers. Hard real-time systems are typically found interacting at a low level with physical hardware, in [[embedded system]]s. Early video game systems such as the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Cinematronics]] vector graphics had hard real-time requirements because of the nature of the graphics and timing hardware.

In the context of [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] systems the [[scheduling policy]] is normally priority driven ([[Preemptive multitasking|pre-emptive]] schedulers).  Other scheduling algorithms include [[Earliest deadline first scheduling|earliest deadline first]], which, ignoring the overhead of [[context switch]]ing, is sufficient for system loads of less than 100%.&lt;ref&gt;C. Liu and J. Layland. Scheduling Algorithms for Multiprogramming in a Hard Real-time Environment. Journal of the ACM, 20(1):46--61, Jan. 1973. http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/liu73scheduling.html&lt;/ref&gt; New overlay scheduling systems, such as an [[adaptive partition scheduler]] assist in managing large systems with a mixture of hard real-time and non real-time applications.

Soft real-time systems are typically used to solve issues of concurrent access and the need to keep a number of connected systems up-to-date through changing situations.  An example can be software that maintains and updates the flight plans for commercial [[airline]]rs: the flight plans must be kept reasonably current, but they can operate with the latency of a few seconds. Live audio-video systems are also usually soft real-time; violation of constraints results in degraded quality, but the system can continue to operate and also recover in the future using workload prediction and reconfiguration methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Real-time reconfiguration for guaranteeing QoS provisioning levels in Grid environments | journal = Future Generation Computer Systems | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 779–784 | publisher = Elsevier | date = July 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2008.11.001 | doi = 10.1016/j.future.2008.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real-time in digital signal processing ===
In a real-time [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) process, the analyzed (input) and generated (output) samples can be processed (or generated) continuously in the time it takes to input and output the same set of samples ''independent'' of the processing delay.&lt;ref name="Kuo-Lee-Tian"&gt;S.M. Kuo, B.H. Lee, and W. Tian, "Real-Time Digital Signal Processing: Implementations and Applications", Wiley, 2006. {{ISBN|0-470-01495-4}}. [http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/54/04700149/0470014954.pdf Section 1.3.4: ''Real-Time Constraints''].&lt;/ref&gt; It means that the processing delay must be bounded even if the processing continues for an unlimited time. That means that the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] processing time per sample, including [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]], is no greater than the sampling period, which is the reciprocal of the [[sampling rate]]. This is the criterion whether the samples are grouped together in large segments and processed as blocks or are processed individually and whether there are long, short, or non-existent [[data buffer|input and output buffers]].

Consider an [[Audio signal processing|audio DSP]] example; if a process requires 2.01 seconds to [[Audio analysis|analyze]], [[Sound synthesis|synthesize]], or process 2.00 seconds of sound, it is not real-time. However, if it takes 1.99 seconds, it is or can be made into a real-time DSP process.

A common life analog is standing in a line or [[Queue area|queue]] waiting for the checkout in a grocery store. If the line asymptotically grows longer and longer without bound, the checkout process is not real-time. If the length of the line is bounded, customers are being "processed" and output as rapidly, on average, as they are being inputted and that process ''is'' real-time. The grocer might go out of business or must at least lose business if they cannot make their checkout process real-time; thus, it is fundamentally important that this process is real-time.

A signal processing algorithm that cannot keep up with the flow of input data with output falling farther and farther behind the input is not real-time.  But if the delay of the output (relative to the input) is bounded regarding a process that operates over an unlimited time, then that signal processing algorithm is real-time, even if the throughput delay may be very long.

==== Live vs. real-time ====

Real-time signal processing is necessary, but not sufficient in and of itself, for live signal processing such as what is required in [[live event support]]. Live audio digital signal processing requires both real-time operation and a sufficient limit to throughput delay so as to be tolerable to performers using [[stage monitor]]s or [[in-ear monitor]]s and not noticeable as [[lip sync error]] by the audience also directly watching the performers.  Tolerable limits to latency for live, real-time processing is a subject of investigation and debate but is estimated to be between 6 and 20 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kudrle|first1=Sara|last2=Proulx|first2=Michel|last3=Carrieres|first3=Pascal|last4=Lopez|first4=Marco|title=Fingerprinting for Solving A/V Synchronization Issues within Broadcast Environments|journal=SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal|date=July 2011|volume=120|issue=5|pages=36–46|doi=10.5594/j18059XY|quote=Appropriate A/V sync limits have been established and the range that is considered acceptable for film is +/- 22 ms. The range for video, according to the ATSC, is up to 15 ms lead time and about 45 ms lag time|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-time bidirectional [[G.114|telecommunications delays]] of less than 300 ms ("round trip" or twice the unidirectional delay) are considered "acceptable" to avoid undesired "talk-over" in conversation.

== Real-time and high-performance ==
Real-time computing is sometimes misunderstood to be [[high-performance computing]], but this is not an accurate classification.&lt;ref name="Stankovic1988"&gt;{{Citation |title=Misconceptions about real-time computing: a serious problem for next-generation systems |author=John Stankovic |year=1988 |periodical=Computer |volume=21 |issue=10 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |doi=10.1109/2.7053 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a massive [[supercomputer]] executing a scientific simulation may offer impressive performance, yet it is not executing a real-time computation. Conversely, once the hardware and software for an anti-lock braking system have been designed to meet its required deadlines, no further performance gains are obligatory or even useful. Furthermore, if a network server is highly loaded with network traffic, its response time may be slower but will (in most cases) still succeed before it times out (hits its deadline). Hence, such a network server would not be considered a real-time system: temporal failures (delays, time-outs, etc.) are typically small and compartmentalized (limited in effect) but are not catastrophic failures. In a real-time system, such as the [[FTSE 100 Index]], a slow-down beyond limits would often be considered catastrophic in its application context. Therefore, the most important requirement of a real-time system is predictability and not performance.

Some kinds of software, such as many [[Computer chess|chess-playing programs]], can fall into either category.  For instance, a chess program designed to play in a tournament with a clock will need to decide on a move before a certain deadline or lose the game, and is therefore a real-time computation, but a chess program that is allowed to run indefinitely before moving is not.  In both of these cases, however, high performance is desirable: the more work a tournament chess program can do in the allotted time, the better its moves will be, and the faster an unconstrained chess program runs, the sooner it will be able to move.  This example also illustrates the essential difference between real-time computations and other computations: if the tournament chess program does not make a decision about its next move in its allotted time it loses the game—i.e., it fails as a real-time computation—while in the other scenario, meeting the deadline is assumed not to be necessary.  High-performance is indicative of the amount of processing that is performed in a given amount of time, whereas real-time is the ability to get done with the processing to yield a useful output in the available time.

== {{Anchor|Near real-time}}Near real-time ==
The term "near real-time"  or "nearly real-time" (NRT), in [[telecommunication]]s and [[computing]], refers to the time [[Network delay|delay]] introduced, by automated [[data processing]] or [[telecommunications network|network]] transmission, between the occurrence of an event and the use of the processed data, such as for display or [[feedback]] and control purposes. For example, a near-real-time display depicts an event or situation as it existed at the current time minus the processing time, as nearly the time of the live event.&lt;ref name=1037C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm |title=Federal Standard 1037C: Glossary of Telecommunications Terms |publisher=Its.bldrdoc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between the terms "near real time" and "real time" is somewhat nebulous and must be defined for the situation at hand. The term implies that there are no significant delays.&lt;ref name=1037C/&gt; In many cases, processing described as "real-time" would be more accurately described as "near real-time".

Near real-time also refers to delayed real-time transmission of voice and video. It allows playing video images, in approximately real-time, without having to wait for an entire large video file to download. Incompatible databases can export/import to common flat files that the other database can import/export on a scheduled basis so that they can sync/share common data in "near real-time" with each other.

The distinction between "near real-time" and "real-time" varies, and the delay is dependent on the type and speed of the transmission. The delay in near real-time is typically of the order of several seconds to several minutes.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Design methods==
Several methods exist to aid the design of real-time systems, an example of which is [[Modular Approach to Software Construction Operation and Test|MASCOT]], an old but very successful method which represents the [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] structure of the system. Other examples are [[HOOD method|HOOD]], Real-Time UML, [[Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language|AADL]], the [[Ravenscar profile]], and [[Real time Java|Real-Time Java]].

'''Real-time locating systems''' ('''RTLS''') are used to automatically [[Automatic identification and data capture|identify]] and [[tracking system|track]] the location of objects or people in [[Real-time computing|real time]], usually within a building or other contained area.  Wireless RTLS tags are attached to objects or worn by people, and in most RTLS, fixed reference points receive wireless signals from tags to determine their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org |title=International Organization for Standardization |publisher=ISO |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of real-time locating systems include tracking automobiles through an assembly line, locating pallets of merchandise in a warehouse, or finding medical equipment in a hospital.

The physical layer of RTLS technology is usually some form of [[radio frequency]] (RF) communication, but some systems use optical (usually [[infrared]]) or acoustic (usually [[ultrasound]]) technology instead of or in addition to RF.  Tags and fixed reference points can be transmitters, receivers, or both, resulting in numerous possible technology combinations.

RTLS are a form of local positioning system, and do not usually refer to GPS or to [[mobile phone tracking]].  Location information usually does not include speed, direction, or spatial orientation.

==Origin==
The term RTLS was created (circa 1998) at the  [[ID EXPO]] trade show by Tim Harrington (WhereNet), Jay Werb, (PinPoint), and Bert Moore, (Automatic Identification Manufacturers, Inc.(AIM)). It was created to describe and differentiate an [[emerging technology]] that not only provided the automatic identification capabilities of active [[RFID]] tags, but also added the ability to view the location on a computer screen. It was at this show that the first examples of a commercial radio based RTLS system were shown by PinPoint and WhereNet. Although this capability had been utilized previously by military and government agencies, the technology had been too expensive for commercial purposes. In the early 1990s, the first commercial RTLS were installed at three healthcare facilities in the United States, and were based on the transmission and decoding of [[infrared light]] signals from actively transmitting tags.  Since then, new technology has emerged that also enables RTLS to be applied to passive tag applications.

==Locating concepts==
RTLS are generally used in indoor and/or confined areas, such as buildings, and do not provide global coverage like [[global positioning system|GPS]]. RTLS tags are affixed to mobile items to be tracked or managed. RTLS reference points, which can be either transmitters or receivers, are spaced throughout a building (or similar area of interest) to provide the desired tag coverage. In most cases, the more RTLS reference points that are installed, the better the location accuracy, until the technology limitations are reached.

A number of disparate system designs are all referred to as "real-time locating systems", but there are two primary system design elements:

===Locating at choke points===
The simplest form of [[choke point]] locating is where short range ID signals from a moving tag are received by a single fixed reader in a sensory network, thus indicating the location coincidence of reader and tag.  Alternately, a choke point identifier can be received by the moving tag, and then relayed, usually via a second wireless channel, to a location processor.  Accuracy is usually defined by the sphere spanned with the reach of the choke point transmitter or receiver.  The use of directional antennas, or technologies such as infrared or [[ultrasound]] that are blocked by room partitions, can support choke points of various geometries.

===Locating in relative coordinates===
ID signals from a tag is received by a multiplicity of readers in a [[sensory network]], and a position is estimated using one or more locating algorithms, such as [[trilateration]], [[multilateration]], or [[triangulation]].  Equivalently, ID signals from several RTLS reference points can be received by a tag, and relayed back to a location processor.  Localization with multiple reference points requires that distances between reference points in the sensory network be known in order to precisely locate a tag, and the determination of distances is called [[ranging]].

Another way to calculate relative location is if [[Mobile tagging|mobile tags]] communicate directly with each other, then relay this information to a location processor.

===Location accuracy===
RF [[trilateration]] uses estimated ranges from multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. RF [[triangulation]] uses the angles at which the RF signals arrive at multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. Many obstructions, such as walls or furniture, can distort the estimated range and angle readings leading to varied qualities of location estimate. Estimation-based locating is often measured in accuracy for a given distance, such as 90% accurate for 10 meter range.

Systems that use locating technologies that do not go through walls, such as infrared or ultrasound, tend to be more accurate in an indoor environment because only tags and receivers that have line of sight (or near line of sight) can communicate.

==Applications==
RTLS can be used numerous logistical or operational areas such as:
* locate and manage assets within a facility, such as finding a misplaced tool cart in a warehouse or medical equipment
* notification of new locations, such as an alert if a tool cart improperly has left the facility
* to combine identity of multiple items placed in a single location, such as on a pallet
* to locate customers, for example in a restaurant, for delivery of food or service
* to maintain proper staffing levels of operational areas, such as ensuring guards are in the proper locations in a correctional facility
* to quickly and automatically account for all staff after or during an emergency evacuation
* to automatically track and time stamp the progress of people or assets through a process, such as following a patient's emergency room wait time, time spent in the operating room, and total time until discharge.  Such a system can be used for process improvement
* clinical-grade locating to support acute care capacity management

==Privacy concerns==
RTLS may be seen as a threat to [[privacy]] when used to determine the location of people.  The newly declared human right of [[informational self-determination]] gives the right to prevent one's identity and [[personal data]] from being disclosed to others, and also covers disclosure of locality, though this does not generally apply to the [[workplace privacy|workplace]].

Several prominent labor unions have come out against the use of RTLS systems to track workers calling them "the beginning of [[Authoritarian personality|Big Brother]]" and "an [[invasion of privacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coren |first=Michael J. |url=http://www.nextgov.com/health/2011/12/vas-real-time-location-system-a-way-to-improve-patient-safety-or-big-brother/50231/ |title=VA's Real-Time Location System: A way to improve patient safety, or Big Brother? |website=Nextgov.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common strategy to overcome opposition to these systems is often similar to the following. However, this loss of privacy may be outweighed by other benefits to staff. For example, Toronto General Hospital is looking at RTLS to reduce quarantine times after an infectious disease outbreak.&lt;ref name="toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/9266/1/1/ |title=Toronto General Hospital Uses RTLS to Reduce Infection Transmission |publisher=RFID Journal |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a recent SARS outbreak, 1% of all staff were quarantined, and more accurate data regarding who had been exposed to the virus could have reduced the need for quarantines.&lt;ref name="toronto"/&gt;

A general model for selection of the best solution for a locating problem has been constructed at the Radboud University of Nijmegen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positioningtechniques.eu |title=Positioning techniques : A general model |publisher=Radboud University of Nijmegen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these references do not comply with the definitions given in international standardization with ISO/IEC 19762-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50718 |title=ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008 - Information technology - Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques - Harmonized vocabulary - Part 5: Locating systems |website=Iso.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO/IEC 24730-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38840 |title=ISO/IEC 24730-1:2006 - Information technology - Real-time locating systems (RTLS) - Part 1: Application program interface (API) |website=Iso.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some aspects of real-time performance are served and aspects of locating are addressed in context of absolute coordinates.

==Ranging and angulating==
Depending on the physical technology used, at least one and often some combination of ranging and/or angulating methods are used to determine location:
* [[Angle of arrival]] (AoA)
* [[Line-of-sight propagation|Line-of-sight]] (LoS)
* [[Time of arrival]] (ToA)
* [[Multilateration]] (Time difference of arrival) (TDoA)
* [[Time-of-flight]] (ToF)
* [[Symmetrical Double Sided – Two Way Ranging|Two-way ranging]] (TWR) according to Nanotron’s patents
* [[Symmetrical Double Sided – Two Way Ranging]] (SDS-TWR)
* [[Near-field electromagnetic ranging]] (NFER)

==Errors and accuracy==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
Real-time locating is affected by a variety of errors. Many of the major reasons relate to the physics of the locating system, and may not be reduced by improving the technical equipment.

;None or no direct response

Many RTLS systems require direct and clear line of sight visibility. For those systems, where there is no visibility from mobile tags to fixed nodes there will be no result or a non valid result from [[locating engine]]. This applies to satellite locating as well as other RTLS systems such as angle of arrival and time of arrival. Fingerprinting is a way to overcome the visibility issue: If the locations in the tracking area contain distinct measurement fingerprints, line of sight is not necessarily needed. For example, if each location contains a unique combination of signal strength readings from transmitters, the location system will function properly. This is true, for example, with some Wi-Fi based RTLS solutions. However, having distinct signal strength fingerprints in each location typically requires a fairly high saturation of transmitters.

;False location

The measured location may appear entirely faulty. This is a generally result of simple operational models to compensate for the plurality of error sources. It proves impossible to serve proper location after ignoring the errors.

;Locating backlog

''Real time'' is no registered branding and has no inherent quality. A variety of offers sails under this term. As motion causes location changes, inevitably the latency time to compute a new location may be dominant with regard to motion. Either an RTLS system that requires waiting for new results is not worth the money or the operational concept that asks for faster location updates does not comply with the chosen systems approach.

;Temporary location error

Location will never be reported ''exactly'', as the term ''real-time'' and the term ''precision'' directly contradict in aspects of measurement theory as well as the term ''precision'' and the term ''cost'' contradict in aspects of economy. That is no exclusion of precision, but the limitations with higher speed are inevitable.

;Steady location error

Recognizing a reported location steadily apart from physical presence generally indicates the problem of insufficient over-determination and missing of visibility along at least one link from resident anchors to mobile transponders. Such effect is caused also by insufficient concepts to compensate for calibration needs.

;Location jitter

Noise from various sources has an erratic influence on stability of results. The aim to provide a steady appearance increases the latency contradicting to real time requirements.

;Location jump

As objects containing mass have limitations to jump, such effects are mostly beyond physical reality. Jumps of reported location not visible with the object itself generally indicate improper modeling with the location engine. Such effect is caused by changing dominance of various secondary responses.

;Location creep

Location of residing objects gets reported moving, as soon as the measures taken are biased by secondary path reflections with increasing weight over time.  Such effect is caused by simple averaging and the effect indicates insufficient discrimination of first echoes.

==Standards==

===ISO/IEC===
The basic issues of RTLS are standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and the International Electrotechnical Commission, under the ISO/IEC 24730 series. In this series of standards, the basic standard ISO/IEC 24730-1 identifies the terms describing a form of RTLS used by a set of vendors, but does not encompass the full scope of RTLS technology.

Currently several standards are published:
* ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008 Information technology &amp;mdash; Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques &amp;mdash; Harmonized vocabulary—Part 5: Locating systems
* ISO/IEC 24730-1:2014 Information technology &amp;mdash; [[Real-time locating]] systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 1: Application programming interface (API)
* ISO/IEC 24730-2:2012 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 2: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4&amp;nbsp;GHz air interface protocol
* ISO/IEC 24730-5:2010 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real-time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 5: Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) at 2,4&amp;nbsp;GHz air interface
* ISO/IEC 24730-21:2012 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 21: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4&amp;nbsp;GHz air interface protocol: Transmitters operating with a single spread code and employing a DBPSK data encoding and BPSK spreading scheme
* ISO/IEC 24730-22:2012 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 22: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4&amp;nbsp;GHz air interface protocol: Transmitters operating with multiple spread codes and employing a QPSK data encoding and Walsh offset QPSK (WOQPSK) spreading scheme
* ISO/IEC 24730-61:2013 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 61: Low rate pulse repetition frequency Ultra Wide Band (UWB) air interface
* ISO/IEC 24730-62:2013 Information technology &amp;mdash; Real time locating systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 62: High rate pulse repetition frequency Ultra Wide Band (UWB) air interface

These standards do not stipulate any special method of computing locations, nor the method of measuring locations. This may be defined in specifications for [[trilateration]], [[triangulation]] or any hybrid approaches to trigonometric computing for planar or spherical models of a terrestrial area.

===INCITS===
* INCITS 371.1:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 1: 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz Air Interface Protocol
* INCITS 371.2:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 2: 433-MHz Air Interface Protocol
* INCITS 371.3:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 3: Application Programming Interface

==Limitations and further discussion==
In RTLS application in the Healthcare industry, various studies were issued discussing the limitations of the currently adopted RTLS. Currently used technologies RFID, Wi-fi, UWB, all RFID based are hazardous in the sense of interference with sensitive equipment. A study carried out by Dr Erik Jan van Lieshout of the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam published in ''JAMA'' (''Journal of the American Medical Equipment'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182113 |title=JAMA Network &amp;#124; JAMA &amp;#124; Electromagnetic Interference From Radio Frequency Identification Inducing Potentially Hazardous Incidents in Critical Care Medical Equipment |website=Jama.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed "RFID and UWB could shut down equipment patients rely on" as "RFID caused interference in 34 of the 123 tests they performed". The first Bluetooth RTLS provider in the medical industry is supporting this in their article: "The fact that RFID cannot be used near sensitive equipment should in itself be a red flag to the medical industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locatible.com/blog/rfid-and-uwb-dead-medical-industry/ |title=RFID Dead in the Medical Industry? &amp;#124; |website=Locatible.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFID Journal responded to this study not negating it rather explaining real-case solution: "The Purdue study showed no effect when ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) systems were kept at a reasonable distance from medical equipment. So placing readers in utility rooms, near elevators and above doors between hospital wings or departments to track assets is not a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4198 |title=Good and Bad News About RFID in Hospitals |publisher=RFID Journal |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the case of ”keeping at a reasonable distance” might be still an open question for the RTLS technology adopters and providers in medical facilities.

In many applications it is very difficult and at the same time important to make a proper choice among various communication technologies (e.g., RFID, WiFi, etc.) which RTLS may include. Wrong design decision made at early stages can lead to catastrophic results for the system and a significant loss of money for fixing and redesign. To solve this problem a special methodology for RTLS design space exploration was developed. It consists of such steps as modelling, requirements specification and verification into a single efficient process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13659/metodika_izucheniya_prostranstva_proektnyh_resheniydlya_sistem_pozicionirovaniya_obektov_v_realnom_vremeni.htm|title=A methodology for design space exploration of real-time location systems.|author1=Kirov D.A. |author2=Passerone R. |author3=Ozhiganov A.A. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=551–567 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network '''routing in a cellular network''' deals with the challenges of traditional [[telephony]] such as switching and call setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsp/article.php/3607381/Networking-101-Understanding-Routing.htm | title=Networking and Understanding Routing | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[cellular network]] routing issues in different cells can be attributed to the multiple access methods used for transmission. The location of each mobile phone must be known to reuse a given band of frequencies in different cells and forms [[space-division multiple access]] (SDMA).

==Networks==
[[FDMA]] is one of the multiple access methods used in cellular networks. 50&amp;nbsp;MHz blocks of communication channel are assigned, which lie in radio frequency range and contain an equal number of uplinks (terminal to base station) and downlinks (base station to terminal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenetworkencyclopedia.com/entry/frequency-division-multiple-access-fdma/ | title=Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and cellular phone technology | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more bidirectional channels are carried by 10-90 band pairs. The digital networks additionally make use of either [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] methods.

===Handover and roaming===
A special service called [[mobility management]] provides this application. Terminals (handsets) can move from one place to another during the call and therefore requires the call to be [[Handover|handed over]] from one channel to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itsec.rwth-aachen.de/publications/dis_ulrike_meyer.pdf | title=Secure Roaming and Handover Procedures in Wireless Access Net works | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft handover uses the same frequency channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://morse.colorado.edu/~tlen5510/text/classwebch2.html | title=Cellular systems and frequency reuse | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same terminals can operate in the same area covered by different service providers, which is known as [[roaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ustudy.in/node/7179 | title=Roaming and Handoff | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of single-source publishing primarily relate to the editor rather than the [[User (computing)|user]]. The user benefits from the consistency that single-sourcing brings to terminology and information. This assumes the content manager has applied an organized [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]] to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful).&lt;ref name=petra/&gt; Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with '''multi-channel publishing''' though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.&lt;ref name=mek&gt;[http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards Single-Source &amp; Multi-Channel Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406072258/http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards |date=2010-04-06 }}. © 2013 Mekon, accessed 23 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
While there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different [[file format]]s or human [[language]]s (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.&lt;ref name=mek/&gt;

==History==
The origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bob162&gt;Bob Boiko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6nUDn3ZaBoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Content Management Bible], pg. 162. [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780764583643}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the eclipsing of [[MS-DOS]] by [[graphical user interface]]s, help files went from being unreadable text along the bottom of the screen to hypertext systems such as [[WinHelp]]. On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of [[software documentation]] did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of [[electronic publishing]], but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.&lt;ref name=bob162/&gt;

The first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at [[Schneider Electric]] in [[Seligenstadt]], using software based on [[Interleaf]] to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=inCeft4AkXcC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge Strategies for Going Multilingual in a Global Age], pg. 227. Eds. Robert C. Sprung and Simone Jaroniec. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9789027231871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[XML]], developed during the mid- to late-1990s, was also significant to the development of single-source publishing as a method. XML, a markup language, allows developers to separate their documentation into two layers: a shell-like layer based on presentation and a core-like layer based on the actual written content. This method allows developers to write the content only one time while switching it in and out of multiple different formats and delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Wallace and Anthony Levinson, "The XML e-Learning Revolution: Is Your Production Model Holding You Back?" Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=4RK7tJ-OO3cC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Best of The eLearning Guild's Learning Solutions: Articles from the eMagazine's First Five Years], pg. 63. Ed. Bill Brandon. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. {{ISBN|9780470277157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, several firms began creating and using single-source content for technical documentation (Boeing Helicopter, Sikorsky Aviation and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) and user manuals (Ford owners manuals) based on tagged SGML and XML content generated using the Arbortext Epic editor with add-on functions developed by a contractor.  The concept behind this usage was that complex, hierarchical content that did not lend itself to discrete componentization could be used across a variety of requirements by tagging the differences within a single document using the capabilities built into SGML and XML.
Ford, for example, was able to tag its single owner's manual files so that 12 model years could be generated via a resolution script running on the single completed file.  Pratt &amp; Whitney, likewise, was able to tag up to 20 subsets of its jet engine manuals in single-source files, calling out the desired version at publication time.  World Book Encyclopedia also used the concept to tag its articles for American and British versions of English.

Starting from the early 2000s, single-source publishing was used with an increasing frequency in the field of [[technical translation]]. It is still regarded as the most efficient method of publishing the same material in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Esselink, "Localisation and translation." Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=a4W7lWgCqYoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Computers and Translation: A Translator's Guide], pg. 73. Ed. H. L. Somers. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2003. {{ISBN|9789027216403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a printed manual was translated, for example, the online help for the software program which the manual accompanies could be automatically generated using the method.&lt;ref&gt;Burt Esselink, ''A Practical Guide to Localization'', pg. 228. Volume 4 of Language international world directory. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9781588110060}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metadata]] could be created for an entire manual and individual pages or files could then be translated from that metadata with only one step, removing the need to recreate information or even database structures.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Hofmann and Thorsten Mehnert, "Multilingual Information Management at Schneider Automation." Taken from ''Translating Into Success'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although single-source publishing is now decades old, its importance has increased urgently as of the 2010s. As consumption of information products rises and the number of target audiences expands, so does the work of developers and content creators. Within the industry of software and its documentation, there is a perception that the choice is to embrace single-source publishing or render one's operations obsolete.&lt;ref name=cms/&gt;

==Criticism==
Editors using single-source publishing have been criticized for below-standard work quality, leading some critics to describe single-source publishing as the "conveyor belt assembly" of content creation.&lt;ref&gt;Mick Hiatt, [http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ The Myth of Single-Source Authoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929043721/http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ |date=2013-09-29 }}. Mashstream, November 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While heavily used in technical translation, there are risks of error in regard to [[Index (publishing)|indexing]]. While two words might be [[synonym]]s in English, they may not be synonyms in another language. In a document produced via single-sourcing, the index will be translated automatically and the two words will be rendered as synonyms. This is because they are synonyms in the [[Source language (translation)|source language]], while in the [[Target language (translation)|target language]] they are not.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Mulvany, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G0Eqm8FbiTMC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Indexing Books], pg. 154. 2nd ed.

Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.

Slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations common to those fields.

At its simplest, each number to be multiplied is represented by a length on a sliding ruler. As the rulers each have a logarithmic scale, it is possible to align them to read the sum of the logarithms, and hence calculate the product of the two numbers.

The Reverend [[William Oughtred]] and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on [[logarithms]] by [[John Napier]]. Before the advent of the [[electronic calculator]], it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and [[engineering]]. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as computers were being gradually introduced; but around 1974 the handheld electronic scientific calculator made them largely obsolete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Basic concepts ==
[[File:slide rule cursor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cursor on a slide rule]]
In its most basic form, the slide rule uses two [[logarithmic scale]]s to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate slide rules allow other calculations, such as [[square root]]s, [[exponential function|exponentials]], logarithms, and [[trigonometric function]]s.

Scales may be grouped in decades, which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus single decade scales C and D range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales A and B range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule.

In general, mathematical calculations are performed by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the [[product (mathematics)|product]], [[quotient]], or other calculated result.

The user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. [[Scientific notation]] is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.

Most slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length, aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.

Some slide rules ("duplex" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only ("simplex" rules). A sliding [[Wikt:cursor|cursor]] with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.

== Operation ==
[[File:pocket slide rule.jpg|frame|center|This slide rule is positioned to yield several values: From C scale to D scale (multiply by 2), from D scale to C scale (divide by 2), A and B scales (multiply and divide by 4), A and D scales (squares and square roots).]]

=== Multiplication ===
A logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules &lt;math&gt;\log(xy) = \log(x) + \log(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log(x/y) = \log(x) - \log(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Moving the top scale to the right by a distance of &lt;math&gt;\log(x)&lt;/math&gt;, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom, aligns each number &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, at position &lt;math&gt;\log(y)&lt;/math&gt; on the top scale, with the number at position &lt;math&gt;\log(x) + \log(y)&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom scale. Because &lt;math&gt;\log(x) + \log(y) = \log(xy)&lt;/math&gt;, this position on the bottom scale gives &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, the product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For example, to calculate 3×2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the "1" are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values:

[[File:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|550px]]

Operations may go "off the scale;" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively dividing by 10 (by subtracting the full length of the C-scale) and then multiplying by 7, as in the illustration below:

[[File:slide rule example3.svg]]

Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated (2/10)×7=0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:
# Use the double-decade scales A and B.
# Use the folded scales. In this example, set the left 1 of C opposite the 2 of D. Move the cursor to 7 on CF, and read the result from DF.
# Use the CI inverted scale. Position the 7 on the CI scale above the 2 on the D scale, and then read the result off of the D scale below the 1 on the CI scale. Since 1 occurs in two places on the CI scale, one of them will always be on-scale.
# Use both the CI inverted scale and the C scale. Line up the 2 of CI with the 1 of D, and read the result from D, below the 7 on the C scale.
# Using a circular slide rule.

Method 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.

=== Division ===
The illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.

[[File:slide rule example4.svg]]

=== Other operations ===
In addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]]s encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular were [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]], usually [[sine]] and [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]], [[common logarithm]] (log{{small|10}}) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), [[natural logarithm]] (ln) and [[exponential function|exponential]] (''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'') scales. Some rules include a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating [[hyperbolic functions]]. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A, B || two-decade logarithmic scales, used for finding square roots and squares of numbers
|-
| C, D || single-decade logarithmic scales
|-
| K || three-decade logarithmic scale, used for finding cube roots and cubes of numbers
|-
| CF, DF || "folded" versions of the C and D scales that start from [[Pi|π]] rather than from unity; these are convenient in two cases. First when the user guesses a product will be close to 10 but is not sure whether it will be slightly less or slightly more than 10, the folded scales avoid the possibility of going off the scale. Second, by making the start π rather than the square root of 10, multiplying or dividing by π (as is common in science and engineering formulas) is simplified.

The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/circular-man2.html|title=instruction manual |pages= 7–8|accessdate=March 14, 2007|work=sphere.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roots and powers ====
There are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.

For &lt;math&gt;x^y&lt;/math&gt; problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with ''x'' on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find ''y'' on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with ''x'' on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If ''y'' is "off the scale," locate &lt;math&gt;x^{y/2}&lt;/math&gt; and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.

To extract a cube root using a slide rule with only C/D and A/B scales, align 1 on the B cursor with the base number on the A scale (taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the A scale). Slide the cursor until the number on the D scale which is against 1 on the C cursor is the same as the number on the B cursor which is against the base number on the A scale. (Examples: A 8, B 2, C 1, D 2; A 27, B 3, C 1, D 3.)

==== Trigonometry ====
The S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.

For angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as &lt;math&gt;k\sin x&lt;/math&gt; can be read directly from ''x'' on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at&amp;nbsp;''k''. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/[[radian]]. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.

Many slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models, late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called ''decitrig'' models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.

==== Logarithms and exponentials ====
Base-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.

==== Addition and subtraction ====
Slide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquark.com/2005/01/slide-rule-tricks.html|title=AntiQuark: Slide Rule Tricks|work=antiquark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:

:&lt;math&gt;x + y = \left(\frac{x}{y} + 1\right) y.&lt;/math&gt;

For subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:

:&lt;math&gt;x - y = \left(\frac{x}{y} - 1\right) y.&lt;/math&gt;

This method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the [[logarithmic number system]] in specialized computer applications like the [[Gravity Pipe]] (GRAPE) supercomputer and [[hidden Markov models]].

The second method utilizes a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.

== Physical design ==

=== Standard linear rules ===
[[File:Teaching sliderule comparison.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} teaching slide rule compared to a normal sized model]]
The width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common "10-inch" models are actually 25&amp;nbsp;cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5&amp;nbsp;inches. Models a couple of metres wide were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two [[significant figures]], and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.

Various other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called "Darmstadt" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often "split" to get higher accuracy.

=== Circular slide rules ===
Circular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors, and another with a free dish and one cursor. The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.

The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by [[pi|π]]). For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;cm circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a 31.4&amp;nbsp;cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate "off-scale" calculations, because the scales were designed to "wrap around"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.&lt;ref&gt;At least one circular rule, a 1931 Gilson model, sacrificed some of the scales usually found in slide rules in order to obtain additional resolution in multiplication and division. It functioned through the use of a spiral C scale, which was claimed to be 50 feet and readable to five significant figures. See http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/gilson/gilson-manual2.jpg. A photo can be seen at http://www.hpmuseum.org/srcirc.htm. An instruction manual for the unit marketed by Dietzgen can be found at http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/SR_Library_General.htm. All retrieved March 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than "split" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale. Around 1970, an inexpensive model from B. C. Boykin (Model 510) featured 20 scales, including 50-inch C-D (multiplication) and log scales. The RotaRule featured a friction brake for the cursor.

The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.

One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the [[E6B]]. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with [[dead reckoning]]. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called "prayer wheel" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.

Proportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to calculate [[aspect ratio]]s. Lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window. They are not as common since the advent of computerized layout, but {{cns|are still made and used.&lt;!-- please add {{as of}} or equivalent when sourcing --&gt;|date=March 2018}}

In 1952, Swiss watch company [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a "navigation computer", featured [[airspeed]], [[rate of climb|rate]]/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer—[[nautical mile]] and gallon—liter fuel amount conversion functions.

=== Cylindrical slide rules ===
There are two main types of cylindrical slide rules: those with helical scales such as the Fuller, the [[Otis King]] and the [[Bygrave slide rule]], and those with bars, such as the Thacher and some Loga models. In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.

=== Materials ===
Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.

In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of [[celluloid]], plastic, or painted aluminium. Later cursors were [[acryl group|acrylics]] or [[polycarbonate]]s sliding on [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] bearings.

All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other [[resin]]. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful{{cn|date=April 2018}} slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} For painted slide rules, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== History ==
[[File:oughtred.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Oughtred]] (1575–1660), inventor of the slide rule]]
The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after [[John Napier]]'s publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]]. In 1620 [[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eq5kDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of Mathematics|last=Smith|first=David E.|date=1958|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486204307|location=|pages=205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In c. 1622, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k43Q9RHuGXgC&amp;lpg=PT831&amp;dq=William%20Oughtred%20circular%20rule&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT831#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Oughtred%20circular%20rule&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton|last=Applebaum|first=Wilbur|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135582555|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Slide Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over [[Scientific priority|priority]], with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.

In 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.

In 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a "polyphase" rule.

In 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.

In 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a "sliding rule" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.

In 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a nautical slide rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.&lt;ref&gt;"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule", ''The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine'', April 1845, p. 187 and Plate XX-B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern form ===
[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Engineer using a slide rule, with mechanical calculator in background, mid 20th century]]
A more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Amédée Mannheim]], "who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery." It was around this time that engineering became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe–but not in the United States.  There, Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by [[Keuffel and Esser Co.]] of New York.&lt;ref name="fn_3"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K&amp;EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |title=The Log-Log Duplex Decitrig Slide Rule No. 4081: A Manual |publisher=Keuffel &amp; Esser |first1=Lyman M. |last1=Kells |first2=Willis F. |last2=Kern |first3=James R. |last3=Bland |year=1943 |page=92 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214020502/http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K%26EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_4"&gt;''The Polyphase Duplex Slide Rule, A Self-Teaching Manual'', Breckenridge, 1922, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical work also required precise computations, and, in 19th-century Germany, a steel slide rule about two meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession in the same way the stethoscope is that of the medical profession.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]] bought two ''Nestler'' slide rules in the 1930s. Ten years later he brought them with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War II to work on the American space effort. Throughout his life he never used any other slide rule. He used his two Nestlers while heading the [[NASA]] program that landed a man on the moon in July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The first pocket calculator that could [[Calculator#Pocket calculators|replace the slide rule]] was the [[HP35]] introduced in 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium [[Pickett Incorporated|Pickett]]-brand slide rules were carried on [[Project Apollo]] space missions. The model N600-ES owned by [[Buzz Aldrin]] that flew with him to the moon on [[Apollo 11]] was sold at auction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://historical.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=669&amp;lotIdNo=41035 | title=Lot 25368 Buzz Aldrin's Apollo 11 Slide Rule - Flown to the Moon. ... 2007 September Grand Format Air &amp; Space Auction #669 | publisher=Heritage Auctions | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model N600-ES taken along on [[Apollo 13]] in 1970 is owned by the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19840160000 | title=Slide Rule, 5-inch, Pickett N600-ES, Apollo 13 | publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, a common sight on campuses even into the mid-1970s. Until the advent of the pocket digital calculator, students also might keep a ten- or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office&lt;ref&gt;Charles Overton Harris, ''Slide rule simplified'', American Technical Society, 1961, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.

In 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on ''[[prosthaphaeresis]]'', an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Specialized calculators ===
Slide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., but some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone &amp; Sons 1892 catalog lists a "Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge", a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.

There were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications; for example, the [[actinograph]] of [[Hurter and Driffield]] was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] from time of day, time of year, and latitude.

Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the [[Fisher Controls]] company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106031649/http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archivedate=6 January 2010 |title=Fisher sizing rules |accessdate=2009-10-06 |work=natgasedu.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot balloon slide rules were used by meteorologists in weather services to determine the upper wind velocities from an ascending hydrogen or helium filled pilot balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotballoon.com/slide.htm|title=Pilot Balloon Slide Rules|work=www.pilotballoon.com|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule "chassis" with an aluminium body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.

The [[E6B|E6-B]] is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigators.

Circular slide rules to estimate ovulation dates and fertility are known as ''wheel calculators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767050412331312200 | pmid=15061314 | title=Circle of time: errors in the use of the pregnancy wheel | journal=Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine | date=2003 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=370–372 | first=M.

=== Decline ===
[[File:TI-30 LED.png|150px|thumb|The [[TI-30]] scientific calculator was introduced for under US$25 in 1976 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|25|1976|r=2}}|0}} adjusted for inflation), signaling the end of the slide rule era.]]
The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but rare resource in the 1950s, became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. (See [[History of computing hardware (1960s–present)]].)

Another step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific calculators. The first included the [[Wang Laboratories]] [[Wang LOCI-2|LOCI-2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/wangloci.html|title=The Wang LOCI-2|work=oldcalculatormuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang Ad 1966"&gt;{{cite journal

The HP used the [[CORDIC]] (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm,&lt;ref name="Volder_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jack E. |last=Volder |title=The Birth of CORDIC |journal=Journal of VLSI Signal Processing |issn=0922-5773 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=101–105 |date=June 2000 |url=http://late-dpedago.urv.cat/site_media/papers/fulltext_2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064804/http://late-dpedago.urv.cat/site_media/papers/fulltext_2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-04 |access-date=2016-01-02 |doi=10.1023/a:1008110704586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.

As with mainframe computing, the availability of these machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule until cheap hand held scientific electronic calculators became available in the mid-1970s, at which point, it rapidly declined. 
The pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard [[HP-35]] scientific calculator was the first handheld device of its type, but it cost [[United States dollar|US$]]395 in 1972. This was justifiable for some engineering professionals but too expensive for most students. 
By 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and, by 1976, the [[TI-30]] scientific calculator was sold for less than $25.

Most people find slide rules difficult to learn and use. Even during their heyday, they never caught on with the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled," ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "The difficulty of learning to use slide rules discouraged their use among the hoi polloi. Yes, the occasional grocery store manager figured discounts on a slipstick, and this author once caught his high school English teacher calculating stats for trifecta horse-race winners on a slide rule during study hall. But slide rules never made it into daily life because you could not do simple addition and subtraction with them, not to mention the difficulty of keeping track of the decimal point. Slide rules remained tools for techies."&lt;/ref&gt; Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, George H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KIyAn_jTGUYC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;ots=QaPDD5V0BD&amp;dq=calculator%20%22slide%20rule%22%20training&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=slide%20rule&amp;f=false "Problem-based learning and the three C's of technology,"] ''The Power of Problem-Based Learning'', Barbara Duch, Susan Groh, Deborah Allen, eds., Stylus Publishing, LLC, 2001. "Numerical computations in freshman physics and chemistry were excruciating; however, this did not seem to be the case for those students fortunate enough to already own a calculator. I vividly recall that at the end of 1974, the students who were still using slide rules were given an additional 15 minutes on the final examination to compensate for the computational advantage afforded by the calculator, hardly adequate compensation in the opinions of the remaining slide rule practitioners."&lt;/ref&gt; This led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions, these approximations could lead to inaccuracies and mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled," ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "With computation moving literally at a hand's pace and the lack of precision a given, mathematicians worked to simplify complex problems. Because linear equations were friendlier to slide rules than more complex functions were, scientists struggled to linearize mathematical relations, often sweeping high-order or less significant terms under the computational carpet. So a car designer might calculate gas consumption by looking mainly at an engine's power, while ignoring how air friction varies with speed. Engineers developed shortcuts and rules of thumb. At their best, these measures led to time savings, insight and understanding. On the downside, these approximations could hide mistakes and lead to gross errors."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled", ''Scientific American'', May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "One effect was that users felt close to the numbers, aware of rounding-off errors and systematic inaccuracies, unlike users of today's computer-design programs. Chat with an engineer from the 1950s, and you will most likely hear a lament for the days when calculation went hand-in-hand with deeper comprehension. Instead of plugging numbers into a computer program, an engineer would understand the fine points of loads and stresses, voltages and currents, angles and distances. Numeric answers, crafted by hand, meant problem solving through knowledge and analysis rather than sheer number crunching."&lt;/ref&gt; A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed.

A slide rule requires the user to separately compute the [[order of magnitude]] of the answer in order to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5 × 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as 1,500,000 × 0.03 (which equals 45,000). This separate calculation is less likely to lead to extreme calculation errors, but forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short-term memory (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).

The typical [[arithmetic precision]] of a slide rule is about three [[significant digits]], compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of [[false precision]].

When performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.

Being entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on [[grid (electricity)|grid electricity]] or batteries. However, mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.

Many sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The [[E6B]] circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT is a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenwatch.com/en-us/watches/watch-detail/?model=JY0000-53E#filters=0000-53E|title=Citizen Watch Company – Citizen Eco-Drive / US, Canada, UK, IrelandCitizen Watch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=citizenwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faber Castell 6 inch slide rule.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Faber-Castell]] slide rule with pouch]]
Even today, some people prefer a slide rule over an electronic calculator as a practical computing device. Others keep their old slide rules out of a sense of nostalgia, or collect them as a hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A popular collectible model is the [[Keuffel &amp; Esser]] ''Deci-Lon'', a premium scientific and engineering slide rule available both in a ten-inch (25&amp;nbsp;cm) "regular" (''Deci-Lon 10'') and a five-inch "pocket" (''Deci-Lon 5'') variant. Another prized American model is the eight-inch (20&amp;nbsp;cm) Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, [[Faber-Castell]]'s high-end models are the most popular among collectors.

Although a great many slide rules are circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on [[:Category:online auction websites|online auction sites]] are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors' web sites. The Keuffel and Esser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic, because the end-pieces on the cursors, made of celluloid, tend to chemically break down over time.

There are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules. The Concise Company of Tokyo, which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in July 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Various slide rule simulator apps are available for Android and iOS-based smart phones and tablets.

Specialized slide rules such as the E6B used in aviation, and gunnery slide rules used in [[Gun laying|laying artillery]] are still used though no longer on a routine basis. These rules are used as part of the teaching and instruction process as in learning to use them the student also learns about the principles behind the calculations, it also allows the student to be able to use these instruments as a back up in the event that the modern electronics in general use fail.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===

Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

* [[Diffusion (business)|Technological diffusion]]
* [[Technology acceptance model]]
*[[Technology life cycle]]
* [[Technology transfer]]

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''''The Age of Plastic''''' is the debut studio album by the British [[New wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Buggles]], composed of [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Geoff Downes]]. The name of the record was conceived from the group's intention of being a "plastic group". The album has lyrical themes of nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. The titular song, "[[Living in the Plastic Age]]", views the experiences of watching media coverage of the [[Vietnam War]], while "Kid Dynamo" follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him. Described by writers as the first [[synthpop|technopop]] landmark,&lt;ref name ="Ianpeel"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buggles Rehearsal"/&gt; the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of [[disco]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[progressive rock]] and 1960s [[pop music]]. In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as "science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic." 

Horn used pre-dated technology for the album to have sounds unlike what was typical in records that were released at the time. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from [[Bruce Woolley]]. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at [[Sarm East Studios]]. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.

''The Age of Plastic'' was released by [[Island Records]] in Australia, January 1980, and later in February in the UK. The album's release followed the success of the group's 1979 first single, "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", which reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Most of the songs for the album were written during promotion of the song. Three subsequent singles, "The Plastic Age", "[[Clean, Clean]]" and "[[Elstree (song)|Elstree]]", all released in 1980, followed "Video", and also charted in the UK, reaching number 16, 38 and 55 respectively. In Europe, ''The Age of Plastic'' reached the Top 20 in Italy and the Top 40 in France, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In other continents, the album reached the top 40 most played in Japan and was number 83 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' albums chart. It has been met with positive critical response, with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre. There have been two reissues of the album, in 2000 and in 2010. A September 2010 performance of the album by the Buggles, a gig live at the "Ladbroke Grove's Supperclub" in [[Notting Hill, London]], marked the first time the group performed it in its entirety.

In 2016, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine called ''The Age of Plastic'' the 45th best new wave album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Josh (8 September 2016). [https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/the-best-new-wave-albums.html "The 50 Best New Wave Albums"]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''. Retrieved 9 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and production==

[[Geoff Downes]] formed [[The Buggles]] in 1977 in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], South West London with [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Bruce Woolley]].&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; The trio had done rough demos of early compositions such as "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", "[[Clean, Clean]]", and "[[On TV (song)|On TV]]", a track later included on their second album ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; Talking about the formation of the Buggles, Downes said about the demos: 
{{quote|“We’d sort out the songs at my place and do all the arrangements together. Later we’d kick the artist out of the studio and spent most of the studio time just doing different things of our own, using every moment to our best advantage. It was a big experience for both of us and after a couple of years of doing that, we had quite a few songs together... It was at that stage that we decided to become artists. We felt that it was about time that somebody started making good, well-produced pop records again. We wanted to give people something more than they already had.”&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt;}}

The Buggles were signed to [[Island Records]], who gave Horn and Downes recording and publishing contracts, and started recording their upcoming first studio album in the first half of 1979.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ztt.com/artists/the-buggles/|title=The Buggles|publisher=ZTT.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Woolley was originally intended to be the band's lead vocalist,&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; he left the group during the sessions to form his own band, The Camera Club, who also did versions of "Clean, Clean" and "Video" that appeared on their album ''English Garden''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; When "Video Killed the Radio Star" was a huge commercial success, they had realized the problem that they had not finished an album's worth of material yet, so they wrote more during the promotion of the single, while in airport lounges, dressing rooms, rehearsal rooms and studios.&lt;ref name = "Trevor Horn bio"&gt;Whitehouse, K.M.

''The Age of Plastic'' had a budget of £60,000.&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; Hugh Padgham recorded the backing tracks at Virgin's Town House in West London,&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt;&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Mark|title=Good vibrations: a history of record production|year=1998|publisher=Sanctuary|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to Sarm East's very small size and Horn wanting to record real drums.&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction/&gt; The Buggles went to London’s Wardour Street to gain the attention of two females to appear on the album.&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; The mixing and Horn's vocal recording were later done at [[Sarm East Studios]],&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deller, Fred|title=Life With the Buggles|work=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=32|date=21 February 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; and mixing was finished before Christmas 1979 for a new year's release of the album.&lt;ref name = "Japanese liner notes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Age of Plastic |others=The Buggles |year=2011 |chapter= |url= |accessdate= |first=Geoff |last=Downes |authorlink= |first2= |last2= |authorlink2= |page= |pages= |type= |publisher= |id=UICY-25077 |location=Japan |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarm East mixer [[Gary Langan]] used a 40-input Trident TSM console to record and mix the album, which was housed inside the same control room as two Studer A80 24-track machines and outboard gear that included an EMT 140 echo plate, Eventide digital delay, Eventide phaser, Marshall Time Modulator, Kepex noise gates, Urei and Orban EQs, and Urei 1176, Dbx 160, and UA LA2 and LA3 compressors.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt;

The vocals of the album were recorded at Sarm East to a click track using a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; As Langan recalls: "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push what we had to the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process."&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase."&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buskin, Richard|date=December 2011|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec11/articles/classic-tracks-1211.htm|title=The Buggles 'Video Killed The Radio Star'|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music development and arrangement==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "My stuff just sounded weird. I couldn’t make records like Elton John and I hated punk - I thought they were all shit musicians, although I grew to understand it in retrospect. I envied those guys who played with Elton John. They seemed so unassailable. What am I going to ever do that’s going to get close to that? I don’t have a great feel or a great blues voice. Then I heard [[Kraftwerk]]’s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and I thought, that’s it! A mechanised rhythm section, a band where you’re never old-fashioned, where you don’t have to emote. It sounded so new and exciting, so full of potential."

Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records released in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like [[Elton John]], which I couldn't because I couldn't figure out how they did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16046">'''Warp-field experiments''' are a series of current and proposed experiments to create and detect instances of [[spacetime]] warping. The ultimate goal is to prove or disprove the possibility of spacetime metric engineering with reasonable amounts of energy.

==Motivation==
[[File:Alcubierre.png|thumbnail|Visualisation of York time, a measurement of spacetime curvature as induced by the Alcubierre metric.]]
Spacetime metric engineering is a requirement for physically recreating solutions of general relativity such as [[Einstein–Rosen bridge]]s or the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Current experiments focus on the Alcubierre [[Metric (general relativity)|metric]] and its modifications. Alcubierre's work from 1994 implies that even if the required [[exotic matter]] with [[negative energy]] densities can be created, the total mass–energy demand for his proposed warp drive would exceed anything that could be realistically attained by human technology. Other researchers aimed to improve the energy efficiency (see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Alcubierre drive: Difficulties]]), however the propositions remain mostly speculative. Research groups at NASA's Johnsons Space Center and [[Dakota State University]] currently aim to experimentally evaluate several new approaches, especially a redesigned energy-density topology as well as an implication of [[brane cosmology]] theory.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt; If space actually were to be embedded in higher dimensions, the energy requirements could be decreased dramatically and a comparatively small energy density could already lead to a [[spacetime curvature]] measurable using an interferometer.&lt;ref name="WFM 102"&gt;{{cite web| last=White, Harold| title=Warp Field Mechanics 102: Energy Optimization| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20130011213| publisher=[[NASA Johnson Space Center]]|date=January 2013|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical framework for the experiments dates back to work by [[Harold G. White]] from 2003 as well as work by White and Eric W. Davis from 2006 that was published in the [[American Institute of Physics|AIP]], where they also consider how [[baryon]]ic matter could, at least mathematically, adopt characteristics of [[dark energy]] (see section below). In the process, they described how a toroidal positive energy density may result in a spherical negative-pressure region, possibly eliminating the need for actual exotic matter.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White101"&gt;{{cite web| last= Harold “Sonny” White| title=Warp Field Mechanics 101| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936_2011016932.pdf| publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center| date=2011-09-30| accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical framework==
The metric derived by [[Alcubierre drive|Alcubierre]] was mathematically motivated by [[cosmological inflation]]. The original "warp-drive" spacetime metric can be written in (t,x,y,z) coordinates as:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c dt^2 + [dx-v_s(t)f(r_s)dt]^2 +dy^2 +dz^2 &lt;/math&gt;

It uses the curve ([[world line]]) &lt;math&gt;x=x_s(t),y=0,z=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt; expresses the x-coordinate position of the moving spaceship frame.

The radius &lt;math&gt;r_s=[(x-x_s(t))^2+y^2+z^2]&lt;/math&gt; is the euclidean distance from the curve. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and &lt;math&gt;v_s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;dx_s/dt&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity associated with the curve.

The shaping function &lt;math&gt;f(r_s)&lt;/math&gt; is any smooth function that satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and decreases from the origin, vanishing at &lt;math&gt;r_s&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; for some point &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The driving phenomenon behind the apparently arbitrary velocity (including &lt;math&gt;v_s&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) could be (and was) postulated to be the York extrinsic time, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta=\frac{v_s}{c}\frac{x-x_s}{r_s}\frac{df}{dr_s}&lt;/math&gt;
It provides for the contraction of space in front, and expansion in the back of the warp bubble. The idea can be seen in some way as an applied extension of the hypothesis that the early universe also saw a rapid inflationary expansion that possibly exceeded the speed of light for some time. However, according to research,&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt; it appears that the York time behaviour is merely a side effect of another underlying mechanism. The problem that led to the assumption that York time is only one part in the larger picture is the unusual symmetry in the required energy density. Using the [[Einstein field equations]], the stress energy tensor  &lt;math&gt; T^{\mu\nu} &lt;/math&gt; can be derived from the Alcubierre metric, resulting in the necessary energy density:

[[File:Alcubierre energy density.GIF|thumb|right|The energy-density distribution around the x-axis derived from the [[Einstein field equations|EFE]]]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00}=-\left(\frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\right)\left[\frac{v_s^2(t)\rho^2}{4r_s^2c^2}\right]\left(\frac{df}{dr_s}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This corresponds to a negative toroidal energy density symmetric to the x-axis. It is notable here, that during a sensitivity analysis for the [[DARPA]]-funded [[100 Year Starship]] symposium, Harold White discovered that changing the energy-density distribution from a thin ring as originally proposed to more of a doughnut shape (effectively increasing the warp-bubble wall thickness) can decrease the required total negative energy by several orders of magnitude.

The symmetry in the energy distribution leads to the scenario in which the choice of positive x-axis is in fact arbitrary. The warp-drive mechanism would not know whether to go forward or backward along the x-axis. This paradox can be resolved by putting the Alcubierre metric into canonical form using Rindler's method and extracting the potential, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. With the potential it is possible to derive the field equation for the spacetime expansion "boost", &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="White101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteStEng" /&gt;
[[File:Spacetime expansion boost.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section of the boost topology throughout the sphere]]
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\cosh\left[\frac{1}{2}c^2\left(\ln\left|1-\left(\frac{v_s}{c}\right)^2f(r_s)\right|\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
The boost can roughly be seen as a scalar multiplier acting on an initial velocity leading to the actual warp-velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;v_s=\gamma \cdot v_{ini}&lt;/math&gt;
This boost is also an important analogy when considering higher-dimensional models (as seen below).
The expansion and contraction of space as measured by York time are now more of a secondary effect and can be considered equivalent to a pressure gradient of a moving sphere in a fluid. The scalar nature of the effect is an important clue when considering higher dimensions.
Considering the [[Geodesics in general relativity|null geodesics]] for &lt;math&gt;v_s&gt;c &lt;/math&gt; inside the warp field, it can be seen that the world lines are space-like for external observers, but the moving frame never travels outside its local comoving light cone and thus does not violate special relativity.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;

From there on, White and Davis showed similarities of the spacetime boost when considered in a higher-dimensional spacetime, such as in the Chung-Freese model. In this particular model our space exists on a [[Brane cosmology|brane]] and the space surrounding the brane is called the "bulk". The size of each extra dimension is considered to be at least finite and the latest research at CERN also constrains any large extra dimension theories.&lt;ref name="CERN" /&gt; However, the actual size and total number of extra dimensions is not important when considering the implications on the boost field. The modified [[Robertson–Walker metric]] representing the model by Chung and Freese is:&lt;ref name="Chung Freese Model" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-c^2dt^2+\frac{a(t)^2}{e^{2kU}}dX^2+dU^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;dX^2&lt;/math&gt; term specifies our normal space and &lt;math&gt;dU^2&lt;/math&gt; the higher-dimensional bulk with our space located at the &lt;math&gt;U=0&lt;/math&gt; plane.

&lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a typical cosmological expansion parameter (see [[accelerated expansion]]) and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary compactification factor for the extra dimensions. Considering the null geodesic solutions ( ds²=0 ) allows to develop the following relationship:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt}=\frac{ce^{kU}}{a(t)}\sqrt{1-\frac{dU^2}{c^2dt^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
For zero &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the expected speed of the photon is c, as expected. For large off-bulk coordinates &lt;math&gt;U&gt;&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; the speed &lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily large.

That means that light rays could have a spacelike appearance, an obvious parallel to the Alcubierre model. However, in the Alcubierre model the spacetime expansion boost is the driving phenomenon, whereas in the Chung–Freese model the off-brane bulk location U serves this purpose. It is thus theoretically possible that the boost of a 3+1 spacetime model is a scalar correction factor for higher-dimensional geometric effects on our brane, leading the following analogies to Alcubierre's model:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx e^U&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi\approx U&lt;/math&gt;  and thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\approx \frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

If a particle like an electron gains a high spacetime boost relative to an observer, it might actually leave the 3+1 brane (i.e. it gains non-zero U bulk coordinates) and its ability to interact electromagnetically diminishes. To illustrate this, White and Davis stated that in a 2D lab located at the x,y plane, a 2D electron that gets accelerated (obtains a high boost) gains a non-zero z coordinate. Thus, if a photon were to interact with it, it would need to be at the same (t,x,y,z) coordinate.

Considering the null geodesic equation again, one can see that if dU/dt=c, dX/dt=0 meaning that light comes to a standstill. This implies that a high hyperspace velocity reduces spacetime's "stiffness" or ability to resist being curved by energy, effectively reducing the energy requirements to warp it. This observation, together with the modified energy density distribution, first led researchers at NASA to begin thinking of testbeds to verify the new theoretical approach. Using the analogy between U and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, it is obvious that a high velocity (dU/dt) with U=0 requires a field oscillation.

Back in the Alcubierre model, it is notable that an outside observer would perceive a uniform potential (from the uniform boost within the sphere) that represents the warp-field region even though it originates from a toroidal energy density. It has similar characteristics as a  [[Gaussian surface|Gaussian spherical surface]] held at constant electrostatic potential. To the outside observer, the warp-field sphere has a uniform energy density. By expanding the spherical region while maintaining the same relative boost value for the Gaussian surface, when considering the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the following can be concluded (limited to the 3+1 brane):
:&lt;math&gt;dE=-p_sdV&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dE&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\rho_sdV&lt;/math&gt;, which is the total energy for the warp sphere with the same volume change &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; as on the right side of the equation.

Thus, the equation of state relating the pressure of the warp sphere &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; to its energy density &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_s=-p_s&lt;/math&gt;
which noticeably resembles the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of cosmological vacuum energy (moreover, it is the equation of state of dark energy). If &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; of the original warp sphere is negative, &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; would be positive. However the last equation shows that the opposite is true, &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is positive and &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; is negative. Considering that the spacetime expansion boost for the Alcubierre model can be made arbitrarily high depending on the choice of input variables, a high boost is thereby clearly not an exclusive feature common only to negative energy densities and could be obtained in the lab, provided powerful enough equipment.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;

==Difficulties==

Einstein's field equations show that comparatively high amounts of energy are required for any significant curvature of spacetime under ordinary conditions. With the energy-requirement-decreasing concepts only being partially implemented yet, the available measurement methods are reaching the limits of what is technically possible. That is why current results remain mostly inconclusive until measurements can be further refined or the effect can be increased. New experimental setups have been proposed to boost sensitivity, and using the higher-dimensional yet still purely theoretical approach may increase any effect sufficiently to obtain significant results to prove or disprove the theory.

==Current and proposed experiments==

{{main article|White–Juday warp-field interferometer}}
The only reported warp-field experiment currently being conducted is on a modified Michelson–Morley [[Interferometry|interferometer]] as proposed by Harold White and Eric Davis in 2003. This setup includes a ring-shaped energy device using high-voltage [[barium titanate|barium-titanate]] [[Capacitor|ceramic capacitors]] to attempt to warp space as shown in the diagram. White announced at a 2013 space conference that the first experimental results from this device were inconclusive.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;

A time-of-flight experiment was proposed in 2013 using a modified [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]].&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}{{clarify|date=November 2013}}
