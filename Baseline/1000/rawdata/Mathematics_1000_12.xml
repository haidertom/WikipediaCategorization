The '''Absolute Infinite''' (''symbol'': Ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]].

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal
 | author=Ignacio Jané
 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set
 | journal=Erkenntnis
 | volume=42 | issue=3 |date=May 1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/BF01129011 | quote=Cantor (1) took the absolute to be a manifestation of God [...] When the absolute is first introduced in Grundlagen, it is linked to God: "the true infinite or absolute, which is in God, admits no kind of determination" (Cantor 1883b, p. 175) This is not an incidental remark, for Cantor is very explicit and insistent about the relation between the absolute and God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: New Research and Frontiers'' by Michael Heller and W. Hugh Woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor said:

{{quote|The actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extraworldly existence, in Deo, where I call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. In the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, I call it ''[[Transfinite number|Transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf&lt;br/&gt;Translated quote from German: {{quote|Es wurde das Aktual-Unendliche (A-U.) nach drei Beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten Vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen Sein, in Deo realisiert ist, wo ich es Absolut Unendliches oder kurzweg Absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen Welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische Größe, Zahl oder Ordnungstypus vom Denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. In den beiden letzten Beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer Vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem Endlichen verwandtes A.-U. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''Transfinitum'' und setze es dem Absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[Ca-a, p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, {{ISBN|3-540-09849-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1962, pp. 443–447; translated into English in ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', ed. Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

An '''actuary''' is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of [[risk]] and uncertainty {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011a}}. The name of the corresponding field is [[actuarial science]]. These risks can affect both sides of the [[balance sheet]] and require [[investment management|asset management]], [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]] management, and valuation skills {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011b}}. Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms {{harv|Trowbridge|1989|p=7}}.

While the concept of insurance dates to antiquity ({{harvnb|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}}, {{harvnb|Loan|1992}}, {{harvnb|Lewin|2007|loc=pp. 3–4}}), the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities {{harv|Heywood|1985}}. Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011c}}. The [[Actuarial credentialing and exams|actual steps]] needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific; however, almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete ({{harvnb|Feldblum|2001|p=6}}, {{harvnb|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014}}).

The profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable {{harv|Riley|2013}}. In various studies, being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 ({{harvnb|Thomas|2012}}, {{harvnb|Weber|2013}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2015}}).

==Responsibilities==
&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: start --&gt;Actuaries use skills primarily in mathematics, particularly [[calculus]]-based [[probability]] and [[mathematical statistics]], but also [[economics]], [[computer science]], finance, and business. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance and reinsurance industries, either as staff employees or as consultants; to other businesses, including sponsors of pension plans; and to government agencies such as the [[Government Actuary's Department]] in the United Kingdom or the [[Social Security Administration]] in the United States of America. Actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner that will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis ({{harvnb|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}, {{harvnb|Government Actuary's Department|2015}})&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: end --&gt;.

===Disciplines===
Most traditional actuarial disciplines fall into two main categories: life and non-life.

Life actuaries, which include health and [[pension]] actuaries, primarily deal with [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk, [[morbidity]] risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include [[life insurance]], [[Life annuity|annuities]], pensions, short and long term [[disability insurance]], health insurance, [[health savings account]]s, and [[long-term care]] insurance {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}. In addition to these risks, social insurance programs are influenced by public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing [[demographics]], and other factors such as [[medical technology]], [[inflation]], and [[Cost-of-living index|cost of living]] considerations ({{harvnb|GAO|1980}}, {{harvnb|GAO|2008}}).

&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: start--&gt;Non-life actuaries, also known as property and casualty or general insurance actuaries, deal with both physical and legal risks that affect people or their property. Products prominent in their work include [[auto insurance]], [[home insurance|homeowners insurance]], commercial property insurance, [[workers' compensation]], [[malpractice]] insurance, [[Product liability|product liability insurance]], [[marine insurance]], [[terrorism insurance]], and other types of [[liability insurance]] {{harv|AIA|2014}}&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: end--&gt;.

Actuaries are also called upon for their expertise in [[enterprise risk management]] {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}. This can involve [[dynamic financial analysis]], [[stress testing#Financial sector|stress testing]], the formulation of corporate risk policy, and the setting up and running of corporate risk departments {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2011b}}. Actuaries are also involved in other areas of the [[financial services]] industry, such as analysing [[securities offering]]s or [[market research]] {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}.

===Traditional employment===
On both the life and casualty sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and [[Insurance#Indemnification|reserves]] for insurance policies covering various risks {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014|pp. = 12–14}}. On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying the probability of a loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity [[frequency distribution|distributions]] and the [[parameter]]s of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side {{harv|Tolley|Hickman|Lew|2012}}.

Actuaries do not always attempt to predict aggregate future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called [[Retrocession (Insurance)|retrospective reinsurance]], or the development or re-pricing of new products.

Actuaries also design and maintain products and systems. They are involved in financial reporting of companies' assets and liabilities. They must communicate complex concepts to clients who may not share their language or depth of knowledge. Actuaries work under a code of ethics that covers their communications and work products {{harv|ASB|2013}}.

===Non-traditional employment===
As an outgrowth of their more traditional roles, actuaries also work in the fields of risk management and [[enterprise risk management]] for both financial and non-financial corporations {{harv|D'Arcy|2005}}. Actuaries in traditional roles study and use the tools and data previously in the domain of finance {{harv|Feldblum|2001|p=8}}. The [[Basel II]] accord for financial institutions (2004), and its analogue, the [[Solvency II]] accord for insurance companies (to come into effect in 2016), require institutions to account for [[operational risk]] separately, and in addition to, [[credit risk|credit]], [[Actuarial reserves|reserve]], [[asset]], and [[insolvency]] risk. Actuarial skills are well suited to this environment because of their training in analyzing various forms of risk, and judging the potential for upside gain, as well as downside loss associated with these forms of risk {{harv|D'Arcy|2005}}.

&lt;!-- First two are from Mungan, last two are from Stefan --&gt;Actuaries are also involved in [[investment]] advice and [[asset management]], and can be general business managers and [[chief financial officer]]s&amp;nbsp;({{harvnb|Mungan|2002}}, {{harvnb|Stefan|2010}}). They analyze business prospects with their financial skills in valuing or discounting risky future cash flows, and apply their pricing expertise from insurance to other lines of business. For example, insurance [[securitization]] requires both actuarial and finance skills {{harv|Krutov|2006}}. Actuaries also act as [[expert witness]]es by applying their analysis in court trials to estimate the economic value of losses such as lost profits or lost wages {{harv|Wagner|2006}}.

==History==
[[File:Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838), American mathematician and actuary.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white picture of Nathaniel Bowditch, an eighteenth century American actuary|Mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]] was one of America's first insurance actuaries.]]

===Need for insurance===
The basic requirements of communal interests gave rise to risk sharing since the dawn of civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After [[barter (economics)|barter]] came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, which exposed them to [[financial risk]]. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=3}}.

===Early attempts===
In the ancient world there was not always room for the sick, suffering, disabled, aged, or the poor—these were often not part of the [[Collective consciousness|cultural consciousness]] of societies {{harv|Perkins|1995}}. Early methods of protection, aside from the normal support of the extended family, involved charity; religious organizations or neighbors would collect for the destitute and needy. By the middle of the 3rd century, 1,500 suffering people were being supported by charitable operations in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] {{harv|Perkins|1995}}. Charitable protection remains an active form of support in the modern era {{harv|GivingUSA|2009}}, but receiving charity is uncertain and is often accompanied by [[social stigma]]. Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions did arise in antiquity {{harv|Thucydides}}. Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund {{harv|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}}. Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and [[Life insurance|assurance]] pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society {{harv|Loan|1992}}.

Non-life insurance started as a hedge against loss of cargo during sea travel. Anecdotal reports of such guarantees occur in the writings of [[Demosthenes]], who lived in the 4th century BCE {{harv|Lewin|2007|pp=3–4}}. The earliest records of an official non-life insurance policy come from [[Sicily]], where there is record of a 14th-century contract to insure a shipment of wheat {{harv|Sweeting|2011|p=14}}. In 1350, Lenardo Cattaneo assumed "all risks from act of God, or of man, and from perils of the sea" that may occur to a shipment of wheat from Sicily to Tunis up to a maximum of 300 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s. For this he was paid a premium of 18% {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=4}}.

===Development of theory===
[[File:Excerpt from CDC 2003 Table 1.pdf|thumb|right|alt=A table of numbers; the first page of the U.S. 2003 mortality table.|2003 U.S. mortality ([[life table|life]]) table, Table 1, Page 1]]
&lt;!-- Sourced to Heywood: start --&gt;During the 17th century, a more scientific basis for [[risk management]] was being developed. In 1662, a London [[draper]] named [[John Graunt]] showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a defined group, or [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], of people, despite the uncertainty about the future longevity or mortality of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original [[life table]]. Combining this idea with that of [[compound interest]] and [[annuity]] valuation, it became possible to set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy each member's necessary contributions to a common fund, assuming a fixed rate of interest. The first person to correctly calculate these values was [[Edmond Halley]] {{harv|Heywood|1985}}&lt;!-- Sourced to Heywood: end --&gt;. In his work, Halley demonstrated a method of using his life table to calculate the premium someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life-annuity {{harv|Halley|1693}}.

&lt;!-- Ogborn 1956 p. 235: start --&gt;[[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]]'s pioneering work on the [[Whole life insurance#Level premium system|level premium system]] led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]]) in London in 1762. This was the first life insurance company to use premium rates that were calculated scientifically for long-term life policies, using Dodson's work. After Dodson's death in 1757, [[Edward Rowe Mores]] took over the leadership of the group that eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances. It was he who specified that the chief official should be called an ''actuary'' {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=235}}&lt;!-- Ogborn 1956 p. 235: end --&gt;. Previously, the use of the term had been restricted to an official who recorded the decisions, or ''acts'', of ecclesiastical courts, in ancient times originally the secretary of the [[Roman senate]], responsible for compiling the ''[[Acta Senatus]]'' {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=233}}. Other companies that did not originally use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=166}}.

===Development of the modern profession===
{{main|Actuarial science}}
[[File:Alliance for Health Reform briefing on the individual health insurance market (34370998252).jpg|thumb|upright|Actuary speaking at a health care event]]
In the 18th and 19th centuries, computational complexity was limited to manual calculations. The actual calculations required to compute fair insurance premiums are complex. The actuaries of that time developed methods to construct easily used tables, using sophisticated approximations called [[Actuarial science#Technological advances|commutation function]]s, to facilitate timely, accurate, manual calculations of premiums {{harv|Slud|2006}}. Over time, actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by ensuring competency and ethical standards {{harv|Hickman|2004|p=4}}. Since calculations were cumbersome, actuarial shortcuts were commonplace.

Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life compatriots in the early 20th century. In the United States, the 1920 revision to workers' compensation rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries {{harv|Michelbacher|1920|pp=224, 230}}. In the 1930s and 1940s, rigorous mathematical foundations for [[stochastic process]]es were developed {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=168}}. Actuaries began to forecast losses using models of random events instead of [[Deterministic system|deterministic methods]]. Computers further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to microcomputers, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has grown exponentially {{harv|MacGinnitie|1980|pp=50–51}}.

Another modern development is the convergence of modern [[finance theory|financial theory]] with actuarial science {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|pp=169–171}}. In the early 20th century, actuaries were developing techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition {{harv|Whelan|2002}}. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models {{harv|D'Arcy|1989}}. In the 21st century, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, combines tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory {{harv|Feldblum|2001|pp=8–9}}, but is still not completely aligned with modern [[financial economics]] {{harv|Bader|Gold|2003}}.

==Remuneration and ranking==
As there are relatively few actuaries in the world compared to other professions, actuaries are in high demand, and are highly paid for the services they render ({{harvnb|Hennessy|2003}}, {{harvnb|Kurtz|2013}}). {{As of|2016}}, in the United States, newly credentialed actuaries on average earn around $100,000 per year, while more experienced actuaries can earn over $150,000 per year {{harv|Ezra Penland|2016}}. Similarly, {{as of|2014|alt=a 2014}} survey in the United Kingdom indicated a starting salary for a newly credentialed actuary of about [[Pound sterling|£]]50,000; actuaries with more experience can earn well in excess of £100,000 {{harv|Crail|2014}}.

&lt;!-- Following all sourced to Riley --&gt;The actuarial profession has been consistently ranked for decades as one of the most desirable. Actuaries work comparatively reasonable hours, in comfortable conditions, without the need for physical exertion that may lead to injury, are well paid, and the profession consistently has a good hiring outlook {{harv|Riley|2013}}.&lt;!-- End sourcing to Riley --&gt; Not only has the overall profession ranked highly, but it also is considered one of the best professions for women {{harv|Shavin|2014}}, and one of the best recession-proof professions {{harv|Kiviat|2008}}. In the United States, the profession was rated as the best profession by CareerCast, which uses five key criteria to rank jobs—environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress, in 2010 {{harv|Needleman|2010}}, 2013 {{harv|Weber|2013}}, and 2015 {{harv|CareerCast|2015}}. In other years, it remained in the top 10 ({{harvnb|Thomas|2012}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2014}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2016}}). In the United Kingdom {{harv|Ugwumadu|2013}}, and around the world {{harv|ESSEC|2014}}, actuaries continue to be highly ranked as a profession.

==Credentialing and exams==
{{Main|Actuarial credentialing and exams}}
Becoming a fully credentialed actuary requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, usually taking several years. In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting {{harv|Norberg|1990|p=407}}. In others, such as the US, most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations ({{harvnb|SOA|2018}}, {{harvnb|CAS|2018}}). In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2011a}}.

===Exam support===
As these qualifying exams are extremely rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars designed for the exams {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011d}}. Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A common rule of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400&amp;nbsp;hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam {{harv|Sieger|1998}}. Thus, thousands of hours of study time should be anticipated over several years, assuming no failures {{harv|Feldblum|2001|p=6}}.

===Pass marks and pass rates===
Historically, the actuarial profession has been reluctant to specify the pass marks for its examinations ({{harvnb|Muckart|2010}}, {{harvnb|Prevosto|2000}}). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, "Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." {{harv|Muckart|2010}}. In 2000, the [[Casualty Actuarial Society]] (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers {{harv|Prevosto|2000}}. The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass."{{harv|CAS|2001}}.

==Notable actuaries==

==Fictional actuaries==
{{main|Fictional actuaries}}
Actuaries have appeared in works of fiction including literature, theater, television, and film. &lt;!-- Sourced to Coleman --&gt;At times, they have been portrayed as "math-obsessed, socially disconnected individuals with shockingly bad comb-overs", which has resulted in a mixed response amongst actuaries themselves {{harv|Coleman|2003}}.

 |quote=Early in the Empire, associations were formed for the purpose of meeting the funeral expenses of their members, whether the remains were to be buried or cremated, or for the purpose of building columbāria, or for both&amp;nbsp;... If the members had provided places for the disposal of their bodies after death, they now provided for the necessary funeral expenses by paying into the common fund weekly a small fixed sum, easily within the reach of the poorest of them. When a member died, a stated sum was drawn from the treasury for his funeral&amp;nbsp;... If the purpose of the society was the building of a columbārium, the cost was first determined and the sum total divided into what we should call shares (sortēs virīlēs), each member taking as many as he could afford and paying their value into the treasury.

== Fermat's method ==

Fermat used ''adequality'' first to find maxima of functions, and then adapted it to find tangent lines to curves.

To find the maximum of a term &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, Fermat equated (or more precisely adequated) &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(x+e)&lt;/math&gt; and after doing algebra he could cancel out a factor of &lt;math&gt;e,&lt;/math&gt; and then discard any remaining terms involving &lt;math&gt;e.&lt;/math&gt; To illustrate the method by Fermat's own example, consider the problem of finding the maximum of &lt;math&gt;p(x)=bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; (In Fermat's words, it is to divide a line &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, such that the product of the two parts &lt;math&gt;AE\times EC&lt;/math&gt; be a maximum.&lt;ref name="FermatTreatise" /&gt;) Fermat ''adequated'' &lt;math&gt;bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b(x+e)-(x+e)^2=bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2&lt;/math&gt;. That is (using the notation &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt; to denote adequality, introduced by [[Paul Tannery]]):
:&lt;math&gt;bx-x^2\backsim bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Canceling terms and dividing by &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; Fermat arrived at
:&lt;math&gt;b\backsim 2x+e.&lt;/math&gt;
Removing the terms that contained &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; Fermat arrived at the desired result that the maximum occurred when &lt;math&gt;x=b/2&lt;/math&gt;.

Fermat also used his principle to give a mathematical derivation of [[Snell's law]]s of refraction directly from the principle that light takes the quickest path.{{sfn|Grabiner|1983}}

==Descartes' criticism==
Fermat's method was highly criticized by his contemporaries, particularly [[Descartes]]. V. Katz suggests this is because Descartes had independently discovered the same new mathematics, known as his [[method of normals]], and Descartes was quite proud of his discovery. Katz also notes that while Fermat's methods were closer to the future developments in calculus, Descartes' methods had a more immediate impact on the development.{{sfn|Katz|2008}}

==Scholarly controversy==
{{cleanup|reason=too much unnecessary information displayed with poor formatting|date=September 2016}}
Both Newton and Leibniz referred to Fermat's work as an antecedent of [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Nevertheless, there is disagreement amongst modern scholars about the exact meaning of Fermat's adequality. Fermat's ''adequality'' was analyzed in a number of scholarly studies.  In 1896, [[Paul Tannery]] published a French translation of Fermat’s Latin treatises on maxima and minima (Fermat, Œuvres, Vol. III, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–156). Tannery translated Fermat's term as “adégaler” and adopted Fermat’s “adéquation”. Tannery also introduced the symbol &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt; for adequality in mathematical formulas.

'''Heinrich Wieleitner''' (1929)&lt;ref&gt;Wieleitner, H.:Bemerkungen zu Fermats Methode der Aufsuchung von Extremwerten und der Berechnung von Kurventangenten. Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung '''38''' (1929)24–35, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat replaces ''A'' with ''A''+''E''. Then he sets the new expression '''roughly equal''' ('''angenähert gleich''') to the old one, cancels  equal terms on both sides, and divides by the highest possible power of ''E''. He then cancels all terms which contain ''E'' and sets those that remain equal to each other. From that [the required] ''A'' results. That ''E'' should be as small as possible is nowhere said and is at best expressed by the word "adaequalitas". &lt;/blockquote&gt;(Wieleitner uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sim&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Max Miller''' (1934)&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.: Pierre de Fermats Abhandlungen über Maxima und Minima. Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, Leipzig (1934), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thereupon one should put the both terms, which express the maximum and the minimum, '''approximately equal''' ('''näherungsweise  gleich'''), as Diophantus says.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Miller uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Jean Itard''' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;Itard, I: Fermat précurseur du calcul différentiel. Arch Int. Hist. Sci. '''27''' (1948), 589–610, p.597&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;One knows that the expression "adégaler" is adopted by Fermat from Diophantus, translated by Xylander and by Bachet. It is about an '''approximate equality''' ('''égalité approximative''') ". &lt;/blockquote&gt;(Itard uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \backsim&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann''' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, J.E.: Über ein Extremwertproblem des Apollonius und seine Behandlung bei Fermat. Nova Acta Leopoldina (2) '''27''' (167) (1963), 105–113, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat chooses a quantity ''h'', thought as sufficiently small, and puts ''f''(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h'') '''roughly equal''' ('''ungefähr gleich''') to ''f''(''x''). His technical term is ''adaequare''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Hofmann uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Peer Strømholm''' (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Strømholm, P.: Fermat's method of maxima and minima and of tangents. A reconstruction. Arch. Hist Exact Sci. '''5''' (1968), 47–69, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The basis of Fermat's approach was the comparition of two expressions which, though they had the same form, were '''not exactly equal'''. This part of the process he called "''comparare par adaequalitatem''" or "''comparer per adaequalitatem''", and it implied that the otherwise strict identity between the two sides of the "equation" was destroyed by the modification of the variable by a ''small'' amount:

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(A){\sim}f(A+E)&lt;/math&gt;.

This, I believe, was the real significance of his use of Diophantos' πἀρισον, stressing the ''smallness'' of the variation. The ordinary translation of 'adaequalitas' seems to be "'''approximate equality'''", but I much prefer "'''pseudo-equality'''" to present Fermat's thought at this point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He further notes that "there was never in M1 (Method 1) any question of the variation ''E'' being put equal to zero. The words Fermat used to express the process of suppressing terms containing ''E'' was 'elido', 'deleo', and 'expungo', and in French 'i'efface' and 'i'ôte'. We can hardly believe that a sane man wishing to express his meaning and searching for words, would constantly hit upon such tortuous ways of imparting the simple fact that the terms vanished because ''E'' was zero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Claus Jensen''' (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, C.: ''Pierre Fermat's method of determining tangents and its application to the conchoid and the quadratrix.'' Centaurus '''14''' (1969), 72–85, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, in applying the notion of ''adégalité'' – which constitutes the basis of Fermat's general method of constructing tangents, and by which is meant a comparition of two magnitudes '''as if they were equal, although they are in fact not''' ("tamquam essent aequalia, licet revera aequalia non sint") – I will employ the nowadays more usual symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Latin quotation comes from Tannery's 1891 edition of Fermat, volume 1, page 140.
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[Michael Sean Mahoney]]''' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, M.S.: ''Fermat, Pierre de.'' Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. IV, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York (1971), p.569.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat's Method of maxima and minima, which is clearly applicable to any polynomial 'P(x)'', originally rested on purely ''finitistic'' algebraic foundations. It assumed, '''counterfactually''', the inequality of two equal roots in order to determine, by Viete's theory of equations, a relation between those roots and one of the coefficients of the polynomial, a relation that was fully general. This relation then led to an extreme-value solution when Fermat removed his '''counterfactual assumption''' and set the roots equal. Borrowing a term from Diophantus, Fermat called this '''counterfactual equality''' 'adequality'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Mahoney uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt;.) On p.&amp;nbsp;164, end of footnote 46, Mahoney notes that one of the meanings of adequality is ''approximate equality'' or ''equality in the limiting case''.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Charles Henry Edwards, Jr. ''' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C.H., Jr.:''The historical Development of the Calculus.'' Springer, New York 1979, p.122f&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, in order to determine how to subdivide a segment of length &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b&lt;/math&gt; into two segments &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b-x&lt;/math&gt; whose product &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(b-x)=bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; is maximal, that is to find the rectangle with perimeter &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2b&lt;/math&gt; that has the maximal area, he [Fermat] proceeds  as follows. First he substituted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x+e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; (he used ''A'', ''E'' instead of ''x'', ''e'') for the unknown ''x'', and then wrote down the following '''"pseudo-equality"''' to compare the resulting expression with the original one:

:&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle b(x+e)-(x+e)^2=bx+be-x^2-2xe-e^2\; \sim\; bx-x^2. &lt;/math&gt;

After canceling terms, he divided through by ''e'' to obtain &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b-2\,x-e\;\sim\;0.&lt;/math&gt; Finally he discarded the remaining term containing ''e'', transforming the '''pseudo-equality''' into the true equality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x=\frac{b}{2}&lt;/math&gt; that gives the value of ''x'' which makes &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; maximal. Unfortunately, Fermat never explained the logical basis for this method with sufficient clarity or completeness to prevent disagreements between historical scholars as to precisely what he meant or intended."

'''[[Kirsti Andersen]]''' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, K.: ''Techniques of the calculus 1630–1660.'' In: Grattan-Guinness, I. (ed): ''From the Calculus to Set Theory. An Introductory History.'' Duckworth, London 1980, 10–48, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The two expressions of the maximum or minimum are made ''"adequal"'', which means something like '''as nearly equal as possible'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Andersen uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Herbert Breger''' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Breger, H.: ''The mysteries of adaequare: A vindication of Fermat.'' Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. '''46''' (1994), 193–219&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to put forward my hypothesis: ''Fermat used the word "adaequare" in the sense of'' '''"to put equal"''' ... In a mathematical context, the only difference between "aequare" and "adaequare" seems to be that the latter gives more stress on the fact that the equality is achieved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Page 197f.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[John Stillwell]]''' (Stillwell 2006 p. 91) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat introduced the idea of adequality in 1630s but he was ahead of his time. His successors were unwilling to give up the convenience of ordinary equations, preferring to use equality loosely rather than to use adequality accurately. The idea of adequality was revived only in the twentieth century, in the so-called [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[Enrico Giusti]]''' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Giusti, Enrico, Les méthodes des maxima et minima de Fermat. Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math. (6) 18 (2009), Fascicule Spécial, 59–85.&lt;/ref&gt; cites Fermat's letter to [[Marin Mersenne]] where Fermat wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Cette comparaison par adégalité produit deux termes inégaux qui enfin produisent l'égalité (selon ma méthode) qui nous donne la solution de la question"  ("This comparison by adequality produces two unequal terms which finally produce the equality (following my method) which gives us the solution of the problem")..&lt;/blockquote&gt; Giusti notes in a footnote that this letter seems to have escaped Breger's notice.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Klaus Barner''' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Barner, K.: ''Fermat’s  &lt;&lt;adaequare&gt;&gt; – and no end in sight? (Fermats  &lt;&lt;adaequare&gt;&gt; – und kein Ende? '') Math. Semesterber. (2011) '''58''', pp. 13–45&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that Fermat uses two different Latin words (aequabitur and adaequabitur) to replace the nowadays usual equals sign, ''aequabitur'' when the equation concerns a valid identity between two constants, a universally valid (proved) formula, or a conditional equation, ''adaequabitur'', however, when the equation describes a relation between two variables, which are ''not independent'' (and the equation is no valid formula). On page 36, Barner writes: "Why did Fermat continually repeat his inconsistent procedure for all his examples for the method of tangents? Why did he never mention the secant, with which he in fact operated? I do not know."

They develop a formalisation of Fermat's technique of adequality in modern mathematics as the [[standard part function]] which rounds off a finite [[hyperreal number]] to its nearest [[real number]].

'''''Algebraic Geometry''''' is an influential,&lt;ref&gt;[[MathSciNet]] lists more than 2500 citations of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; [[algebraic geometry]] [[textbook]] written by [[Robin Hartshorne]] and published by [[Springer-Verlag]] in 1977.

==Importance==
It was the first extended treatment of [[scheme theory]] written as a text intended to be accessible to graduate students.

==Contents==
The first chapter, titled "Varieties", deals with the classical algebraic geometry of [[algebraic variety|varieties]] over algebraically closed fields. This chapter uses many classical results in [[commutative algebra]], including [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], with the books by Atiyah&amp;ndash;Macdonald, Matsumura, and Zariski&amp;ndash;Samuel as usual references. The second and the third chapters, "Schemes" and "Cohomology", form the technical heart of the book. The last two chapters, "Curves" and "Surfaces", respectively explore the geometry of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional objects, using the tools developed in the Chapters 2 and 3.

[[Incunabula]] are extremely rare and valuable, but as the "[[scientific revolution]]" is only taken to have started around the 1540s, such works of [[Renaissance literature]] (including [[alchemy]], [[Renaissance magic]], etc.) are not usually included under the notion of "scientific" literature. Printed originals of the beginning scientific revolution thus date to the 1540s or later, notably beginning with the original publication of [[Copernican heliocentrism]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'  ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' of 1543 sold for more than US$2 million at auctions.&lt;ref&gt;US$2,210,500 at a [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/copernicus-nicolaus-de-revolutionibus-orbium-coelestium-5084091-details.aspx Christies] auction in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arcadia''''' is a 1993 play by [[Tom Stoppard]] concerning the relationship between past and present, order and disorder, certainty and uncertainty. It has been praised by many critics as the finest play from one of the most significant contemporary playwrights in the English language.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=1}}  In 2006, the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]] named it one of the [[Best science book ever|best science-related works]] ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Randerson, James (2006) "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/oct/21/uk.books Levi's memoir beats Darwin to win science book title]," ''The Guardian'', 20 October 2006, accessed 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Arcadia'' is set in Sidley Park, an [[English country house]] in [[Derbyshire]], and takes place in both 1809/1812 and the present day (1993 in the original production). The activities of two modern scholars and the house's current residents are juxtaposed with those of the people who lived there in the earlier period.

In 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her [[tutor]] Septimus Hodge, a friend of [[Lord Byron]] (an unseen guest in the house). In the present, writer Hannah Jarvis and literature professor Bernard Nightingale converge on the house: she is investigating a [[Garden hermit|hermit who once lived on the grounds]]; he is researching a mysterious chapter in the life of Byron. As their studies unfold – with the help of Valentine Coverly, a post-graduate student in [[mathematical biology]] – the truth about what happened in Thomasina's time is gradually revealed.

The play's set features a large table, used by the characters in both past and present. Props are not removed when the play switches time period; books, [[coffee mug]]s, [[quill pen]]s, portfolios, and laptop computers appear together, blurring past and present.  An ancient but still living [[tortoise]] also appears in every scene, symbolising long-suffering endurance and the continuity of existence.

===Scene 1 (Act 1)===
The play opens on 10 April 1809, in a garden-front room of the house. Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about "[[carnal desire|carnal embrace]]" by challenging her to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]; he also wants to focus on reading the poem "The Couch of Eros" by Ezra Chater, a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in [[rice pudding]] can never be unstirred, which leads her on to the topic of [[determinism]] and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned "carnal embrace" with Septimus; he has come to demand a [[duel]]. Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on "The Couch of Eros". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who savaged an earlier work of his, "The Maid of Turkey". Then [[landscape architect]] Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.

===Scene 2===
The setting shifts to the present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals his identity from Hannah, as he had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the [[population biology]] of the [[grouse]] in the surrounding grounds, using the house's "game books". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material, which enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed in a duel by Lord Byron. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a [[botanist]].

===Scene 3===
The third scene returns to the earlier time frame; Septimus is again tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating [[Latin]]. Again their focus diverts, this time to [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|the destruction of the Alexandrian Library]], which upsets Thomasina.  She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are again interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to the duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review.

===Scene 4===
Hannah rediscovers Thomasina's [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] containing her ideas on [[iteration]] and [[chaos theory]]; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.

===Scene 5 (Act 2)===
Still in the present, Bernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park – who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the [[heat death of the universe]], the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram – could have been Septimus.

===Scene 6===
Returning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chaters left for the [[West Indies]] with Captain Brice, Mr. Chater serving as the expedition's botanist and Mrs. Chater as the captain's secret [[paramour]]. Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone [[rabbiting|rabbit hunting]] for Thomasina, who favours [[rabbit pie]]; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters Septimus wrote in case he should die in the duel: one to Thomasina, is about rice pudding, and the other is a love letter addressed to herself. Lady Croom invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.

===Scene 7===
The final scene takes place in both 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in [[fancy dress]] for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. Chloe reads a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory and then talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force disrupting the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the concept of [[entropy]]; he wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.

Meanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, for her forthcoming birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his [[steam engine]]; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]]), which describe the [[universe]] as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death – this discovery totally discredits his theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the [[Irreversible process|irreversibility of heat]]; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who also pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.

Eventually a [[waltz]] starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, their relationship increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was actually Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit; accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton]], he worked for the rest of his life to apply "honest English algebra" to the question of the universe's future.

* Septimus Hodge: Thomasina's tutor, and the academic colleague and friend of Lord Byron (an unseen but important character). While teaching Thomasina, he works on his own research and has affairs with the older women of the house. When Thomasina is older, he falls in love with her; after her death, he becomes the "hermit of Sidley Park", working on her theories until his own death.
* Jellaby: The Crooms' butler. His chief functions are to spread gossip and to deliver letters.
* Ezra Chater: An unsuccessful [[poetaster]] staying at Sidley Park. His wife's romantic affairs lead him to challenge Septimus to a duel. Later, it is revealed that he is the amateur botanist "Mr. Chater," who dies of a monkey bite in [[Martinique]], where he has travelled with his wife and Captain Brice.
* Charity Chater: Ezra Chater's wife. Though she, like Byron, never appears onstage, she plays a vital role. She sleeps with Septimus, and her repeatedly cuckolded husband challenges him to a duel. She sleeps with Lord Byron and gets him, her husband, Captain Brice, and herself kicked out of Sidley Park.
* Richard Noakes: Lady Croom's gardener. Throughout the play, he is working to transform Sidley Park's classical, Arcadia-like landscape into the popular Gothic style – which Lady Croom begrudgingly accepts. He is key in exposing Septimus' and Mrs. Chater's affair.
* Lady Croom: Thomasina's mother.  She rules the Coverly estate with an iron fist, but flirts with Septimus and other gentlemen throughout the play. A second Lady Croom, the mother of Valentine, Chloe and Gus in the modern half of the play, never appears on stage.
* Captain Brice: The brother of Lady Croom (of 1809). He is a sea captain who falls in love with Mrs. Chater. He takes her and her husband to the West Indies at the end of the play. After Mr. Chater's death, Captain Brice marries Mrs. Chater.
* Augustus Coverly: Thomasina's trouble-making younger brother.  He appears in only a few brief scenes. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)

===Characters of the present===
* Hannah Jarvis: The author of a best-seller on Byron's mistress Lady Caroline Lamb. Hannah is researching the elusive [[hermit]] of Sidley Park, who lived there in the early 19th century. Hannah collaborates (warily) with Bernard and also with Valentine, though she rejects the romantic advances of both.
* Chloe Coverly: The 18-year-old daughter of the modern Lady Croom. While her mind is not as rigorous as Thomasina's, Chloe likes to propose wild ideas. She argues that the Newtonian universe has been destabilized by sex and the problems it causes. She tries to set up Hannah with Bernard, but ends up sleeping with him herself.
* Bernard Nightingale: A don at a modern university in Sussex, England. Bernard comes to Sidley Park hoping to work with Hannah on his theory about Lord Byron staying at the estate. Foolishly, instead of seeking further evidence, he announces on TV his theory that Lord Byron killed Ezra Chater in a duel. At the end of the play, Hannah proves him wrong, much to his chagrin.
* Valentine Coverly: Chloe's older brother. A graduate student of mathematics, he pores over several old documents and comes to acknowledge Thomasina's genius.
* Gus Coverly: Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been mute since the age of five. Gus helps to pass several important props from past to present, and helps connect key moments in the play. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)

==Genre==
''Arcadia'' is, on the surface, somewhere between a [[tragedy]] and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy — "[[Integrity|noble]]" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death — but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, [[epigram]]matic dialogue.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=45}}

==Themes==
''Arcadia'' explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics and [[physics]]. It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading [[James Gleick]]'s 1987 bestseller, ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', "which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Delaney |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Tom Stoppard in Conversation |url= |location= |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=224 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broderson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Chaos in Arcadia|url=http://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/education_department/words_on_plays/Arcadia%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2013).pdf|website=American Conservatory Theater|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including [[thermodynamics]], computer [[algorithms]], [[fractals]], [[population dynamics]], [[determinism]] (especially in the context of love and death), [[classics]], [[landscape design]], [[Romanticism]] vs. [[Classicism]], [[English literature]] (particularly poetry), [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], 18th century [[periodical]]s, modern [[academia]], and even South Pacific [[botany]]. These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into [[epistemology]], [[nihilism]], and the origins of [[lust]] and [[Insanity|madness]].

''Arcadia'''s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order – and even the separation of the two eras – dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: "In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing." Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic – with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions — connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.

The center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at [[Bath Spa University]], explains: "At the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' — which therefore cannot really be disorder at all."&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

A closely related theme in ''Arcadia'' is the opposition of [[Classicism]] and [[Romanticism]]. This appears most clearly in the running argument between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. They all involve moving from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it.  Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. "The whole Romantic sham!" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. "It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling."

Another major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian equations]] work both backwards and forwards, things in reality – like her rice pudding – cannot be "unstirred." Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters – and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.

Thomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem ''[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]'' by her "real life" contemporary, Lord Byron.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Written in 1816 — the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] erupting in the [[Dutch East Indies]] — "Darkness" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.

The play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict — Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling — they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.

==Style==
Jim Hunter writes that ''Arcadia'' is a relatively [[Realism (theatre)|realistic]] play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is "much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Jim|title=Tom Stoppard|publisher=Faber|location=London|year=2000|series=Faber Critical Guides|page=155|chapter=Arcadia|isbn=0-571-19782-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehensible]]: the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion.  ''Arcadia'''s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two  plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature;{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=49}} we later see Val, with his computer, [[Graph of a function|plotting]] them to produce the image of a leaf.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=62}}

==Language==
The language of ''Arcadia'' switches between the [[colloquialism]]s of early 19th century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.

But his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the "look and feel" of the past as perceived by the modern audience.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=95}} Still, it has sufficient latitude in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of "carnal embrace"{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=4}} – but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he repudiates Chater's defence of his wife's honour (which he says "could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry").{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=9}}  With Lady Croom, who sees Mrs. Chater as a "harlot", Septimus delicately admits that "her passion is not as fixed" as one might wish.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=95}}

In the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=45}} But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric;{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=70}} and he unleashes a "performance art" polemic against Valentine's scientific thought, not from spite but for "recreation".{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|pp=80–82}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=64}}

The play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to [[entropy]], the [[deterministic universe]] and [[Iteration|iterated equations]] in improvised, colloquial terms.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Paul|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tom Stoppard|editor=Kelly, Katherine E |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|pages=178–183|isbn=0-521-64592-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|pp=56–63}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=48–51}}

Consciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if "the future is all programmed like a computer", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited "because of sex".{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=97}} Thomasina has been there before: "If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future," she tells Septimus, then adds, "Am I the first person to have thought of this?"{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=66}} The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of [[Chaos theory|chaos]], illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=65–66}}

==Title==
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|The title ''Arcadia'' alludes to a pastoral ideal.]]
[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' is most known as the title of this painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], also known as ''Les bergers d'Arcadie'' ("The Arcadian Shepherds")]]
The play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}  ''Arcadia'' refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, "and in Arcadia I am".  The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's ''Eclogues'', while the phrase first appears in [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] 1637 painting. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a ''[[memento mori]]'', with the phrase being spoken by Death: "I, too, am in Arcadia". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cohen | first=J.M. | authorlink=J. M. Cohen |author2=Cohen, M.J. | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Quotations | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1960 | location=Harmondsworth, England | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | authorlink=Erwin Panofsky | others=quoted in Knowles, Elizabeth (Ed.) | title=The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations:Arcadia | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as "Here I am in Arcadia!" Thomasina drily comments, "Yes Mama, if you would have it so". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation "Even in Arcadia, there am I". He is right – "Oh, phooey to Death!" she exclaims.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=13}} Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}} Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using ''Et in Arcadia Ego'' for the title, but "box office sense prevailed".{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}

In a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which "true nature" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and [[entropy|entropic decline]] using mathematics.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}

==Contextual information==
In ''Arcadia'', Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.

One of the play's main thematic concepts is [[chaos theory]]. Paul Edwards, in his essay "Science in ''Hapgood'' and ''Arcadia''", notes that "chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of [[classical physics]]), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy".{{cn|date=April 2015}}{{rp|181}}

John Fleming, in his book ''Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos'', makes a similar observation. "Deterministic chaos", he writes, "deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected [[dynamic system]]s to settle into stable, predictable behavior."  But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. "Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos — an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior."{{sfn|Fleming|2001|pp=193–194}}

Closely related scientific and mathematical concepts in ''Arcadia'' are the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and [[entropy]]. Fleming describes these two principles. "Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike [[Newton's laws of motion]], do not go backward and forward, there is an '[[arrow of time]]' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe."{{sfn|Fleming|2001|p=194}}

In ''Arcadia'', Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that "there is an underlying order to seemingly random events." The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them.

Some ideas in the play recall [[Goethe]]'s novella ''[[Elective Affinities]]'': Stoppard's characters "Thomasina" and "Septimus" have parallels in Goethe's "Ottilie" and "Eduard", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella.{{sfn|Wilson|2003|pp=59–66}}  Among other parallels, the older work takes the [[Chemical affinity#Early theories|theory of affinity between chemical elements]] as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable "human chemistry" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demastes|first1=William W|title=The Cambridge introduction to Tom Stoppard|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9781107021952|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd-Barr|first1=Kirsten E.|title=Theatre and Evolution from Ibsen to Beckett|date=3 Mar 2015|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn= 9780231164702|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character "Ottilie" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this.{{sfn|Wilson|2003|pp=59–66}}

==Productions==
[[File:ArcadiaPoster.jpg|right|thumb|135px|Poster, by [[James McMullan]], for the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] 1995 production]]''Arcadia'' first opened at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] with [[Rufus Sewell]] as Septimus Hodge, [[Felicity Kendal]] as Hannah Jarvis, [[Bill Nighy]] as Bernard Nightingale, [[Emma Fielding]] as Thomasina Coverly, Alan Mitchell as Jellaby, Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingston as Richard Noakes, [[Harriet Walter]] as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, [[Tim Matthews (actor)|Timothy Matthews]] as Augustus  and Gus Coverly and [[Samuel West]] as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 [[Olivier Award|Olivier]] and [[Evening Standard Award]]s for Best Play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Evening%20Standard%20Awards&amp;Year=1993 Evening Standard Award] Retrieved on 8 October 2009  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504091559/http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Evening+Standard+Awards&amp;Year=1993 |date= 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first New York production opened in March 1995, at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]].&lt;ref name="canbynyt" /&gt; It was again directed by [[Trevor Nunn]], but with an entirely new cast. It starred [[Billy Crudup]] as Septimus, [[Blair Brown]] as Hannah, [[Victor Garber]] as Bernard, [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Valentine and [[Jennifer Dundas]] as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of [[Paul Giamatti]], who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were [[Lisa Banes]] (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and [[Haviland Morris]] (Chloe). This production won the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award, and was nominated for the 1995 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play, losing to [[Terrence McNally]]'s ''[[Love! Valour! Compassion!]]''.

In December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/theater/reviews/arcadia.htm|title=Stoppard's Coolly Clever ‘Arcadia’|last=Rose|first=Lloyd|authorlink=Lloyd Rose|date=20 December 1996|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by [[David Leveaux]], opened at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] starring [[Dan Stevens]] (Septimus Hodge),  [[Samantha Bond]] (Hannah Jarvis), [[Jessie Cave]] (Thomasina Coverly), [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] (Lady Croom), [[Trevor Cooper]] (Richard Noakes), [[Sam Cox (actor)|Sam Cox]] (Jellaby), [[Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1986)|Lucy Griffiths]] (Chloë Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), [[Hugh Mitchell (actor)|Hugh Mitchell]] (Augustus/Gus Coverly), [[Neil Pearson]] (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and [[Ed Stoppard]] (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;It was produced by [[Sonia Friedman]].[http://broadwayworld.com/article/ARCADIA_Recoups_Production_Costs_Finishes_Run_Sept_12_20090806  ''Arcadia'' Recoups Production Costs, Finishes Run Sept 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arcadia'' returned to Broadway, at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included [[Margaret Colin]] (Lady Croom), [[Billy Crudup]] (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), [[Raúl Esparza]] (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), [[Grace Gummer]] (Chloë Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), [[Bel Powley]] (Thomasina Coverly), [[Tom Riley (actor)|Tom Riley]] (Septimus Hodge), [[Noah Robbins]] (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and [[Lia Williams]] (Hannah Jarvis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Crudup_Esparza_Williams_More_to_Star_in_ARCADIA_Begins_at_Barrymore_Theatre_on_Feb_25_20101229_page2|title=Crudup, Esparza, Williams &amp; More to Star in ARCADIA; Begins at Barrymore Theatre on 25 Feb.|date=29 December 2010|work=Broadwayworld.com|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150437-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations |title=2011 Tony Nominations Announced; Book of Mormon Earns 14 Nominations |date=3 May 2011 |work=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914233343/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150437-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Times]]'', reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a "perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nightingale|first=Benedict|authorlink=Benedict Nightingale|date=14 April 1993|title=Ideas meet their comic match|journal=The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: "[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters," noted ''[[The Daily Mail]]''. "One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tinker|first=Jack|authorlink=|date=14 April 1993|title=Another lesson in whims and conceit at the knee of too-clever Mr Stoppard|journal=The Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' critic commented: "I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Spencer (journalist)|date=26 May 1994|title=Stoppard's thrilling workout|journal=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the play as "Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion".&lt;ref name="canbynyt"&gt;{{cite news | first=Vincent | last=Canby | authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Theatre Review: Arcadia; Stoppard's Comedy Of 1809 and Now | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/theater/theater-review-arcadia-stoppard-s-comedy-of-1809-and-now.html?scp=1 | work=The New York Times | date=31 March 1995 | accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=82}} The production left [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' with the view that "Stoppard overdoes it…''Arcadia'' makes better reading than seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=John|title=Wits' End|journal=New York Magazine|date=10 April 1995|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as "Stoppard's finest work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=198&amp;story=E8831244481126&amp;title=Review%20Round-up:%20Critics%20Hail%20Stoppard%27s%20Arcadia|title=Critics Hail Stoppard's ''Arcadia''|last=Bosanquet|first=Theo|work=Review Round-up|publisher=Whatsonstage.com|quote=confirms the status of the play as Stoppard's "finest work".|accessdate=1 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810010709/http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=198|archive-date=10 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the play "gets richer with each viewing. ...

The 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the production "a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific ''Arcadia''", noting that "several central roles are slightly miscast", and "some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/theater/reviews/arcadia-by-tom-stoppard-on-broadway-review.html?ref=arts&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Theater Review; The 180-Year Itch, Metaphysically Speaking|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=18 March 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by critics from the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', ''[[Time Out New York]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Broadway_Review_Roundup_ARCADIA_20110317|title=Broadway Review Roundup: ARCADIA|date=18 March 2011|work=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ars Magna''''' ("The Great Art") is an important [[Latin]]-language book on [[algebra]] written by [[Girolamo Cardano]]. It was first published in 1545 under the title ''Artis Magnæ, Sive de Regulis Algebraicis Liber Unus'' (''Book number one about The Great Art, or The Rules of Algebra''). There was a second edition in Cardano's lifetime, published in 1570. It is considered&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the foreword that [[Oystein Ore]] wrote for the English translation of the book, mentioned at the bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the three greatest scientific treatises of the early [[Renaissance]], together with [[Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' and [[Vesalius]]' ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]''. The first editions of these three books were published within a two-year span (1543–1545).

==History==
In 1535 [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] became famous for having solved cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0). However, he chose to keep his method secret. In 1539, Cardano, then a lecturer in mathematics at the Piatti Foundation in Milan, published his first mathematical book, ''Pratica Arithmeticæ et mensurandi singularis'' (''The Practice of Arithmetic and Simple Mensuration''). That same year, he asked Tartaglia to explain to him his method for solving [[cubic equations]]. After some reluctance, Tartaglia did so, but he asked Cardano not to share the information until he published it. Cardano submerged himself in mathematics during the next several years working on how to extend Tartaglia's formula to other types of cubics. Furthermore, his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] found a way of solving quartic equations, but Ferrari's method depended upon Tartaglia's, since it involved the use of an auxiliary cubic equation. Then Cardano became aware of the fact that [[Scipione del Ferro]] had discovered Tartaglia's formula before Tartaglia himself, a discovery that prompted him to publish these results.

==Contents==
The book, which is divided into forty chapters, contains the first published algebraic solution to [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s. Cardano acknowledges that Tartaglia gave him the formula for solving a type of cubic equations and that the same formula had been discovered by Scipione del Ferro. He also acknowledges that it was Ferrari who found a way of solving quartic equations.

Since at the time negative numbers were not generally acknowledged, knowing how to solve cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' did not mean knowing how to solve cubics of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' (with ''a'',''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0), for instance. Besides, Cardano, also explains how to reduce equations of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 to cubic equations without a quadratic term, but, again, he has to consider several cases. In all, Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations (chapters XI–XXIII).

In ''Ars Magna'' the concept of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]] appears for the first time (chapter I). The first example that Cardano provides of a polynomial equation with multiple roots is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;16, of which &amp;minus;2 is a double root.

''Ars Magna'' also contains the first occurrence of [[complex number]]s (chapter&amp;nbsp;XXXVII). The problem mentioned by Cardano which leads to square roots of negative numbers is: find two numbers whose sum is equal to 10 and whose product is equal to 40. The answer is 5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/span&gt; and 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/span&gt;. Cardano called this "sophistic," because he saw no physical meaning to it, but boldly wrote "nevertheless we will operate" and formally calculated that their product does indeed equal 40. Cardano then says that this answer is &amp;ldquo;as subtle as it is useless&amp;rdquo;.

It is a common misconception that Cardano introduced complex numbers in solving cubic equations. Since (in modern notation) Cardano's formula for a root of the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''px''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp; is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{-\frac q2+\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27}}}+\sqrt[3]{-\frac q2-\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27}}},&lt;/math&gt;
square roots of negative numbers appear naturally in this context. However, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27 never happens to be negative in the specific cases in which Cardano applies the formula.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean that no cubic equation occurs in ''Ars Magna'' for which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0. For instance, chapter&amp;nbsp;I contains the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12''x'', for which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;175/4. However, Cardano never applies his formula in those cases.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains special characters}}

A '''bracket''' is a tall [[punctuation]] mark commonly used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. The matched pair is best described as ''opening'' and ''closing''.&lt;ref&gt;''UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm'', {{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Paired_Brackets |title=3.1.3 Paired Brackets |access-date=24 April 2018 |website=unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally, in a left-to-right context, it may be described as ''left'' and ''right'', and in a right-to-left context, as ''right'' and ''left''.

Forms include round (also called "parentheses"), square, curly (also called "braces"), and angle brackets (also called "chevrons"), as well as various other pairs of symbols.

In addition to referring to the class of all types of brackets, the unqualified word ''bracket'' is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket: in modern American usage, this is usually the square bracket and in modern British usage, this is usually the round bracket.

== History ==

Chevrons (⟨&amp;nbsp;⟩) were the earliest type of bracket to appear in [[written English]]. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] coined the term ''lunula'' to refer to the rounded parentheses (), recalling the shape of the crescent [[moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Truss, Lynne. ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves'', 2003. p. 161. {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names for various bracket symbols==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
Some of the following names are regional or contextual.

* (&amp;nbsp;) &amp;ndash; parentheses, brackets (UK, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia), parens, round brackets, first brackets, or circle brackets
* {&amp;nbsp;} &amp;ndash; braces are "two connecting marks used in printing"; and in music "to connect staves to be performed at the same time"&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10th Edition, [[Oxford University Press]], Great Clarendon Street, Oxford OX2 2DP, UK&lt;/ref&gt; (UK and US), French brackets, curly brackets, definite brackets, swirly brackets, curly braces, birdie brackets, Scottish brackets, squirrelly brackets, gullwings, seagulls, squiggly brackets, twirly brackets, Tuborg brackets (DK), accolades (NL), pointy brackets, second brackets, fancy brackets, M Brace, moustache brackets.
* [&amp;nbsp;] &amp;ndash; square brackets, closed brackets, hard brackets, third brackets, crotchets,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John. ''The Printer’s Grammar'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; or brackets (US)
* ⟨&amp;nbsp;⟩ &amp;ndash; pointy brackets, angle brackets, triangular brackets, diamond brackets, tuples, or chevrons
* &amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; &amp;ndash; inequality signs, pointy brackets, or brackets. Sometimes referred to as angle brackets, in such cases as [[HTML]] markup. Occasionally known as broken brackets or "brokets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/B/broket.html |title=broket |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ⸤ ⸥; ｢ ｣ &amp;ndash; corner brackets
* ⟦&amp;nbsp;⟧ &amp;ndash; double square brackets, white square brackets
* 〔&amp;nbsp;〕 &amp;ndash; tortoise shell brackets
* {{lang|fr|Guillemets}}, ‹&amp;nbsp;› and «&amp;nbsp;», are sometimes referred to as chevrons or [double] angle brackets, but are not used as brackets.&lt;ref name=msterm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/language/en-us/Search.aspx?sString=chevron&amp;langID=de-de |title=Terminology Search - Microsoft |website=Microsoft Language Portal - Terminology Collection|date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==

The characters ‹&amp;nbsp;› and «&amp;nbsp;», known as {{lang|fr|[[guillemet]]}}s or angular quote brackets, are actually [[quotation mark]] [[glyph]]s used in several European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors|year=1998|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C6V9zRxSPkC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;|isbn=0-87779-622-X}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Which one of each pair is the opening quote mark and which is the closing quote varies between languages.

Similarly, the corner-brackets ｢&amp;nbsp;｣ are quotation marks used in East Asian languages (see [[Quotation mark#Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks|Quotation mark § Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks]]).

In English, typographers mostly  prefer to not set brackets in [[italics]], even when the enclosed text is italic.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst, ''The Elements of Typographic Style'', §5.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually set in italics too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsmann |first1=Friedrich |last2=DeJong |first2=Ralf |date=2004 |title=Detailtypografie |trans-title=Detail Typography |language=German |location=Mainz |publisher= Herrmann Schmidt |page=263 |isbn= 978-3874396424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage in writing====
Parentheses {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|θ|ᵻ|s|iː|z}} (singular, parenthesis {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|θ|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}) (also called simply brackets, or round brackets, curves, curved brackets, oval brackets, stalls or, colloquially, parens {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|z}}) contain material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]) or is aside from the main point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Straus|first=Jane|author-link=Jane Straus|title=Parentheses&amp;nbsp;— Punctuation Rules|url=http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/parens.asp|work=The Blue Book of Grammar and Punctuation|publisher=grammarbook.com|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas as the [[delimiter]], though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result.

In American usage, parentheses are usually considered separate from other brackets, and calling them "brackets" is unusual.

Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as "Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) spoke at length". They can also indicate shorthand for "[[uncertain plural|either singular or plural]]" for nouns, e.g. "the claim(s)". It can also be used for [[gender neutral language]], especially in languages with [[grammatical gender]], e.g. "(s)he agreed with his (her) physician".&lt;ref&gt;[[Slash (punctuation)#Gender-neutrality in Spanish and Portuguese]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author [[William Faulkner]] (see ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' and [[The Sound and the Fury#Part 2: June 2, 1910|the Quentin section of ''The Sound and the Fury'']]) as well as poet [[E. E. Cummings]].

Parentheses have historically been used where the [[Em dash|dash]] is currently used in alternatives, such as "parenthesis)(parentheses". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|Fowler's]]''.

Parentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fogarty|first=Mignon|title=Parentheses, Brackets, and Braces|url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/parentheses-brackets-and-braces.aspx|publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fix|text=not a reliable source}}

Any punctuation inside parentheses or other brackets is independent of the rest of the text: "Mrs. Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady." In this usage, the explanatory text in the parentheses is a [[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]. (Parenthesized text is usually short and within a single sentence. Where several sentences of supplemental material are used in parentheses the final [[full stop]] would be within the parentheses, or simply omitted. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the text is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed.)

In more formal usage, "[[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]" may refer to the entire bracketed text, not just to the punctuation marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be said to be "a [[parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthesis]]", "a parenthetical", or "a parenthetical phrase").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/parenthetical |title=The Free Online Dictionary |publisher=[[Thefreedictionary.com]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage in enumerations====
===== Unpaired parenthesis =====
Lower-case [[Latin letters]] used as indexes, rather than [[bullet (typography)|bullet]]s or numbers, followed by an unpaired parenthesis, are used in ordered [[wiktionary:list|list]]s especially in:
#[[education]]al testing,
#technical writing and diagrams,
#[[market research]], and
#[[elections]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====Usage as antisemitic symbol====
Since 2014, [[antisemite]]s have used [[triple parentheses]] around the names of people to denote them as Jewish.&lt;ref name=mic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleishman|first1=Cooper|last2=Smith|first2=Anthony|title=(((Echoes))), Exposed: The Secret Symbol Neo-Nazis Use to Target Jews Online|url=https://mic.com/articles/144228/echoes-exposed-the-secret-symbol-neo-nazis-use-to-target-jews-online|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=Mic|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage in mathematics====
Parentheses are used in [[mathematical notation]] to indicate grouping, often inducing a different [[order of operations]]. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, {{math|2 + 3 × 4}} equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, {{math|(2 + 3) × 4}} equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example:

:&lt;math&gt;[(2 + 3) \times 4]^2 = 400.&lt;/math&gt;

A related convention is that when parentheses have two levels of nesting, curly brackets (braces) are the outermost pair. Following this convention, when more than three levels of nesting are needed, often a cycle of parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets will continue. This helps to distinguish between one such level and the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.about.com/od/mathhelpandtutorials/fl/Parenthesis-Braces-and-Brackets.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806203819/http://math.about.com/od/mathhelpandtutorials/fl/Parenthesis-Braces-and-Brackets.html |archivedate=6 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parentheses are also used to set apart the [[Parameter|argument]]s in mathematical [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s. For example, {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the function ''{{math|f}}'' applied to the [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] ''{{math|x}}''. In [[coordinate system]]s parentheses are used to denote a set of coordinates; so in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] {{math|(4, 7)}} may represent the point located at 4 on the ''x''-axis and 7 on the ''y''-axis. 

Parentheses may also be used to represent a [[binomial coefficient]].

====Usage in programming languages====
Parentheses are included in the syntaxes of many [[programming languages]]. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the Method/Function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in [[LISP]], parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language.

====Usage in other scientific fields====
Parentheses are used in [[chemistry]] to denote a [[polyatomic ion]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} They can be used in various fields as notation to indicate the amount of [[uncertainty]]. For example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html
 | title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty
 | work=[[CODATA]] reference | publisher=[[NIST]] | accessdate=2018-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 1234.56789(11)
is equivalent to:
: {{nowrap|1234.56789 ± 0.00011}}

==== Usage Online ====

Many online [[Roleplay]]ers use double parentheses to connotate out-of-character (OOC) messages that one may send another.

Square brackets—also called crotchets or simply brackets (US)—are mainly used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', [[The University of Chicago Press]], 2003, §6.104&lt;/ref&gt;

A bracketed [[ellipsis]], […], is often used to indicate omitted material: "I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/60/960.html |title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more |work=bartleby.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524214802/http://www.bartleby.com/68/60/960.html |archivedate=24 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate when the original has been modified for clarity: "I appreciate it [the honor], but I must refuse", and "the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt". Or one can quote the original statement "I hate to do laundry" with a (sometimes grammatical) modification inserted: He "hate[s] to do laundry".

Additionally, a small letter can be replaced by a capital one, when the beginning of the original text is omitted for [[succinctness]], for example, when referring to a [[verbose]] original: "To the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all, they have, as the saying goes, done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination", it can be quoted succinctly as: "[P]olicymakers […] made use of economic analysis […] the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination." When nested parentheses are needed, brackets are used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.102 and §6.106&lt;/ref&gt; When deeper levels of nesting are needed, convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level.

Alternatively, empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material, usually single letter only. The original "Reading is also a process and it also changes you." can be rewritten in a quote as: It has been suggested that reading can "also change[] you".

The bracketed expression "[''[[sic]]'']" is used after a quote or reprinted text to indicate the passage appears exactly as in the original source, where it may otherwise appear that a mistake has been made in reproduction.

In translated works, brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.105&lt;/ref&gt;
For example: ''He is trained in the way of the open hand [karate].''

====Usage in proofreading====
Brackets (called ''move-left symbols'' or ''move right symbols'') are added to the sides of text in [[proofreading]] to indicate changes in indentation:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Move left
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| [To Fate I sue, of other means bereft, the only refuge for the wretched left.
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Center
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| ]Paradise Lost[
|-
!  style="width:15%; text-align:left;"| Move up
|  style="width:85%; text-align:left;"| [[File:Quote to be Moved Up.svg|330px]]
|}

====Usage in scientific fields====
Brackets are used in [[mathematics]] in a variety of notations, including standard notations for [[commutator]]s, the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]], [[Equivalence class#Notation and formal definition|equivalence classes]], the [[Iverson bracket]], and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. Square brackets may also represent closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s; &lt;math&gt; [0,5] &lt;/math&gt; for example, represents the set of real numbers from 0 to 5 inclusive.

Brackets can also be used in [[chemistry]] to represent the [[concentration]] of a [[chemical substance]] or to denote distributed charge in a [[Complex (chemistry)|complex ion]].

Brackets are used in many computer [[programming language]]s, primarily to force the order of evaluation and for parameter lists and [[array data structure|array]] indexing. But they are also used to denote general tuples, sets and other structures, just as in mathematics. There may be several other uses as well, depending on the language at hand.

====Other uses====
In linguistics, [[phonetic transcription]]s are generally enclosed within brackets,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.'', The University of Chicago Press, 2003, §6.107&lt;/ref&gt; often using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], whereas [[phoneme|phonemic]] transcriptions typically use paired [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]es. Pipes (| |) are often used to indicate a [[Morphophoneme|morphophonemic]] rather than phonemic representation. Other conventions are double slashes (// //), double pipes (|| ||) and curly brackets ({ }). In [[lexicography]], square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the [[etymology]] of the word the entry defines.

Brackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalizing a document. They often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain [[case law]] decisions.

=== Curly brackets {{anchor|Braces|Curly bracket}} ===
[[File:Curly Bracket Notation.png|thumb|left|An example of when to use a curly bracket, in this case grouping multiple sentences together.]]
{{Wiktionary|curly bracket}}

Curly brackets '''{''' and '''}''' are also called '''braces''' in the United States (or, colloquially, '''squiggly brackets'''). They are rarely used in prose and have no widely accepted use in [[formal writing]], but may be used to mark words or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s that should be taken as a group, to avoid confusion when other types of brackets are already in use, or for a special purpose specific to the publication (such as in a dictionary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/127892/are-curly-braces-ever-used-in-normal-text-if-not-why-were-they-created |title=Are curly braces ever used in normal text? If not, why were they created? |access-date=24 April 2018 |website=Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, they are used to indicate a group of lines that should be taken together, as in when referring to several lines of poetry that should be repeated.

In music, they are known as [[accolade (notation)|accolade]]s or "[[brace (music)|braces]]", and connect two or more lines (staves) of music that are played simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u%2B007B |title=&gt; U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET |website= Decodeunicode.org {{^|access-date=3 May 2009}} |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121802/http://www.decodeunicode.org/u%2B007B |archive-date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]] they delimit [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s, and in writing, they may be used similarly, "Select your animal {goat, sheep, cow, horse} and follow me". In many programming languages, they enclose groups of [[Statement (programming)|statement]]s and create a local [[Scope (computer science)|scope]]. Such languages ([[C (programming language)|C]] being one of the best-known examples) are therefore called [[curly bracket language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riedquat.de/prog/style |title=Brace and Indent Styles and Code Convention |work=riedquat.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070732/http://www.riedquat.de/prog/style |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[classical mechanics]], curly brackets are often also used to denote the [[Poisson bracket]] between two quantities.

=== Angle brackets {{anchor|Chevrons}} ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
{{redirect|Angle bracket|a device used for joining|Angle bracket (fastener)}}
{{Wiktionary|angle bracket|chevron}}

[[Wikt:chevron|Chevrons]] {{angbr|&amp;nbsp;}}, similar to the commonly used [[less-than sign|less-than]] (&lt;) and [[greater-than sign]] (&gt;), are often used to enclose highlighted material.

In physical sciences, chevrons are used to denote an average over time or over another continuous parameter. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle V(t)^2 \right\rangle = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} V(t)^2\,{\rm{d}}t. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[inner product]] of two vectors is commonly written as {{math|{{angbr|''a'',''b''}}}}, but the notation {{math|(''a'',''b'')}} is also used.

In mathematical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]], it is common to write the inner product between elements as {{math|{{bra-ket|''a''|''b''}}}}, as a short version of {{math|{{bra|''a''}}·{{ket|''b''}}}}, or {{math|{{bra|''a''}}''Ô''{{ket|''b''}}}}, where {{math|''Ô''}} is an [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. This is known as Dirac notation or [[bra–ket notation]].

In [[set theory]], chevrons or parentheses are used to denote [[ordered pair]]s and other [[tuple]]s, whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets.

In [[linguistics]], chevrons indicate [[grapheme]]s (i.e., written letters) or [[orthography]], as in "The English word {{IPA|/kæt/}} is spelled {{angbr|cat}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauer|first1=Laurie|title=The Linguistics Student's Handbook|date=2007|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|location=Edinburgh|page=99|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsrtrmHkLvoC&amp;pg=PA99|chapter=Notational conventions. Brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Keith|title=The Routledge Handbook of Linguistics|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=60|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vssCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|chapter=Writing systems: methods for recording language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

In [[epigraphy]], they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the Latin script.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt;

In [[textual criticism]], and hence in many editions of pre-modern works, chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost; the editor will often insert their own reconstruction where possible within them.&lt;ref name="Trask"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trask|first1=Robert Lawrence|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|date=2000|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;pg=PA22|chapter=Angle brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrons are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken, such as:
:{{angbr| What an unusual flower! }}

The mathematical or logical symbols for ''greater-than'' (&amp;gt;) and ''less-than'' (&amp;lt;) are [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] symbols; when either symbol is bisected by a vertical line, it represents "not greater than" or "not less than," respectively. These [[symbol]]s are not punctuation marks when used, as intended, to represent an inequality. However, as true chevrons are not present on [[computer keyboard]]s, the available less-than and greater-than symbols are often used instead. They are loosely referred to as ''angle[d] brackets'' or ''chevrons'' in this case, but more properly — and less confusingly — as ''pointy brackets'' (see the [[#Names for various bracket symbols|Names]] section above).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Single and double pairs of comparison operators (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) (meaning ''much smaller than'' and ''much greater than'') are sometimes used as a fallback instead of [[guillemet]]s («, ») (used as [[quotation mark]]s in many languages) when the proper characters are not available on the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] nor in the [[input method editor|input editor]]. Similarly, early Internet messaging conventions developed to use the ''greater-than'' sign (&amp;gt;), available in the [[ASCII#Character set|ASCII character set]], to mark quoted lines. This format, known as [[Usenet quoting]], is used by email clients when operating in [[plain text]] mode.

In [[comic book]]s, chevrons are often used to mark dialogue that has been translated notionally from another language; in other words, if a character is speaking another language, instead of writing in the other language and providing a translation, one writes the translated text within chevrons. Of course, since no foreign language is actually written, this is only ''notionally'' translated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In [[continuum mechanics]], chevrons may be used as [[Macaulay brackets]].

In [[Quotation mark#Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks|East Asian punctuation]], angle brackets are used as quotation marks. Chevron-like symbols are part of standard [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] punctuation, where they generally enclose the titles of books: ︿ and ﹀ or ︽ and ︾ for traditional [[tategaki|vertical printing]], and 〈 and 〉 or 《 and 》 for [[yokogaki|horizontal]] printing.

=== Lenticular brackets ===
{{Wiktionary|【 】}}

Some [[East Asia]]n languages use lenticular brackets 【 】, a combination of square brackets and round brackets called {{lang|zh|方頭括號}} (''fāngtóu kuòhào'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and {{lang|ja|
すみ付き}} (''sumitsuki'') in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. {{clarify|text=They are used for inference in Chinese|date=April 2017}} and used in titles and headings in Japanese.

=== Floor and ceiling corners ===
{{Wiktionary|⌊ ⌋|⌈ ⌉}}
The floor corner brackets ⌊ and ⌋, the ceiling corner brackets ⌈ and ⌉ are  used to denote the integer [[floor and ceiling functions]].

=== Quine corners and half brackets ===

The Quine corners ⌜ and ⌝ have at least two uses in [[mathematical logic]]: either as [[quasi-quotation]], a generalization of quotation marks, or to denote the [[Gödel numbering|Gödel number]] of the enclosed [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]].

Half brackets are used in English to mark added text, such as in translations: "Bill saw ⸤her⸥".

In editions of [[papyrology|papyrological]] texts, half brackets, ⸤ and ⸥ or ⸢ and ⸣, enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage, but can be restored by virtue of another source, such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;M.L. West (1973) ''Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique'' (Stuttgart) 81.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Callimachus]] ''Iambus'' 1.2 reads: ἐκ τῶν ὅκου βοῦν κολλύ⸤βου π⸥ιπρήσκουσιν. A hole in the papyrus has obliterated βου π, but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem. Second intermittent sources can be between ⸢ and ⸣.  Quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets.&lt;ref name="Unicode Miscellaneous Technical"/&gt;

=== Double brackets ===

Double brackets (or white square brackets), ⟦&amp;nbsp;⟧,  are used to indicate the ''semantic evaluation function'' in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] for natural language and [[denotational semantics]] for programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;Dowty, D., Wall, R. and Peters, S.: 1981, Introduction to Montague semantics, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. and Strachey, C.: 1971, Toward a mathematical semantics for computer languages, Oxford
University Computing Laboratory, Programming Research Group.&lt;/ref&gt; The brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its “denotation” or semantic value. Double brackets may also refer to the mathematical [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]].

=== Brackets with quills ===

Known as "spike parentheses" ({{lang-sv|piggparenteser}}) ⁅ and ⁆ are used in Swedish dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:sv:Parentes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==

===Computing===

The various bracket characters are frequently used in many [[programming language]]s as [[operator (computer programming)|operator]]s or for other [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] markup. For instance, in [[C (programming language)|C]]-like languages, &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; are often used to delimit a [[code block]], and the parameters of [[method call]]s are generally enclosed by &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

In C, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and other C-derived languages—as well as in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]-influenced languages that have adopted C/Java syntax, such as [[JavaScript]]—the "&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;" symbols are referred to as "braces" or "curly braces" and never as brackets. Since the term "brace" is documented in the definitive programming specifications for these languages, it is preferable to use the correct term brace so there is no confusion between the brace (used to denote compound statements) and the bracket, used to denote other concepts, such as [[array data structure|array]] indices.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie. "The C Programming Language", 1988. p. 7. {{ISBN|0-13-110370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup, "The C++ Programming Language", 2013. p.39. {{ISBN|0-13-352285-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
{{main|Bracket (mathematics)}}
In addition to the use of [[#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] to specify the [[order of operations]], both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], also referred to as a half-open range. The notation {{closed-open|{{mvar|a}},{{mvar|c}}}} is used to indicate an interval from {{mvar|a}} to {{mvar|c}} that is inclusive of {{mvar|a}} but exclusive of {{mvar|c}}. That is, {{closed-open|5, 12}} would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any [[finite set|finite]] number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation {{math|[5, 12[}} is also used for this. The endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as ''closed'', whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as ''open''. If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as ''closed'' or ''open'' as appropriate. Whenever [[Extended real number line|+∞]] or −∞ is used as an endpoint, it is normally considered ''open'' and adjoined to a parenthesis. See [[Interval (mathematics)]] for a more complete treatment.

In [[quantum mechanics]], chevrons are also used as part of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac's]] formalism, [[bra–ket notation]], to note vectors from the [[dual space]]s of the Bra&amp;nbsp;{{angbr|{{math|''A''&amp;#124;}} and the Ket&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;#124;''B''}}}}. Mathematicians will also commonly write {{angbr|{{math|''a'', ''b''}}}} for the [[inner product]] of two vectors. In statistical mechanics, chevrons denote ensemble or time average. Chevrons are used in [[group theory]] to write [[group presentation]]s, and to denote the [[group generators|subgroup generated]] by a collection of elements. Note that [[obtuse angle]]d chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs &amp;lt;&amp;gt;, which are sometimes used as a [[typographic approximation]] of chevrons.

In [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]], brackets denote the [[commutator]]. In group theory, the commutator {{math|[{{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|h}}]}} is commonly defined as {{math|{{mvar|g}}&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; {{mvar|h}}&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; {{mvar|g}} {{mvar|h}} }}. In ring theory, the commutator {{math|[{{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}]}} is defined as {{math|{{mvar|a}} {{mvar|b}} − {{mvar|b}} {{mvar|a}} }}. Furthermore, in ring theory, braces denote the [[anticommutator]] where {{math|{{{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}}}} is defined as {{math|{{mvar|a}} {{mvar|b}} + {{mvar|b}} {{mvar|a}} }}. The bracket is also used to denote the [[Lie derivative]], or more generally the Lie bracket in any [[Lie algebra]].

Various notations, like the [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations, or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose.

In the [[Z notation|Z]] [[formal specification]] language, braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence.

===Accounting===
Traditionally in [[Accountancy|accounting]], contra amounts are placed in parentheses.  A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have brackets and vice versa.

===Law===
Brackets are used in some countries in the citation of [[law report]]s to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example: Chronicle Pub. Co. v. [[Superior Court]], (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, [7 Cal.Rptr. 109]. In some other countries (such as [[England and Wales]]), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given. For example, National Coal Board v England [1954] AC 403, is in the 1954 volume of the Appeal Cases reports although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier, whereas (1954) 98 Sol Jo 176 reports a decision from 1954, in volume 98 of the Solicitor's Journal which may be published in 1955 or later.

When quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in brackets within the quotation. For example: Plaintiff asserts his cause is just, stating, "[m]y causes is [[sic|{{bracket|''sic''}}]] just." Although in the original quoted sentence the word "my" was capitalized, it has been modified in the quotation and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error, the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with "[''sic'']" (Latin for 'thus'). (''California Style Manual'', section 4:59 (4th ed.))

===Sports===
[[Bracket (tournament)|Tournament brackets]], the diagrammatic representation of the series of games played during a tournament usually leading to a single winner, are so named for their resemblance to brackets or braces.

&lt;references group="e"&gt;
&lt;ref name="lang-rang"&gt;&amp;amp;lang; and &amp;amp;rang; were tied to the deprecated symbols U+2329 and U+232A in HTML4 and MathML2, but are being migrated to U+27E8 and U+27E9 for HTML5 and MathML3, as defined in [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/#diff-xhtml1 XML Entity Definitions for Characters].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="301E"&gt;This is fullwidth version of U+2033 DOUBLE PRIME. In vertical texts, U+301F LOW DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK is preferred.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the [[IBM 7030 Stretch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bob |first=Bemer |title=The Great Curly Brace Trace Chase |url=http://www.bobbemer.com/BRACES.HTM |accessdate =2009-09-05 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle brackets or chevrons at U+27E8 and U+27E9 are for mathematical use and Western languages, whereas U+3008 and U+3009 are for East Asian languages. The chevrons at U+2329 and U+232A are deprecated in favour of the U+3008 and U+3009 East Asian angle brackets. Unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in Western texts,&lt;ref name="Unicode Miscellaneous Technical" /&gt; because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300x and thus likely to render as double-width symbols. The ''less-than'' and ''greater-than'' symbols are often used as replacements for chevrons.

In [[mathematics]], a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] may be '''continuous''' or '''discrete'''. If it can take on two particular [[real number|real]] values such that it can also take on all real values between them (even values that are arbitrarily close together), the variable is continuous in that [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. If it can take on a value such that there is a non-[[infinitesimal]] gap on each side of it containing no values that the variable can take on, then it is discrete around that value.&lt;ref&gt;K.D. Joshi, ''Foundations of Discrete Mathematics'', 1989, New Age International Limited, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RM1D3mFw2u0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=continuous+discrete+variable+math&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uGtCVeT-F-TjsAS4noGYDw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=continuous%20discrete%20variable%20math&amp;f=false], page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;   In some contexts a variable can be discrete in some ranges of the [[number line]] and continuous in others.

==Continuous variable==

A '''continuous variable'''  is one which can take on infinitely many, [[Uncountable set|uncountable]] values.

For example, a variable over a non-empty range of the [[real number]]s is continuous, if it can take on any value in that range. The reason is that any range of real numbers between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{R}; a \neq b&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and uncountable.

Methods of [[calculus]] are often used in problems in which the variables are continuous, for example in continuous [[optimization]] problems.

In [[statistics|statistical theory]], the [[probability distribution]]s of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of [[probability density function]]s.

In [[continuous time|continuous-time]] [[dynamical system|dynamics]], the variable ''time'' is treated as continuous, and the equation describing the evolution of some variable over time is a [[differential equation]]. The [[instantaneous rate of change]] is a well-defined concept.

==Discrete variable==
In contrast, a '''discrete variable''' over a particular range of real values is one for which, for any value in the range that the variable is permitted to take on, there is a positive minimum distance to the nearest other permissible value. The number of permitted values is either finite or [[countably infinite]]. Common examples are variables that must be integers, non-negative integers, positive integers, or only the integers 0 and 1.

Methods of calculus do not readily lend themselves to problems involving discrete variables. Examples of problems involving discrete variables include [[integer programming]].

In statistics, the probability distributions of discrete variables can be expressed in terms of [[probability mass function]]s.

In [[discrete time]] dynamics, the variable ''time'' is treated as discrete, and the equation of evolution of some variable over time is called a [[difference equation]].

In [[econometrics]] and more generally in [[regression analysis]], sometimes some of the variables being [[empirical]]ly related to each other are 0-1 variables, being permitted to take on only those two values. A variable of this type is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. If the [[dependent variable]] is a dummy variable, then [[logistic regression]] or [[probit regression]] is commonly employed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22916">In [[mathematical logic]], the theory of [[infinite set]]s was first developed by [[Georg Cantor]]. Although this work has become a thoroughly standard fixture of classical set theory, it has been criticized in several areas by mathematicians and philosophers.

[[Cantor's theorem]] implies that there are sets having [[cardinality]] greater than the infinite cardinality of the set of [[natural numbers]]. Cantor's argument for this theorem is presented with one small change. This argument can be improved by using a definition he gave later. The resulting argument uses only five axioms of [[set theory]].

Cantor's set theory was controversial at the start, but later became largely accepted. In particular, there have been objections to its use of infinite sets.

== Cantor's argument ==

[[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor's first proof]] that infinite sets can have different [[Cardinality|cardinalities]] was published in 1874. This proof demonstrates that the set of natural numbers and the set of [[real number]]s have different cardinalities. It uses the theorem that a bounded increasing [[sequence]] of real numbers has a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], which can be proved by using Cantor's or [[Richard Dedekind]]'s construction of the [[irrational number]]s. Because [[Leopold Kronecker]] did not accept these constructions, Cantor was motivated to develop a new proof.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, pp. 67&amp;ndash;68, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, he published "a much simpler proof … which does not depend on considering the irrational numbers."&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1891, p. 75; English translation: Ewald p. 920.&lt;/ref&gt; His new proof uses his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] to prove that there exists an infinite set with a larger number of elements (or greater cardinality) than the set of natural numbers '''N'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;…}. This larger set consists of the elements (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…), where each ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is either ''m'' or ''w''.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these elements corresponds to a [[subset]] of '''N'''—namely, the element (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…) corresponds to {''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''': &amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''}. So Cantor's argument implies that the set of all subsets of '''N''' has greater cardinality than '''N'''. The set of all subsets of '''N''' is denoted by ''P''('''N'''), the [[power set]] of '''N'''.

Cantor generalized his argument to an arbitrary set ''A'' and the set consisting of all functions from ''A'' to {0,&amp;nbsp;1}.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben 1979, pp.166&amp;ndash;167.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these functions corresponds to a subset of ''A'', so his generalized argument implies the theorem: The power set ''P''(''A'') has  greater cardinality than ''A''. This is known as [[Cantor's theorem]].

The argument below is a modern version of Cantor's argument that uses power sets (for his original argument, see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). By presenting a modern argument, it is possible to see which assumptions of [[axiomatic set theory]] are used. The first part of the argument proves that '''N''' and ''P''('''N''') have different cardinalities:
 
* There exists at least one infinite set.  This assumption (not formally specified by Cantor) is captured in formal set theory by the [[axiom of infinity]]. This axiom implies that '''N''', the set of all natural numbers, exists.
* ''P''('''N'''), the set of all subsets of '''N''',  exists. In formal set theory, this is implied by the [[axiom of power set|power set axiom]], which says that for every set there is a set of all of its subsets.
* The concept of "having the same number" or "having the same cardinality" can be captured by the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]].  This (purely definitional) assumption is sometimes known as [[Hume's principle]].  As [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] said, "If a waiter wishes to be certain of laying exactly as many knives on a table as plates, he has no need to count either of them; all he has to do is to lay immediately to the right of every plate a knife, taking care that every knife on the table lies immediately to the right of a plate.  Plates and knives are thus correlated one to one."&lt;ref&gt;Frege 1884, trans. 1953, §70.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets in such a correlation are called [[equinumerous]], and the correlation is called a one-to-one correspondence.
* A set cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with its power set. This implies that '''N''' and ''P''('''N''') have different cardinalities.  It depends on very few assumptions of [[set theory]], and, as [[John Penn Mayberry|John P. Mayberry]] puts it, is a "simple and beautiful argument" that is "pregnant with consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Mayberry 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the argument:&lt;br /&gt;

::Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; be its power set. The following theorem will be proved: If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A),&lt;/math&gt; then it is not [[onto]]. This theorem implies that there is no one-to-one correspondence between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; since such a correspondence must be onto. Proof of theorem: Define the diagonal subset &lt;math&gt;D = \{x \in A : x \notin f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;D \in P(A),&lt;/math&gt; proving that for all &lt;math&gt;x \in A,\, D \ne f(x)&lt;/math&gt; will imply that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not onto. Let &lt;math&gt;x \in A.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x \in D \Leftrightarrow x \notin f(x),&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;x \notin D \Leftrightarrow x \in f(x).&lt;/math&gt; So if &lt;math&gt;x \in D,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \notin f(x);&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;x \notin D,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Since one of these sets contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the other does not, &lt;math&gt;D \ne f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is not in the [[image]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not onto.

Next Cantor shows that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. From this and the fact that &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have different cardinalities, he concludes that &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; has greater cardinality than &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This conclusion uses his 1878 definition: If ''A'' and ''B'' have different cardinalities, then either ''B'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''A'' (in this case, ''B'' has less cardinality than ''A'') or ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'' (in this case, ''B'' has greater cardinality than ''A'').&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1878, p. 242. Cantor 1891, p. 77; English translation: Ewald p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition leaves out the case where ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous with a subset of the other set—that is, ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'' and ''B'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''A''. Because Cantor implicitly assumed that cardinalities are [[linearly ordered]], this case cannot occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett 1984, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After using his 1878 definition, Cantor stated that in an 1883 article he proved that cardinalities are [[well-ordered]], which implies they are linearly ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1891, p. 77; English translation: Ewald p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; This proof used his well-ordering principle "every set can be well-ordered", which he called a "law of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The well-ordering principle is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1895, Cantor began to regard the well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1982, p. 51. A discussion of Cantor's proof is in [[Absolute infinite, well-ordering theorem, and paradoxes]]. Part of Cantor's proof and [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]]'s criticism of it is in a reference note.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Cantor also gave a new definition of "greater than" that correctly defines this concept without the aid of his well-ordering principle.&lt;ref name=Cantor1895&gt;Cantor 1895, pp. 483&amp;ndash;484; English translation: Cantor 1954, pp. 89&amp;ndash;90.&lt;/ref&gt; By using Cantor's new definition, the modern argument that ''P''('''N''') has greater cardinality than '''N''' can be completed using weaker assumptions than his original argument:

* The concept of "having greater cardinality" can be captured by Cantor's 1895 definition: ''B'' has greater cardinality than ''A'' if (1) ''A'' is equinumerous with a subset of ''B'', and (2) ''B'' is not equinumerous with a subset of ''A''.&lt;ref name=Cantor1895 /&gt; Clause (1) says ''B'' is at least as large as ''A'', which is consistent with our definition of "having the same cardinality". Clause (2) implies that the case where ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous with a subset of the other set is false. Since clause (2) says that ''A'' is not at least as large as ''B'', the two clauses together say that ''B'' is larger (has greater cardinality) than ''A''.
* The power set &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; has greater cardinality than &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; which implies that ''P''('''N''') has greater cardinality than '''N'''. Here is the proof:
{{plainlist|indent=2}}
* (1) Define the subset &lt;math&gt;P_1 = \{\,y \in P(A): \exists x \in A\,(y = \{x\})\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;  Define &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \{x\},&lt;/math&gt; which maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;f(x_1) = f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2, \, f&lt;/math&gt; is a one-to-one correspondence from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;P(A).&lt;/math&gt;
* (2) Using [[proof by contradiction]], assume that &lt;math&gt;A_1,&lt;/math&gt; a subset of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; is equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;P(A)\,.&lt;/math&gt; Then there is a one-to-one correspondence &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A).&lt;/math&gt; Define &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A)\text{:}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \in A_1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h(x) = g(x);&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \in A \setminus A_1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h(x) = \{ \, \}.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P(A), \, h&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;P(A),&lt;/math&gt; contradicting the theorem above stating that a function from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is not onto. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is not equinumerous with a subset of &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;
{{endplainlist}}

Besides the axioms of infinity and power set, the axioms of [[Axiom of separation|separation]], [[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], and [[Axiom of pairing|pairing]] were used in the modern argument. For example, the axiom of separation was used to define the diagonal subset &lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; the axiom of extensionality was used to prove &lt;math&gt;D \ne f(x),&lt;/math&gt; and the axiom of pairing was used in the definition of the subset &lt;math&gt;P_1.&lt;/math&gt;

== Reception of the argument ==

Initially, Cantor's theory was controversial among mathematicians and (later) philosophers. As [[Leopold Kronecker]] claimed: "I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory – philosophy or theology, but I am sure that there is no mathematics there".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Many mathematicians agreed with Kronecker that the completed infinite may be part of [[philosophy]] or [[theology]], but that it has no proper place in mathematics. Logician {{Harvard citations|txt = yes|last = Hodges|first = Wilfrid|authorlink = Wilfrid Hodges|year = 1998}} has commented on the energy devoted to refuting this "harmless little argument" (i.e. [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]) asking, "what had it done to anyone to make them angry with it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wilfrid | last = Hodges | author-link = Wilfred Hodges | year = 1998 | title = An Editor Recalls Some Hopeless Papers | periodical = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | jstor = 421003 | doi = 10.2307/421003 | publisher = Association for Symbolic Logic| citeseerx = 10.1.1.27.6154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also taken issue with Cantor's proof regarding the cardinality of the power set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Perez |first = Juan A.|eprint=1002.4433 |title=Addressing mathematical inconsistency: Cantor and Gödel refuted |year=2010|class = math.GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zenkin|first1=Alexander|title=Cantor's Diagonal Argument: A New Aspect|url=http://www.ccas.ru/alexzen/papers/CANTOR-2003/Zenkin%20BSL-2.pdf|website=Dorodnitsyn Computing Center|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Solomon Feferman]] has referred to Cantor's theories as “simply not relevant to everyday mathematics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolchover|first1=Natalie|title=Dispute over Infinity Divides Mathematicians|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/infinity-logic-law/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Cantor, the notion of infinity was often taken as a useful abstraction which helped mathematicians reason about the finite world; for example the use of infinite limit cases in calculus.  The infinite was deemed to have at most a potential existence, rather than an actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alexander | last = Zenkin | year = 2004 | title = Logic Of Actual Infinity And G. Cantor's Diagonal Proof Of The Uncountability Of The Continuum | periodical = The Review of Modern Logic | volume = 9 | issue = 30 | pages = 27–80 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1203431978}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Actual infinity does not exist. What we call infinite is only the endless possibility of creating new objects no matter how many exist already".&lt;ref&gt;([[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] quoted from Kline 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s views on the subject can be paraphrased as: 'Infinity is nothing more than a figure of speech which helps us talk about limits. The notion of a completed infinity doesn't belong in mathematics'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=William|title=Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics|publisher=Penguin|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the only access we have to the infinite is through the notion of limits, and hence, we must not treat infinite sets as if they have an existence exactly comparable to the existence of finite sets.

Cantor's ideas ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by [[David Hilbert]], amongst others. Hilbert predicted: "No one will drive us from the paradise which Cantor created for us".&lt;ref&gt;(Hilbert, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; To which [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] replied "if one person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a joke?"&lt;ref&gt;(RFM V. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The rejection of Cantor's infinitary ideas influenced the development of schools of mathematics such as [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].

== Objection to the axiom of infinity ==
{{further information|Finitism}}

A common objection to Cantor's theory of infinite number involves the [[axiom of infinity]] (which is, indeed, an axiom and not a [[logical truth]]).  Mayberry has noted that "… the set-theoretical axioms that sustain modern mathematics are self-evident in differing degrees. One of them—indeed, the most important of them, namely Cantor's Axiom, the so-called Axiom of Infinity—has scarcely any claim to self-evidence at all …"&lt;ref&gt;Mayberry 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection is that the use of infinite sets is not adequately justified by analogy to finite sets. [[Hermann Weyl]] wrote:
{{quote|… classical logic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets …. Forgetful of this limited origin, one afterwards mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics, and finally applied it, without justification, to the mathematics of infinite sets. This is the Fall and original sin of [Cantor's] set theory …."&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The difficulty with finitism is to develop foundations of mathematics using finitist assumptions, that incorporates what everyone would reasonably regard as mathematics (for example, that includes [[real analysis]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1411">In [[mathematics]], '''corank''' is complementary to the concept of the rank of a mathematical object, and may refer to the dimension of the left [[Nullspace|nullspace of a matrix]], the dimension of the [[cokernel]] of a linear transformation of a vector space, or the number of elements of a [[Matroid rank|matroid minus its rank]]. 

== Left nullspace of a matrix ==
The corank of an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is &lt;math&gt;m-r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix. Equivalently, by the [[fundamental theorem of linear algebra]], it is the dimension of the left nullspace of the matrix.

== Cokernel of a linear transformation ==
Generalizing matrices to [[linear transformation]]s of [[vector space]]s, the corank of a linear transformation is the dimension of the [[cokernel]] of the transformation, which is the quotient of the [[codomain]] by the image of the transformation.

== Matroid ==
For a [[matroid]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements and [[matroid rank]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corank or nullity of the matroid is &lt;math&gt;n-r&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of [[linear matroid]]s this coincides with the matrix corank. In the case of [[graphic matroid]]s the corank is also known as the [[circuit rank]] or cyclomatic number.

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[mathematical space]] (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of [[coordinates]] needed to specify any [[Point (geometry)|point]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |title=Curious About Astronomy |publisher=Curious.astro.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111191053/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |title=MathWorld: Dimension |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325220941/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a [[Line (geometry)|line]] has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|event]]s that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[string theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|space]]s, independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.

The dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} by small balls of radius {{math|''ε''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract ''has four dimensions''", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract ''has dimension 4''", or: "The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4".

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[René Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schläfli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

===Vector spaces===
{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}
The dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.  

For the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].

===Manifolds===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]--&gt;
The uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.

For connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.

In [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &amp;#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.

====Complex dimension====

The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.  

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varieties===
{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}
The dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains &lt;math&gt;V_0\subsetneq V_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d&lt;/math&gt; of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of "&lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt;").

Each variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[group action|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''&amp;minus;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349–359|series=Progr. Math.|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2001|chapter-url=http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117052957/http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-17|df=}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krull dimension===
The [[Krull dimension]] of a [[commutative ring]] is the maximal length of chains of [[prime ideal]]s in it, a chain of length ''n'' being a sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0\subsetneq \mathcal{P}_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq\mathcal{P}_n &lt;/math&gt; of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

===Topological spaces===

For any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∞}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension −1, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} −1}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term "'''functionally open'''".

An [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.

Similarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}

===Hausdorff dimension===
The [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [[metric space]]s and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.&lt;ref name="Hausdorff dimension"&gt;[http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html Fractal Dimension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027003440/http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html |date=2006-10-27 }}, Boston University Department of Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; The [[box-counting dimension|box dimension]] or [[Minkowski dimension]] is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [[fractal dimension]]s that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title=Fractals and Disordered Systems |year=1991 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title= Fractals in Science |year=1994 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

===Hilbert spaces===
Every [[Hilbert space]] admits an [[orthonormal basis]], and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

== In physics ==

===Spatial dimensions===
Classical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)

===Time&lt;!--'Temporal dimension' and 'Temporal dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===
A '''temporal dimension'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the "[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].

===Additional dimensions===

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.
 
In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or "the bulk". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.

Extra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

== Networks and dimension ==

Some complex [[Network science|network]]s are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hernán A. |issue=7024|pages=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.

== In literature ==
{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}

[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of "dimension" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universe]]s or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.

One of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

The idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[—And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for "tesseracting the universe" or "folding" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].

== In philosophy ==

[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: "That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

"Space has Four Dimensions" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] "Dr. Mises". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this "shadow-man" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banchoff |first=Thomas F. |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |title=From Flatland to Hypergraphics: Interacting with Higher Dimensions |year=1990 |url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |doi=10.1179/030801890789797239 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=364 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414023125/http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story bears a strong similarity to the "[[Allegory of the Cave]]" presented in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' ([[Circa|c.]] 380&amp;nbsp;BC).

Simon Newcomb wrote an article for the ''Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society'' in 1898 entitled "The Philosophy of Hyperspace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newcomb |first=Simon |year=1898 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_42903 |title=The Philosophy of Hyperspace |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1898-00478-0 |volume=4 |issue=5 |page=187|bibcode=1994BAMaS..30..205W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Dalrymple Henderson coined the term "hyperspace philosophy", used to describe writing that uses higher dimensions to explore [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, in her 1983 thesis about the fourth dimension in early-twentieth-century art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kruger |first=Runette |journal=Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal |issue=5 |year=2007 |title=Art in the Fourth Dimension: Giving Form to Form – The Abstract Paintings of Piet Mondrian |page=11 |url=http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929071218/http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of "hyperspace philosophers" include [[Charles Howard Hinton]], the first writer, in 1888, to use the word "tesseract";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover |authorlink=Clifford Pickover |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009 |isbn=9781402757969 |contribution=Tesseract |page=282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA282 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330181025/https://books.google.com/books?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA282 |archivedate=2017-03-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">[[File:Dowker-notation-example.svg|thumb|200px|A knot diagram with crossings labelled for a Dowker sequence]]

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[knot theory]], the '''Dowker notation''', also called the '''Dowker&amp;ndash;Thistlethwaite notation''' or code, for a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is a sequence of even [[integer]]s.  The notation is named after [[Clifford Hugh Dowker]] and [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]], who refined a notation originally due to [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]. 

==Overview==
To generate the Dowker notation, traverse the knot using an arbitrary starting point and direction. Label each of the n crossings with the numbers 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;2''n'' in order of traversal (each crossing is visited and labelled twice), with the following modification: if the label is an even number and the strand followed crosses over at the crossing, then change the sign on the label to be a negative. When finished, each crossing will be labelled a pair of integers, one even and one odd. The Dowker notation is the sequence of even integer labels associated with the labels 1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 in turn.

For example, a [[knot diagram]] may have crossings labelled with the pairs (1,&amp;nbsp;6) (3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;12) (5,&amp;nbsp;2) (7,&amp;nbsp;8) (9,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;4) and (11,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;10). The Dowker notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;12&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;10.

A knot can be recovered from a Dowker sequence, but the recovered knot may differ from the original by being a reflection or (more generally) by having any [[connected sum]] component reflected in the line between its entry/exit points &amp;ndash; the Dowker notation is unchanged by these reflections. Knots tabulations typically consider only [[prime knot]]s and disregard [[chirality]], so this ambiguity does not affect the tabulation.

The [[ménage problem]], posed by Tait, concerns counting the number of different number sequences possible in this notation.

The '''European Congress of Mathematics''' ('''ECM''') is an international congress of the [[mathematics]] community, held every four years.  Its objectives are "to present various new aspects of pure and applied mathematics to a wide audience, to be a forum for discussion of the relationship between mathematics and society in Europe, and to enhance cooperation among mathematicians from all European countries."

The Congress is held under the auspices of the [[European Mathematical Society]] (EMS), and was one of its earliest initiatives. The [[European_Mathematical_Society#Prizes|EMS Prizes]] are awarded at the beginning of the Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7204">This page contains examples of [[Markov chain]]s in action.

== Board games played with dice ==

A game of [[snakes and ladders]] or any other game whose moves are determined entirely by [[dice]] is a Markov chain, indeed, an [[absorbing Markov chain]].  This is in contrast to card games such as [[blackjack]], where the cards represent a 'memory' of the past moves.  To see the difference, consider the probability for a certain event in the game.  In the above-mentioned dice games, the only thing that matters is the current state of the board.  The next state of the board depends on the current state, and the next roll of the dice.  It doesn't depend on how things got to their current state.  In a game such as blackjack, a player can gain an advantage by remembering which cards have already been shown (and hence which cards are no longer in the deck), so the next state (or hand) of the game is not independent of the past states.

== A center-biased random walk ==

Consider a [[random walk]] on the number line where, at each step, the position (call it ''x'') may change by +1 (to the right) or −1 (to the left) with probabilities:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{move~left}} = \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2} \left( \tfrac{x}{c+|x|} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{move~right}} = 1 - P_{\mathrm{move~left}}&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''c'' is a constant greater than 0)

For example, if the constant, ''c'', equals 1, the probabilities of a move to the left at positions ''x'' = −2,−1,0,1,2 are given by &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{6},\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{3}{4},\tfrac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The random walk has a centering effect that weakens as ''c'' increases.

Since the probabilities depend only on the current position (value of ''x'') and not on any prior positions, this biased random walk satisfies the definition of a Markov chain.

== A simple weather model ==

The probabilities of weather conditions (modeled as either rainy or sunny), given the weather on the preceding day,
can be represented by a [[Stochastic matrix|transition matrix]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry|last=Van Kampen|first=N.G.|publisher=North Holland Elsevier |year=2007|isbn=978-0-444-52965-7|location=NL|pages=73-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
    P = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
        0.5 &amp; 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix ''P'' represents the weather model in which a sunny day is 90%
likely to be followed by another sunny day, and a rainy day is 50% likely to
be followed by another rainy day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The columns can be labelled "sunny" and
"rainy", and the rows can be labelled in the same order.

[[File:Markov Chain weather model matrix as a graph.png|thumbnail|The above matrix as a graph.]]

(''P'')&lt;sub&gt;''i j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that, if a given day is of type ''i'', it will be
followed by a day of type ''j''.

Notice that the rows of ''P'' sum to 1: this is because ''P'' is a [[stochastic matrix]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Predicting the weather ===

The weather on day 1 is known to be sunny.  This is represented by a vector in which the "sunny" entry is 100%, and the "rainy" entry is 0%:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(0)} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp; 0
    \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The weather on day 2 can be predicted by:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(0)} P  = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp; 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
        0.5 &amp; 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
    
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1
    \end{bmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, there is a 90% chance that day 2 will also be sunny.

The weather on day 3 can be predicted in the same way:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(2)} =\mathbf{x}^{(1)} P  = \mathbf{x}^{(0)} P^2 
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 &amp; 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
        0.5 &amp; 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}^2
    
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.86 &amp; 0.14
    \end{bmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(2)} =\mathbf{x}^{(1)} P 
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
        0.5 &amp; 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
    
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.86 &amp; 0.14
    \end{bmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

General rules for day ''n'' are:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(n)} = \mathbf{x}^{(n-1)} P 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x}^{(n)} = \mathbf{x}^{(0)} P^n 
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Steady state of the weather ===

In this example, predictions for the weather on more distant days are increasingly
inaccurate and tend towards a [https://www.math.drexel.edu/~jwd25/LM_SPRING_07/lectures/Markov.html steady state vector].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry|last=Van Kampen|first=N.G.|publisher=North Holland Elsevier |year=2007|isbn=978-0-444-52965-7|location=NL|pages=73-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This vector represents
the probabilities of sunny and rainy weather on all days, and is independent
of the initial weather.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The steady state vector is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{q} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbf{x}^{(n)}
&lt;/math&gt;

but converges to a strictly positive vector only if ''P'' is a regular transition matrix (that is, there
is at least one ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with all non-zero entries).

Since the '''q''' is independent from initial conditions, it must be unchanged when transformed by ''P''. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This makes it an [[eigenvector]] (with [[eigenvalue]] 1), and means it can be derived from ''P''. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For the weather example:

:&lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
        P &amp; =  \begin{bmatrix}
            0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
            0.5 &amp; 0.5
        \end{bmatrix}
        \\
        \mathbf{q} P  &amp; =  \mathbf{q}
        &amp; &amp;  \text{(} \mathbf{q} \text{ is unchanged by } P \text{.)}
        \\
        &amp; =  \mathbf{q}I 
        \\
        \mathbf{q} (P - I)  
        &amp; =  \mathbf{0} \\
        \mathbf{q} \left( \begin{bmatrix}
            0.9 &amp; 0.1 \\
            0.5 &amp; 0.5
        \end{bmatrix}
        -
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 &amp; 0 \\
            0 &amp; 1
        \end{bmatrix}
        \right) 
        &amp; =  \mathbf{0} \\
        \mathbf{q} \begin{bmatrix}
            -0.1 &amp; 0.1 \\
            0.5 &amp; -0.5
        \end{bmatrix} 
        &amp; =  \mathbf{0} \\

    \begin{bmatrix}
        q_1 &amp; q_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -0.1 &amp; 0.1 \\
        0.5 &amp; -0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
    &amp; = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 &amp; 0
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    -0.1 q_1 + 0.5 q_2 &amp;= 0
    \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and since they are a probability vector we know that 
:&lt;math&gt;
q_1 + q_2 = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this pair of simultaneous equations gives the steady state distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;
    \begin{bmatrix}
        q_1 &amp; q_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.833 &amp; 0.167
    \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In conclusion, in the long term, about 83.3% of days are sunny.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14186">'''Financial risk management''' is the practice of economic value in a [[business|firm]] by using [[financial instruments]] to manage exposure to [[risk]]: [[operational risk]], [[credit risk]] and [[market risk]], [[foreign exchange risk]], [[shape risk]], [[volatility risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[inflation risk]], [[business risk]], [[legal risk]], [[reputational risk]], sector risk etc. Similar to general [[risk management]], financial risk management requires identifying its sources, measuring it, and plans to address them.&lt;ref name="Christoffersen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter F. Christoffersen|title=Elements of Financial Risk Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkcMBGYbRasC|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374448-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial risk management can be qualitative and quantitative. As a specialization of [[risk]] management, financial risk management focuses on when and how to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] using financial instruments to manage costly exposures to risk.&lt;ref name="Malz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan M. Malz|title=Financial Risk Management: Models, History, and Institutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFX2f6AxH1QC|date=13 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-02291-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the banking sector worldwide, the [[Basel Accords]] are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.&lt;ref&gt;Van Deventer, Donald R., and Kenji Imai. Credit risk models and the Basel Accords. Singapore: John Wiley &amp; Sons (Asia), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drumond, Ines. "Bank capital requirements, business cycle fluctuations and the Basel Accords: a synthesis." Journal of Economic Surveys 23.5 (2009): 798-830.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of financial risk management==
Finance theory (i.e., [[financial economics]]) prescribes that a firm should take on a project if it increases [[shareholder]] value. Finance theory also shows that [[management|firm managers]] cannot create value for shareholders, also called its [[investment|investors]], by taking on projects that shareholders could do for themselves at the same cost.&lt;ref name="KUMAH"&gt;{{cite book|author=EMMANUEL ATTAH KUMAH|title=COST OF CAPITAL (A FINANCIAL TOOL TO CREATE AND MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK2nBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-304-26045-1|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When applied to financial risk management, this implies that firm managers should not hedge risks that investors can hedge for themselves at the same cost. This notion was captured by the so-called "hedging irrelevance proposition":&lt;ref name="CHANDRASEKHAR"&gt;{{cite book|author1=KRISHNAMURTI CHANDRASEKHAR|author2=Krishnamurti &amp; Viswanath (eds.) "|author3=Vishwanath S. R.|title=Advanced Corporate Finance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNFX-gh6LlAC&amp;pg=PA178|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3611-7|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''In a [[perfect market]], the firm cannot create value by hedging a risk when the price of bearing that [[risk]] within the firm is the same as the [[price]] of bearing it outside of the firm.'' In practice, financial markets are not likely to be perfect markets.&lt;ref name="Hampton1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=John J. Hampton|title=Modern Financial Theory: Perfect and Imperfect Markets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NsJAQAAMAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Reston Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8359-4553-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoque2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zahirul Hoque|title=Handbook of Cost and Management Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wh0PQv0iYUC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2005|publisher=Spiramus Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-904905-01-1|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirt C.

This suggests that firm managers likely have many opportunities to create value for shareholders using financial risk management, wherein they have to determine which risks are cheaper for the firm to manage than the shareholders. [[Market risk]]s that result in unique risks for the firm are commonly the best candidates for financial risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Corporate Finance: Part I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q6kvC8YenwC&amp;pg=PA32|publisher=Bookboon|isbn=978-87-7681-568-4|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of financial risk management change dramatically in the international realm. [[Multinational Corporation]]s are faced with many different obstacles in overcoming these challenges. There has been some research on the risks firms must consider when operating in many countries, such as the three kinds of foreign exchange exposure for various future time horizons: transactions exposure,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=EFA8D4FB63329F2C94F48279646551BF?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1649008 (contrary to conventional wisdom it may be rational to hedge translation exposure.

In [[mathematics]], '''ideal theory''' is the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[commutative ring]]s; and is the precursor name for the contemporary subject of [[commutative algebra]]. The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] in [[algebraic geometry]], and the [[ideal class group]] in [[algebraic number theory]], of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] text on [[abstract algebra]] from around 1930.

The ideal theory in question had been based on [[elimination theory]], but in line with [[David Hilbert]]'s taste moved away from [[algorithm]]ic methods. [[Gröbner basis]] theory has now reversed the trend, for [[computer algebra]].

The importance of the ideal in general of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], more general than an ''ideal'', probably led to the perception that ''ideal theory'' was too narrow a description. [[Valuation theory]], too, was an important technical extension, and was used by [[Helmut Hasse]] and [[Oscar Zariski]].  [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] used ''commutative algebra''; sometimes ''local algebra'' is applied to the theory of [[local ring]]s. [[D. G. Northcott]]'s 1953 [[Cambridge Tract]] ''Ideal Theory'' (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.

'''John Wallis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒ|l|ɪ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wallis ''Random House Dictionary''].&lt;/ref&gt; 3 December 1616 – 8 November 1703&lt;ref&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style dates]]: 23 November 1616 – 28 October 1703.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English clergyman and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] who is given partial credit for the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Between 1643 and 1689 he served as chief [[cryptographer]] for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and, later, the royal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David Eugene|authorlink=David Eugene Smith|title=John Wallis As a Cryptographer|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1917|volume=24|issue=2|pages=82–96|mr=1560009|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1917-03015-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with introducing the [[symbol]] ∞ to represent the concept of [[infinity]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He similarly used [[1/∞]] for an [[infinitesimal]].

== Life ==
John Wallis was born in [[Ashford, Kent]], the third of five children of Reverend John Wallis and Joanna Chapman. He was initially educated at a school in Ashford but moved to James Movat's school in [[Tenterden]] in 1625 following an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. Wallis was first exposed to mathematics in 1631, at Martin Holbeach's [[Felsted School|school in Felsted]]; he enjoyed maths, but his study was erratic, since "mathematics, at that time with us, were scarce looked on as academical studies, but rather mechanical" ([[#References|Scriba 1970]]).

As it was intended he should be a doctor, he was sent in 1632 to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLS632J|name=Wallys, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he kept an ''act'' on the doctrine of the [[circulation of the blood]]; that was said to have been the first occasion in Europe on which this theory was publicly maintained in a disputation. His interests, however, centred on mathematics. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1637 and a Master's in 1640, afterwards entering the priesthood. From 1643 to 1649, he served as a nonvoting scribe at the [[Westminster Assembly]]. He was elected to a fellowship at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] in 1644, from which he had to resign following his marriage.

Throughout this time, Wallis had been close to the Parliamentarian party, perhaps as a result of his exposure to Holbeach at Felsted School. He rendered them great practical assistance in deciphering Royalist dispatches. The quality of cryptography at that time was mixed; despite the individual successes of mathematicians such as [[François Viète]], the principles underlying cipher design and analysis were very poorly understood. Most ciphers were ad hoc methods relying on a secret [[algorithm]], as opposed to systems based on a variable [[key (cryptography)|key]]. Wallis realised that the latter were far more secure – even describing them as "unbreakable", though he was not confident enough in this assertion to encourage revealing cryptographic algorithms. He was also concerned about the use of ciphers by foreign powers, refusing, for example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s request of 1697 to teach [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]] students about cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Kahn|title=The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing|year=1967|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|lccn=63016109|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to London – he had been made chaplain at [[St Gabriel Fenchurch]] in 1643 – Wallis joined the group of scientists that was later to evolve into the [[Royal Society]]. He was finally able to indulge his mathematical interests, mastering [[William Oughtred]]'s ''Clavis Mathematicae'' in a few weeks in 1647. He soon began to write his own treatises, dealing with a wide range of topics, which he continued for the rest of his life.

Wallis joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the [[Savilian Professor of Geometry|Savilian Chair of Geometry]] at Oxford University, where he lived until his death on 28 October 1703 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]). In 1661, he was one of twelve [[Presbyterian]] representatives at the [[Savoy Conference]].

Besides his mathematical works he wrote on [[theology]], [[logic]], [[English grammar]] and philosophy, and he was involved in devising a system for teaching a deaf boy to speak at [[Littlecote House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Find could end 350-year science dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7511446.stm|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Holder]] had earlier taught a deaf man, Alexander Popham, to speak "plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone".&lt;ref&gt;W. Holder, W. (1668). "Of an Experiment, Concerning Deafness". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' 3, pp. 665–668.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis later claimed credit for this, leading Holder to accuse Wallis of "rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls".&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', supplement, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to mathematics ==
[[File:Wallis - Opera mathematica, 1699 - 4760514 980122 3 00541.tif|thumb|''Opera mathematica'', 1699]]

Wallis made significant contributions to [[trigonometry]], [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and the analysis of [[infinite series]]. In his ''Opera Mathematica'' I (1695) he introduced the term "[[continued fraction]]".

Wallis rejected as absurd the now usual idea of a negative number as being less than nothing, but accepted the view that it is something greater than infinity. (The argument that negative numbers are greater than infinity involves the quotient &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; and considering what happens as ''x'' approaches and then crosses the point ''x'' = 0 from the positive side.) Despite this he is generally credited as the originator of the idea of the [[number line]], in which numbers are represented geometrically in a line with the negative numbers represented by lengths opposite in direction to lengths of positive numbers.&lt;ref name="Martínez2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martínez, Alberto A.|title=Negative Math: How Mathematical Rules Can Be Positively Bent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HSodlYby9MC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=9 June 2013|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12309-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical geometry===
In 1655, Wallis published a treatise on [[conic sections]] in which they were defined analytically. This was the earliest book in which these curves are considered and defined as curves of the second degree. It helped to remove some of the perceived difficulty and obscurity of [[René Descartes]]' work on [[analytic geometry]].
In the ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis popularised the symbol ∞ for infinity. He wrote, “I suppose any plane (following the ''Geometry of Indivisibles'' of Cavalieri) to be made up of an infinite number of parallel lines, or as I would prefer, of an infinite number of parallelograms of the same altitude; (let the altitude of each one of these be an infinitely small part [[1/∞]] of the whole altitude, and let the symbol ∞ denote Infinity) and the altitude of all to make up the altitude of the figure.”&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J.F. 1981. ‘’The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. (1616–1703)’’. Chelsea Publishing Co. New York, NY. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral calculus===

''Arithmetica Infinitorum'', the most important of Wallis's works, was published in 1656. In this treatise the methods of analysis of Descartes and [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] were systematised and extended, but some ideas were open to criticism. He began, after a short tract on conic sections, by developing the standard notation for powers, extending them from [[positive integers]] to [[rational numbers]]:

:&lt;math&gt; x^0 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{-1} = \frac 1 x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{-n} = \frac {1} {x^n} \text{ etc.} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2} \text{ etc.} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{x} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{p/q} = \sqrt[q]{x^p} &lt;/math&gt;

Leaving the numerous algebraic applications of this discovery, he next proceeded to find, by [[Integral|integration]], the area enclosed between the curve ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, the axis of ''x'', and any ordinate ''x'' = ''h'', and he proved that the ratio of this area to that of the parallelogram on the same base and of the same height is 1/(''m'' + 1), extending [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. He apparently assumed that the same result would be true also for the curve ''y'' = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' is any constant, and ''m'' any number positive or negative, but he discussed only the case of the parabola in which ''m'' = 2 and the hyperbola in which ''m'' = −1. In the latter case, his interpretation of the result is incorrect. He then showed that similar results may be written down for any curve of the form

: &lt;math&gt; y = \sum_{m}^{} ax^{m} &lt;/math&gt;

and hence that, if the ordinate ''y'' of a curve can be expanded in powers of ''x'', its area can be determined: thus he says that if the equation of the curve is ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ..., its area would be ''x'' + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 + ... He then applied this to the [[Numerical integration|quadrature]] of the curves ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., taken between the limits ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 1. He shows that the areas are, respectively, 1, 1/6, 1/30, 1/140, etc. He next considered curves of the form ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/m&lt;/sup&gt; and established the theorem that the area bounded by this curve and the lines ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 1 is equal to the area of the rectangle on the same base and of the same altitude as ''m'' : ''m'' + 1. This is equivalent to computing

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1x^{1/m}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

He illustrated this by the parabola, in which case ''m'' = 2. He stated, but did not prove, the corresponding result for a curve of the form ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;p/q&lt;/sup&gt;.

Wallis showed considerable ingenuity in reducing the equations of curves to the forms given above, but, as he was unacquainted with the [[binomial theorem]], he could not effect the [[quadrature of the circle]], whose equation is &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, since he was unable to expand this in powers of ''x''. He laid down, however, the principle of [[interpolation]]. Thus, as the ordinate of the circle &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Geometric mean|geometrical mean]] of the ordinates of the curves &lt;math&gt;y = (1 - x^2)^0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = (1 - x^2)^1&lt;/math&gt;, it might be supposed that, as an approximation, the area of the semicircle &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1 - x^2}\, dx&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{4} \end{matrix} \pi&lt;/math&gt; might be taken as the geometrical mean of the values of

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2)^0 \, dx\text{ and }\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2)^1 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

that is, 1 and &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{2}{3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;; this is equivalent to taking &lt;math&gt;4 \sqrt{\begin{matrix} \frac{2}{3} \end{matrix}}&lt;/math&gt; or 3.26... as the value of π. But, Wallis argued, we have in fact a series &lt;math&gt;1, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{6} \end{matrix}, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{30} \end{matrix}, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{140} \end{matrix},&lt;/math&gt;... and therefore the term interpolated between 1 and &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{6} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; ought to be chosen so as to obey the law of this series{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}. This, by an elaborate method that is not described here in detail, leads to a value for the interpolated term which is equivalent to taking
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac21\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac43\cdot\frac45\cdot\frac65\cdot\frac67\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
(which is now known as the [[Wallis product]]).

In this work also the formation and properties of [[continued fraction]]s are discussed, the subject having been brought into prominence by [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|Brouncker]]'s use of these fractions.

A few years later, in 1659, Wallis published a tract containing the solution of the problems on the [[cycloid]] which had been proposed by [[Blaise Pascal]]. In this he incidentally explained how the principles laid down in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' could be used for the rectification of algebraic curves and gave a solution of the problem to rectify (i.e., find the length of) the semicubical parabola ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ay''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which had been discovered in 1657 by his pupil [[William Neile]]. Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The [[logarithmic spiral]] had been rectified by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel. The cycloid was the next curve rectified; this was done by [[Christopher Wren]] in 1658.

Early in 1658 a similar discovery, independent of that of Neile, was made by [[van Heuraët]], and this was published by [[van Schooten]] in his edition of Descartes's ''Geometria'' in 1659. Van Heuraët's method is as follows. He supposes the curve to be referred to rectangular axes; if this be so, and if (''x'', ''y'') be the coordinates of any point on it, and ''n'' be the length of the normal{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}, and if another point whose coordinates are (''x'', η) be taken such that  η : ''h'' = ''n'' : ''y'', where ''h'' is a constant; then, if ''ds'' be the element of the length of the required curve, we have by similar triangles ''ds'' : ''dx'' = ''n'' : ''y''. Therefore, ''h ds'' = η ''dx''. Hence, if the area of the locus of the point (''x'', η) can be found, the first curve can be rectified. In this way van Heuraët effected the rectification of the curve ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but added that the rectification of the parabola ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ax'' is impossible. since it requires the quadrature of the hyperbola. The solutions given by Neile and Wallis are somewhat similar to that given by van Heuraët, though no general rule is enunciated, and the analysis is clumsy. A third method was suggested by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] in 1660, but it is inelegant and laborious.

===Collision of bodies===

The theory of the [[collision of bodies]] was propounded by the [[Royal Society]] in 1668 for the consideration of mathematicians. Wallis, [[Christopher Wren]], and [[Christian Huygens]] sent correct and similar solutions, all depending on what is now called the [[conservation of momentum]]; but, while Wren and Huygens confined their theory to perfectly elastic bodies ([[elastic collision]]), Wallis considered also imperfectly elastic bodies ([[inelastic collision]]). This was followed in 1669 by a work on [[statics]] (centres of gravity), and in 1670 by one on [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: these provide a convenient synopsis of what was then known on the subject.

===Algebra===

In 1685 Wallis published ''Algebra'', preceded by a historical account of the development of the subject, which contains a great deal of valuable information. The second edition, issued in 1693 and forming the second volume of his ''Opera'', was considerably enlarged. This algebra is noteworthy as containing the first systematic use of formulae. A given magnitude is here represented by the numerical ratio which it bears to the unit of the same kind of magnitude: thus, when Wallis wants to compare two lengths he regards each as containing so many units of length. This perhaps will be made clearer by noting that the relation between the space described in any time by a particle moving with a uniform velocity is denoted by Wallis by the formula

:''s'' = ''vt'',

where ''s'' is the number representing the ratio of the space described to the unit of length; while the previous writers would have denoted the same relation by stating what is equivalent to the proposition

:''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Geometry===
He is usually credited with the proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] using [[similar triangles]]. However, [[Thabit Ibn Qurra]] (AD 901), an Arab mathematician, had produced a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem applicable to all triangles six centuries earlier. It is a reasonable conjecture that Wallis was aware of Thabit's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.G.|last=Joseph|title=The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics|edition=2|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=0-14-027778-1|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis was also inspired by the works of Islamic mathematician Sadr al-Tusi, the son of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], particularly by al-Tusi's book written in AD 1298 on the [[parallel postulate]]. The book was based on his father's thoughts which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. After reading this, Wallis then wrote about his ideas as he developed his own thoughts about the postulate, trying to prove it also with similar triangles.&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam:A Sourcebook [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8583.html Victor J.

He found that [[Parallel postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate]] is equivalent to the one currently named  "Wallis postulate" after him. This postulate states that "On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle". This result was encompassed in a trend trying to deduce Euclid's fifth from the other four postulates which today is known to be impossible. Unlike other authors, he realised that the unbounded growth of a triangle was not guaranteed by the four first postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of Wallis's mathematical skills was his ability to do mental calculations. He slept badly and often did mental calculations as he lay awake in his bed. One night he calculated in his head the square root of a number with 53 digits. In the morning he dictated the 27-digit square root of the number, still entirely from memory. It was a feat that was considered remarkable, and [[Henry Oldenburg]], the Secretary of the Royal Society, sent a colleague to investigate how Wallis did it. It was considered important enough to merit discussion in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the Royal Society of 1685.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wallis (1685) "Two extracts of the Journal of the Phil. Soc. of Oxford; one containing a paper, communicated March 31, 1685, by the Reverend Dr. Wallis, president of that society, concerning the strength of memory when applied with due attention; … ", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''15''' :  1269-1271.

===Controversy with Hobbes===
{{details|Hobbes–Wallis controversy}}

A long-running debate between Wallis and [[Thomas Hobbes]] arose in the mid-1650s, when mathematicians criticised errors in the work ''[[De corpore]]'' by Hobbes. It continued into the 1670s, having gathered in the later claims of Hobbes on [[squaring the circle]], and the wider beliefs on both sides.

== Musical theory ==
Wallis translated into Latin works of [[Ptolemy]], Bryennius, and Porphyrius's commentary on Ptolemy.  He also published three letters to [[Henry Oldenburg]] concerning tuning. He approved of [[equal temperament]] that was being used in England's organs.&lt;ref&gt;David Damschoder and David Russell Williams, ''Music Theory from Zarlino to Schenker: A Bibliography and Guide'' (Stytvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1990), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
[[File:Wallis - Opera mathematica, 1657 - 4611280.tif|thumb|''Opera mathematica'', 1657]]His ''Institutio logicae'', published in 1687, was very popular.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wallis, John |volume=28 |page=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Grammatica linguae Anglicanae'' was a work on [[English grammar]], that remained in print well into the eighteenth century. He also published on theology.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Family==
On 14 March 1645 he married '''Susanna Glynde''' (16?? – 16 March 1687), They had three children:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10550">[[File:Jorge Luis Borges.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Borges in 1976]]
'''Jorge Luis Borges and mathematics''' concerns several modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts found in certain essays and short stories of [[Argentina|Argentinian]] author [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899-1986), including concepts such as [[set theory]], [[recursion]], [[chaos theory]], and [[infinity|infinite]] [[sequence]]s,&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{cite web|last=Martínez|first=Guillermo|title=Borges and Mathematics|url=http://logicophilosophicus.org/guillermo-martinez/borges-and-mathematics.html|date=19 February 2003|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although Borges' strongest links to mathematics are through [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory of infinite sets, outlined in "The Doctrine of Cycles" (''La doctrina de los ciclos''). Some of Borges' most popular works such as "[[The Library of Babel]]" (''La Biblioteca de Babel''), "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]" (''El Jardín de Senderos que se Bifurcan''), "[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]" (''El Aleph''), an allusion to Cantor's use of the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) to denote cardinality of transfinite sets,&lt;ref name=cosmicweb&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayles|first=N. Katherine|title=The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century|year=1984|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ey5nmCC_BcC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=hayles+the+cosmic+web&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lk0JfUXD5N&amp;sig=uDYCW2oFV9ZkPsslwhf0x6T91XA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1u5TT_7pOcPiiAKk7M20Bg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hayles%20the%20cosmic%20web&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim]]" (''El acercamiento a Almotásim'') illustrate his use of mathematics.

According to Argentinian mathematician [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], Borges at least had a knowledge of mathematics at the level of first courses in [[algebra]] and analysis at a university – covering [[logic]], [[paradox]]es, infinity, [[topology]] and [[probability theory]]. He was also aware of the contemporary debates on the foundations of mathematics.&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt; 

==Infinity and cardinality==
His 1939 essay "Avatars of the Tortoise" (''Avatares de la Tortuga'') is about infinity, and he opens by describing the book he would like to write on infinity: “five or seven years of metaphysical, theological, and mathematical training would prepare me (perhaps) for properly planning that book.”&lt;ref name=otherinquisitions&gt;"Los avatares de la tortuga", en Sur, nº 63, Buenos Aires, diciembre 1939, pp. 18-23. (Recogido en Discusión, Buenos Aires, Emecé, 1957) Original quote says: "Cinco, sietes años de aprendizaje metafísico, teológico, matemático, me capacitarían (tal vez), para planear decorosamente ese libro."&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
[[File:Illustration nested intervals.svg|300px|thumb|right|Visualizing a [[measure (mathematics)|measure zero]] set as the limit of a sequence of [[nested intervals]]. Pages in "[[The Book of Sand]]" have measure zero.]] 

In Borges' 1941 story, "The Library of Babel", the narrator declares that the collection of books of a fixed number of [[orthography|orthographic]] symbols and pages is unending.&lt;ref name=collfiction&gt;{{cite book|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|title=Collected Fictions|year=1998|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-84970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the [[permutation]]s of twenty-five orthographic symbols is finite, the library has to be [[periodic function|periodic]] and self-repeating.&lt;ref name=cosmicweb /&gt; 

In his 1975 short story "[[The Book of Sand]]" (''El Libro de Arena''), he deals with another form of infinity; one whose elements are a [[dense set]], that is, for any two elements, we can always find another between them. This concept was also used in the physical book the short-story came from, [[The Book of Sand (book)|''The Book of Sand'' book]].&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt; The narrator describes the book as having pages that are "infinitely thin", which can be interpreted either as referring to a set of [[measure (mathematics)|measure zero]], or of having [[infinitesimal]] length, in the sense of [[second order logic]].&lt;ref name=wgbloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=William Goldbloom|title=The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533457-9|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_unimaginable_mathematics_of_Borges_L.html?id=ebILwSGlUlgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1936 essay "The Doctrine of Cycles" (''La doctrina de los ciclos''),&lt;ref&gt;''La doctrina de los ciclos'', en Sur, nº 20, Buenos Aires, mayo 1936, pp. 20-29. (Recogido en Historia de la eternidad, Buenos Aires, Viau y Zona, 1936. Fechado 1934)&lt;/ref&gt; published in his essay anthology of the same year [[Historia de la eternidad]], Borges speculated about a universe with infinite time and finite mass: "The number of all the atoms that compose the world is immense but finite, and as such only capable of a finite (though also immense) number of permutations. In an infinite stretch of time, the number of possible permutations must be run through, and the universe has to repeat itself. Once again you will be born from a belly, once again your skeleton will grow, once again this same page will reach your identical hands, once again you will follow the course of all the hours of your life until that of your incredible death."&lt;ref&gt;The original quote at the beginning of the essay says "El número de todos los átomos que componen el mundo es, aunque desmesurado, finito, y sólo capaz como tal de un número finito (aunque desmesurado también) de permutaciones. En un tiempo infinito, el número de las permutaciones posibles debe ser alcanzado, y el universo tiene que repetirse. De nuevo nacerás de un vientre, de nuevo crecerá tu esqueleto, de nuevo arribará esta misma página a tus manos iguales, de nuevo cursaras todas las 
horas hasta la de tu muerte increíble."&lt;/ref&gt; As usual with many of Borges' ideas and constructions, this line of thought was received as metaphysical speculation, a language and philosophical game. Yet almost one century later theoretical physicists are crossing the same paths, this time as a possible consequence of string theory: "“Well, if the universe is really accelerating its expansion, then we know that it’s going to get infinitely large, and that things will happen over and over and over.” And if you have infinitely many tries at something, then every possible outcome is going to happen infinitely many times, no matter how unlikely it is.".&lt;ref name=jbrookman&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=John|title=The Universe: Leading Scientists Explore the Origin, Mysteries, and Future of the Cosmos|year=2014|publisher=Harper Perennial|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18730155-the-universe|isbn= 0062296086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometry and topology==
Borges in "The Library of Babel" states that "The Library is a [[sphere]] whose exact center is any [[hexagon]] and whose circumference is unattainable". The library can then be visualized as being a 3-[[manifold]], and if the only restriction is that of being locally [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], it can equally well be visualized as a topologically non-trivial manifold such as a [[torus]] or a [[Klein bottle]].&lt;ref name=wgbloch /&gt; 

In his 1951 essay "Pascal's sphere" (''La esfera de Pascal''),&lt;ref&gt;''La esfera de Pascal'', en La Nación, Buenos Aires, 14 enero 1951, 2.ª sec., p. 1. (Recogido en Otras inquisiciones, Buenos Aires, Sur, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; Borges writes about a "sphere with center everywhere and circumference nowhere". A realization of this concept can be given by a sequence of spheres with contained centres and increasingly large radii, which eventually encompasses the entire space. This can be compared to the special point in "The Aleph" by the process of [[inversion transformation|inversion]].&lt;ref name=martinez /&gt;

[[File:Schroedingers cat film.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Schrödinger's cat]]: the two outcomes can be interpreted as occurring in alternate universes with equal validity]]

==Quantum physics==
In "The Garden of Forking Paths", Borges describes a novel by the fictional [[people of China|Chinese]] scholar Ts'ui Pên, whose plot bifurcates at every point in time. The idea of the flow of time branching can be compared to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] and the notion of [[multiverse]]s present in some versions of [[string theory]].&lt;ref name=fmerrel&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrel|first=Floyd|title=Unthinking Thinking: Jorge Luis Borges, Mathematics, and the New Physics|year=1991|publisher=Purdue University Press|location=West Lafayette|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Unthinking_thinking.html?id=3IY67Ck-TFQC|isbn=1-55753-011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[infinity|infinitude]] of diverging, infinite universes in mathematical [[cosmology]] is reflected Borges' rejection of linear, absolute time.&lt;ref name=thiher&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiher|first=Allen|title=Fiction refracts science: modernist writers from Proust to Borges|year=2005|publisher=University of Missouri Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiction_refracts_science.html?id=uNZsdTLq1UUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borges' writings address the nature of [[entity]] and the possibility of infinite "realities", as in his essay "New Time Refutations" (1946).&lt;ref name=jams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Marco|first=Oscar Antonio|title=Borges, the Quantum Theory and Parallel Universes|journal=The Journal of American Science|year=2006|url=http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/0201/01-marco-0117.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaos theory==
[[Bifurcation theory]] is a  model in [[chaos theory]] of order appearing from a disordered system, and is a local theory that describes behavior of systems at local points. Borges anticipated the development of bifurcation theory in mathematics, through "The Garden of Forking Paths" in 1941. In "Garden", Borges captured the idea of a system splitting into multiple, uncorrelated states. For example, if a leaf floating in a river comes across a rock, it must flow across either side of the rock, and the two possibilities are statistically uncorrelated.&lt;ref name=chaosnorder&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayles|first=N. Katherine|title=Chaos and order: complex dynamics in literature and science|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226321436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''L'association femmes et mathématiques''' (in English: Association of Women and Mathematics), created in 1987,&lt;ref name= Noussommes1&gt;Official Association Website Nous Sommes, or About, page&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[voluntary association]] promoting women in scientific studies and research in general, and mathematics in particular. This organization currently has about 200 members, including university professors of math, math teachers, sociologists, philosophers and historians that are interested in the "woman question" in scientific domains.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

According to its mandate, its principle objectives are:

* To act for the promotion of women in the scientific sphere and more specifically mathematics.
* To encourage the presence of women in mathematical studies and more generally scientific and technical studies.
* To be a place for meetings between mathematicians and teachers of mathematics.
*Make the scientific and pedagogic community aware of the question of equality between men and women.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;
*To rally for equal representation, or parity, of women within mathematical jobs and the increase of recruitment of female math students at university.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

It specifically organizes a forum of young women mathematicians, as well as conferences on different topics related to its objectives. They hold regularly a general assembly, either in Paris or outside of the city, based on various themes.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt; It also publishes an academic journal.

The association has its headquarters at the Maison des mathématiciens at l'Institut Henri Poincaré in [[Paris]]. It participates in different initiatives with other scholarly and professional societies, in particular the [[Société Mathématique de France]](Mathematical Society of France), la Société de mathématiques appliquées et industrielles (Society of Applied and Industrial Maths), l'Association des professeurs de mathématiques de l'enseignement public (Association of Math Professors and Public Teachers) and l'Union des professeurs de spéciales.

Board of the Association for 2013:
*President: [[Laurence Broze]]&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;
*Vice-president: [[Véronique Slovacek-Chauveau]]&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

A '''linear system''' is a [[mathematical model]] of a [[system]] based on the use of a [[linear operator]].
Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the [[nonlinear]] case.
As a mathematical abstraction or idealization, linear systems find important applications in [[automatic control]] theory, [[signal processing]], and [[telecommunications]]. For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be
modeled by linear systems.

==Definition==
A general [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic system]] can be described by an operator, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, that maps an input, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to an output, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a type of [[Black box (systems)|black box]] description.  Linear systems satisfy the property of [[Superposition principle|superposition]]. Given two valid inputs 
:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
as well as their respective outputs
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = H \left \{ x_1(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = H \left \{ x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
then a linear system must satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha y_1(t) + \beta y_2(t) = H \left \{ \alpha x_1(t) + \beta x_2(t) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;
for any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- Insert picture depicting the superposition and scaling properties --&gt;

The system is then defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some arbitrary function of time, and &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the system state.  Given &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be solved for.  For example, a simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2(x)}{dt^2} = -kx&lt;/math&gt;.

If
:&lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = m \frac{d^2(x(t))}{dt^2} + kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator.  Letting &lt;math&gt;y(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can rewrite the differential equation as &lt;math&gt;H(x(t)) = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.

The behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs.  In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation.  
This mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems.
For [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems this is the basis of the [[impulse response]] or the [[frequency response]] methods (see [[LTI system theory]]), which describe a general input function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of unit [[Dirac's delta function|impulses]] or [[frequency components]].  

Typical [[differential equation]]s of linear [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] systems are well adapted to analysis using the [[Laplace transform]] in the [[continuous function|continuous]] case, and the [[Z-transform]] in the [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] case (especially in computer implementations).

Another perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s which act like [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s in the geometric sense.

A common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by [[linearization]].  This is usually done for mathematical convenience.

==Time-varying impulse response==
The '''time-varying impulse response''' ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a single [[impulse function|impulse]] applied at time ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, if the input ''x''(''t'') to a linear system is 

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \delta(t-t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where δ(''t'') represents the [[Dirac delta function]], and the corresponding response ''y''(''t'') of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) |_{t=t_2} = h(t_2,t_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the function  ''h''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following '''causality condition''' must be satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt; h(t_2,t_1)=0, t_2&lt;t_1 &lt;/math&gt;

==The convolution integral==

The output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t,t') x(t')dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t,t') x(t') dt' &lt;/math&gt;

If the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be '''time-invariant''' and h() is a function only of the time difference τ = t-t' which is zero for τ&lt;0 (namely t&lt;t'). By redefinition of h() it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,

:&lt;math&gt; y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t-t') x(t') dt' = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau  = \int_{0}^{\infty}  h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d \tau &lt;/math&gt;

Linear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called  the ''transfer function'' which is:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) =\int_0^\infty  h(t) e^{-st}\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of s. Because h(t) is zero for negative t, the integral may  equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting s = iω follows the formula for the ''frequency response function'':

:&lt;math&gt; H(i\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  h(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt &lt;/math&gt;

==Discrete time systems==
The output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{n} { h[n,m] x[m] }  = \sum_{m =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[n,m] x[m] }&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently for a time-invariant system on redefining h(),

:&lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{k =0}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] } = \sum_{k =-\infty}^{\infty} { h[k] x[n-k] }&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; k = n-m \, &lt;/math&gt;

represents the lag time between the stimulus at time ''m'' and the response at time ''n''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36719">In [[mathematical logic]], a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]] is given by a set of axioms in some
language. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in [[model theory]] and some of their properties.

==Preliminaries==

For every natural mathematical structure there is a  [[Signature (logic)|signature]] &amp;sigma;  listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their valences,  so that the object is naturally a [[model theory|&amp;sigma;-structure]].   Given a signature &amp;sigma; there is a unique first-order language  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the &amp;sigma;-structure.

There are two common ways to specify theories:
#List or describe a set of sentences in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt;, called the '''axioms''' of the theory.
#Give a set of  &amp;sigma;-structures, and define a theory to be the set of sentences in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; holding in all these models. For example, the "theory of finite fields" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.

An L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sub&gt; theory may:
*be consistent: no proof of contradiction exists;
* be satisfiable: there exists a &amp;sigma;-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the [[completeness theorem]], satisfiability is equivalent to consistency);
*be complete: for any statement, either it or its negation is provable;
*have [[quantifier elimination]];
*[[elimination of imaginaries|eliminate imaginaries]];
* be [[finitely axiomatizable]];
*be [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: There is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable;
*be recursively axiomatizable;
*be [[model complete]] or sub-model complete;
*be [[Morley's categoricity theorem|κ-categorical]]: All models of cardinality κ are isomorphic;
*be [[stable theory|stable]]  or unstable;
*be [[ω-stable]] (same as [[totally transcendental]] for countable theories);
*be [[superstable]]
*have an [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic model]];
*have a [[prime model]];
*have a [[saturated model]].

==Pure identity theories==
The signature of the pure identity theory is empty, with no functions, constants, or relations.

'''Pure identity theory''' has no (non-logical) axioms. It is decidable.

One of the few interesting properties that can be stated in the language of pure identity theory is that of being infinite.
This is given by an infinite set of axioms stating there are at least 2 elements, there are at least 3 elements, and so on:
*∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,    ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...
These axioms define the '''theory of an infinite set'''.

The opposite property of being finite cannot be stated in first-order logic for any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models: in fact any such  theory has infinite models by the [[compactness theorem]]. In general if a property can be stated by a finite number of sentences of first-order logic then the opposite property can also be stated in first-order logic, but if a property needs an infinite number of sentences then its opposite property cannot be stated in first-order logic.

Any statement of pure identity theory is equivalent to either σ(''N'') or to ¬σ(''N'') for some finite subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, where σ(''N'') is the statement that the number of elements is in ''N''. It is even possible to describe all possible theories in this language as follows. Any theory is either  the theory of all sets of cardinality in ''N'' for some ''finite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers, or the theory of all sets whose cardinality is not in ''N'', for some ''finite or infinite'' subset ''N'' of the non-negative integers. (There are no theories whose models are exactly sets of cardinality ''N'' if ''N'' is an infinite subset of the integers.) The complete theories are the theories of sets of cardinality ''n'' for some finite ''n'', and the theory of infinite sets.

One special case of this is the '''inconsistent theory''' defined by the axiom ∃''x'' ¬''x'' = ''x''. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Propositional and Predicate Calculus: A Model of Argument: A Model of Argument|first=Derek|last=Goldrei|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9781846282294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edqwSVJ9GGQC&amp;pg=PA265|page=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.

==Unary relations==
A set of unary  relations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' in some set ''I'' is called '''independent''' if for every two disjoint finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of ''I''  there is some element ''x'' such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is true for ''i'' in ''A'' and false for ''i'' in ''B''. Independence can be expressed by a set of first-order statements.

The '''theory of a countable number of independent unary relations''' is complete, but has no [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]]. It is also an example of a theory that is [[superstable]] but not [[totally transcendental]].

==Equivalence relations==
The signature of [[equivalence relation]]s has one binary infix relation symbol ~, no constants, and no functions. Equivalence relations satisfy the axioms:
*'''[[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]]''' ∀''x'' ''x''~''x'';
*'''[[Symmetric relation|Symmetry]]''' ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''~''y'' → ''y''~''x'';
*'''[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' (''x''~''y'' ∧ ''y''~''z'') → ''x''~''z''.

Some first order properties of equivalence relations are:
*~ has an infinite number of [[equivalence classes]];
*~ has exactly ''n'' equivalence classes (for any fixed positive integer ''n'');
*All equivalence classes are infinite;
*All equivalence classes have size exactly ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'').

The theory of an equivalence relation with exactly 2 infinite [[equivalence class]]es is an easy example of a theory which is ω-categorical but not categorical for any larger [[cardinal number|cardinal]].

The equivalence relation ~ should not be confused with the [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] symbol '=': if ''x''=''y'' then ''x''~''y'', but the converse is not necessarily true. Theories of equivalence relations are not all that difficult or interesting, but often give easy examples or counterexamples for various statements.

The following constructions are sometimes used to produce examples of theories with certain [[spectrum of a theory|spectra]]; in fact by applying them to a small number of explicit theories ''T'' one gets examples of complete countable theories with all possible uncountable spectra. If ''T'' is a theory in some language, we define a new theory 2&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; by adding a new binary relation to the language, and adding axioms stating that it is an equivalence relation, such that there are an infinite number of equivalence classes all of which are [[model theory|model]]s of ''T''. It is  possible to iterate this construction [[transfinite induction|transfinitely]]: given an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] α, define a new theory by adding an equivalence relation ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each β&amp;lt;α, together with axioms stating that whenever β&amp;lt;γ then each ''E&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is the union of infinitely many ''E&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence classes, and each ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' equivalence class is a model of ''T''. Informally, one can visualize models of this theory as infinitely branching trees of height α with models of ''T'' attached to all leaves.

==Orders==
The signature of orders has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbols ≤. (It is of course possible to use ≥, &amp;lt; or &amp;gt; instead as the basic relation, with the obvious minor changes to the axioms.)
We define ''x'' ≥ ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'', ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y'' as abbreviations for ''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧¬''y'' ≤ ''x'', ''y'' &amp;lt; ''x'',

Some first-order properties of orders: 
*'''Transitive''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''∧''y'' ≤ ''z'' → ''x'' ≤ ''z''
*'''Reflexive''': ∀''x'' ''x ≤ ''x''
*'''Antisymmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ∧ ''y'' ≤ ''x'' → ''x'' = ''y''
*'''Partial''': Transitive∧Reflexive∧Antisymmetric;
*'''Linear''' (or '''total'''): Partial ∧ ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''x''≤''y'' ∨ ''y''≤''x''
*'''Dense''': ∀''x'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' → ∃''y'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y'' ∧ ''y'' &amp;lt; ''z''  ("Between any 2 distinct elements there is another element")
*There is a smallest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''x'' ≤ ''y''
*There is a largest element: ∃''x'' ∀''y'' ''y'' ≤ ''x''
*Every element has an immediate successor: ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ∀''z'' ''x'' &amp;lt; ''z'' ↔ ''y'' ≤ ''z''
The theory DLO of ''dense linear orders without endpoints'' (i.e. no smallest or largest element) is complete, ω-categorical, but not categorical for any uncountable cardinal. There are 3 other very similar theories: the theory of dense linear orders with a:
* Smallest but no largest element;
* Largest but no smallest element;
* Largest and smallest element.

Being '''well ordered''' ("any non-empty subset has a minimal element") is not a first-order property; the usual definition involves quantifying over all ''subsets''.

==Lattices==
[[lattice (order)|Lattices]] can be considered either as special sorts of partially ordered sets, with a signature consisting of one binary relation symbol &amp;le;, or as algebraic structures with a signature consisting of two binary operations &amp;and; and &amp;or;. The two approaches can be related  by defining  ''a''&amp;le; ''b'' to mean ''a''&amp;and;''b''=''a''.

For two binary operations the axioms for a lattice are:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
| '''[[commutative operation|Commutative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \; a  \vee b = b \vee a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b\; a \wedge  b = b \wedge a &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[associativity|Associative]] laws:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \vee (b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \forall c\; a \wedge (b \wedge c) = (a \wedge b) \wedge c &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''[[Absorption law]]s:''' ||
| &lt;math&gt; \forall a \forall b \;a  \vee (a \wedge b) = a &lt;/math&gt; || || &lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \;a  \wedge (a \vee b) = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

For one relation &amp;le; the axioms are:
*Axioms stating &amp;le; is a partial order, as above.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; c\le a\wedge c\le b \wedge \forall d\;d\le a\wedge d\le b \rightarrow d\le c&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;and;b)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a \forall b \exist c\; a\le c\wedge b\le c \wedge \forall d\;a\le d\wedge b\le d \rightarrow c\le d&lt;/math&gt; (existence of c=a&amp;or;b)

First order properties include:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[distributive lattice]]s)
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y\forall z\;x \vee (y \wedge (x \vee z)) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[modular lattice]]s)

[[Heyting algebra]]s can be defined as lattices with certain extra first-order properties.

[[Complete lattice|Completeness]] is not a first order property of lattices.

==Graphs==
{{main|Logic of graphs}}
The signature of graphs has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbol ''R'', where ''R''(''x'',''y'') is read as "there is an edge from ''x'' to ''y''".

The axioms for the '''theory of graphs''' are
*'''Symmetric''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''R''(''x'',''y'')→ ''R''(''y'',''x'')
*'''Anti-reflexive''': ∀''x'' ¬''R''(''x'',''x'') ("no loops")

The ''theory of random graphs'' has the following extra axioms for each positive integer ''n'':
* For any two disjoint finite sets of size ''n'', there is a point joined to all points of the first set and to no points of the second set. (For each fixed ''n'', it is easy to write this statement in the language of graphs.)

The theory of random graphs is ω categorical, complete, and decidable, and its countable model is called the [[Rado graph]]. A statement in the language of graphs is true in this theory if and only if the probability that an ''n''-vertex [[random graph]] models the statement tends to 1 in the limit as ''n'' goes to infinity.

==Boolean algebras==
There are several different signatures and conventions used for '''[[Boolean algebras]]''': 
#The signature has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions ∧ and ∨ ("and" and "or"), and one unary function ¬ ("not"). This can be confusing as the functions use the same symbols as the [[propositional function]]s of first-order logic.
#In [[set theory]], a common convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +, and one unary function &amp;minus;. The three functions have the same interpretation as the functions in the first convention. Unfortunately, this convention clashes badly with the next convention:
#In algebra, the usual  convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions · and +. The function · has the same meaning as ∧, but ''a''+''b'' means ''a''∨''b''∧¬(''a''∧''b''). The reason for this is that the axioms for a Boolean algebra are then just the axioms for a ring with 1 plus ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''. Unfortunately this clashes with the standard convention in set theory given above.

The axioms are:
*The axioms for a distributive lattice (see above)
*&amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;and;¬''a'' = 0, &amp;forall;a ''a''&amp;or;¬''a'' = 1 (properties of negation)
*Some authors add the extra axiom ¬0=1, to exclude the trivial algebra with one element.

Tarski proved that the theory of Boolean algebras is decidable.

We write ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as an abbreviation for ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''x'', and atom(''x'') as an abbreviation for ¬''x'' = 0 ∧ ∀''y'' ''y''≤''x'' → ''y'' = 0 ∨ ''y'' = ''x'', read as "''x'' is an atom", in other words a non-zero element with nothing between it and 0. Here are some first-order properties of Boolean algebras:
*'''Atomic''': ∀''x'' ''x''=0 ∨ ∃''y'' ''y''≤''x'' ∧ atom(''y'')
*'''Atomless''': ∀''x'' ¬atom(''x'')
The theory of '''atomless Boolean algebras''' is ω-categorical and complete.

For any Boolean algebra ''B'', there are several invariants defined as follows. 
*the ideal ''I''(''B'') consists of elements that are the sum of an atomic and an atomless element (an element with no atoms below it).
*The quotient algebras ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''B'' are defined inductively by ''B''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=''B'', ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;/''I''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).
*The invariant ''m''(''B'') is the smallest integer such that ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial, or &amp;infin; if no such integer exists.
*If ''m''(''B'') is finite, the invariant ''n''(''B'') is the number of atoms of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; if this number is finite, or &amp;infin; if this number is infinite.
*The invariant ''l''(''B'') is 0 if ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''(''B'')&lt;/sup&gt; is atomic or if ''m''(''B'') is &amp;infin;, and 1 otherwise.

Then two Boolean algebras are elementarily equivalent if and only if their invariants ''l'', ''m'', and ''n'' are the same. In other words, the values of these invariants classify the possible completions of the theory of Boolean algebras. So the possible complete theories are:
*The trivial algebra (if this is allowed; sometimes 0&amp;ne;1 is included as an axiom.)
*The theory with ''m''=&amp;infin;
*The theories with ''m'' a natural number, ''n'' a natural number or &amp;infin;, and ''l'' = 0 or 1 (with ''l'' = 0 if ''n''=0).

==Groups==
The signature of group theory has one constant 1 (the identity), one function of arity 1
(the inverse) whose value on ''t'' is denoted by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and one function 
of arity 2, which is usually omitted from terms. For any integer ''n''. ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an abbreviation for the obvious term for the ''n''th power of ''t''.

'''[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s''' are defined by the axioms
*''Identity'': ∀''x'' 1''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''x''1 = ''x''
*''Inverse'': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' = ''1'' ∧ ''xx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''1''
*''Associative'': ∀''x''∀''y''∀''z'' (''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'')

Some properties of groups that can be defined in the first-order language of groups are:
*'''Abelian''': ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy'' = ''yx''.
*'''Torsion free''': ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1→''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 → ''x'' = 1, ...
*'''Divisible''': ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', ...
*'''Infinite''' (as in identity theory)
*'''Exponent''' ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n''): ∀''x'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
*[[Nilpotent group|Nilpotent]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')
*[[solvable group|Solvable]] of class ''n'' (for any fixed positive integer ''n'')

The theory of '''abelian groups''' is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The theory of '''finite groups''' is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory). It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is 
"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them".

The properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. More precisely, the first-order theory of all groups with one of these properties has models that do not have this property.

==Rings and fields==
The signature of (unital) rings has 2 constants 0 and 1, two binary functions + and &amp;times;, and, optionally, one unary negation function &amp;minus;.

'''[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s'''

Axioms: Addition makes the ring into an abelian group, multiplication is associative and has an identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.

'''[[Commutative ring]]s'''

The axioms for rings plus ∀''x'' ∀''y'' ''xy''=''yx''.

'''[[Field (mathematics)|Field]]s'''

The axioms for commutative rings plus ∀''x'' ¬ ''x''=0 → ∃''y'' ''xy''=1 and ¬ 1=0.   Many of the examples given here have only universal, or ''algebraic'' axioms.  The class of structures satisfying such a theory has the property of being closed under substructure.   For example, a subset of a group closed under the group actions of multiplication and inverse is again a group.  Since the signature of fields does not usually include multiplicative and additive inverse, the axioms for  inverses are not universal, and therefore a substructure of a field closed under addition and multiplication  is not always a field.   This can be remedied by adding unary inverse functions to the language.

For any positive integer ''n'' the property that all equations of degree ''n'' have a root can be expressed by a single first-order sentence:
*∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∃''x'' (...((''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''x'' +''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''+...)''x''+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

'''[[Perfect field]]s'''

The axioms for fields, plus axioms for each prime number ''p'' stating that if p 1 = 0 (i.e. the field has [[field characteristic|characteristic]] ''p''), then every field element has a ''p''th root.

'''Algebraically closed fields of characteristic ''p'''''

The axioms for fields, plus for every positive ''n'' the axiom that all polynomials of degree ''n'' have a root, plus axioms fixing the characteristic. The classical examples of complete theories. [[Category theory|Categorical]] in all uncountable cardinals. The theory ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; has a ''universal domain property'', in the sense that every structure ''N'' satisfying the universal axioms of  ''ACF''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is a substructure of a sufficiently large algebraically closed field  &lt;math&gt; M \models ACF_0 &lt;/math&gt;, and additionally any two such embeddings ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' induce an [[automorphism]] of ''M''.

'''[[Finite field]]s'''

The theory of finite fields is the set of all first-order statements that are true in all finite fields. Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the [[Chevalley–Warning theorem]], over the [[prime field]]s. The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.

'''[[Formally real field]]s'''

These are fields with the axiom 
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

'''[[Real closed field]]s'''

Axioms: *∀''x'' ∃''y'' ''x''=''yy'' ∨ ''x''+''yy''= 0.
*For every odd positive ''n'', the axiom stating that every polynomial of degree ''n'' has a root.
*For every positive ''n'', the axiom ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... ∀ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ ...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;=0∨ ... ∨''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).

The theory of real closed fields is effective and complete and therefore decidable (the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]]). The addition of further function symbols (e.g., the exponential function, the sine function) [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|may change decidability]]. 

''' ''p''-adic fields'''

{{harvtxt|Ax|Kochen|1965}} showed that the theory of ''p''-adic fields is decidable and gave a set of axioms for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Geometry==
Axioms for various systems of geometry usually use a typed language, with the different types corresponding to different geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, planes, and so on. The signature will often consist of binary incidence relations between objects of different types; for example, the relation that a point lies on a line. The signature may have more complicated relations; for example ordered geometry might have a ternary "betweenness" relation for 3 points, which says whether one lies between two others, or a "congruence" relation between 2 pairs of points.

Some examples of axiomatized systems of geometry include [[ordered geometry]], [[absolute geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]],  and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. For each of these geometries there are many different and inequivalent systems of axioms for various dimensions. Some of these axiom systems include "completeness" axioms that are not first order.

As a typical example, the axioms for projective geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines. If point and line variables are indicated by small and capital letter, and ''a'' incident to ''A'' is written as ''aA'', then one set of axioms is
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\;\lnot a=b\rightarrow \exists C\; aC\land bC &lt;/math&gt; (There is a line through any 2 distinct points ''a'',''b'' ...)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall  C\forall D\; \lnot a=b\land aC\land bC \land aD\land bD\rightarrow C=D&lt;/math&gt; (... which is unique)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a\forall b\forall c\forall d\forall e\forall G\forall H \;aH\land bH\land eH\land cG\land dG\land eG\rightarrow\exists f\exists I\exists J\;  aI\land cI\land fI\land bJ\land dJ\land fJ&lt;/math&gt; (Veblen's axiom: if ''ab'' and ''cd'' lie on intersecting lines, then so do ''ac'' and ''bd''.)
*&lt;math&gt;\forall A\exists b\exists c\exists d\; bA\land cA\land dA\land \lnot b=c\land \lnot b=d\land \lnot c=d &lt;/math&gt; (Every line has at least 3 points)

Euclid did not state all the axioms for Euclidean geometry explicitly, and the first complete list was given by Hilbert in [[Hilbert's axioms]]. This is not a first order axiomatization as one of Hilbert's axioms is a second order completeness axiom. [[Tarski's axioms]] are a first order axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Tarski showed this axiom system is complete and decidable by relating it to the complete and decidable theory of real closed fields.

==Differential algebra==
* The theory DF of [[differential field]]s.
The signature is that of fields (0, 1, +, −, ×) together with a unary function ∂, the derivation.
The axioms are those for fields together with
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial(uv) = u \,\partial v + v\, \partial u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u\forall v\,\partial (u + v) = \partial u + \partial v\ .&lt;/math&gt;
For this theory one can add the condition that the characteristic is ''p'', a prime or zero,
to get the theory DF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''differential fields of characteristic ''p'' '''(and similarly with the other theories below).

If ''K'' is a differential field then the '''field of constants''' &lt;math&gt; k = \{u \in K : \partial(u) = 0\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The theory of '''differentially perfect fields''' is the theory of differential fields together with the condition that the field of constants is perfect; in other words, for each prime ''p'' it has the axiom:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0\rightarrow \exists v\,  v^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
(There is little point in demanding that the whole field should be a [[perfect field]], because in non-zero characteristic this implies the differential is 0.)
For technical reasons to do with [[quantifier elimination]], it is sometimes more convenient to force the constant field to be perfect by adding a new symbol ''r'' to the signature with the axioms
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\partial(u)=0 \land p 1 = 0 \rightarrow r(u)^p=u&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u \,\lnot \partial(u)=0\rightarrow r(u)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
* The theory of '''[[differentially closed field]]s''' (DCF) is the theory of differentially perfect fields with axioms saying that if ''f'' and ''g'' are  [[differential polynomial]]s and the [[separant]] of ''f'' is nonzero  and ''g''≠0 and  ''f'' has order greater than that of ''g'', then there is some ''x'' in the field with ''f''(''x'')=0 and ''g''(''x'')≠0.

==Addition==
The '''theory of the natural numbers with a successor function''' has signature consisting of a constant 0 and a unary function ''S'' ("successor": ''S''(''x'') is interpreted as ''x''+1), and has axioms:
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').
The last axiom (induction) can be replaced by the axioms
*For each integer ''n''&gt;0, the axiom ∀x SSS...Sx ≠ x (with ''n'' copies of ''S'')
* ∀x &amp;not; x = 0 → ∃y Sy = x

The theory of the natural numbers with a successor function is complete and decidable, and is &amp;kappa;-categorical for uncountable &amp;kappa; but not for countable &amp;kappa;.

'''[[Presburger arithmetic]]''' is the theory of the natural numbers under addition, with signature consisting of a constant 0, a unary function ''S'', and a binary function +. It is complete and decidable. The axioms are 
# ∀x &amp;not; Sx = 0
# ∀x∀y Sx = Sy → x = y
# ∀x x + 0 = x
# ∀x∀y x + Sy = S(x + y)
#Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] with a single free variable ''x''. Then the following formula is an axiom:
:(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'')&amp;rarr;''P''(''Sx''))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').

==Arithmetic==
Many of the first order theories described above can be extended to complete recursively enumerable consistent theories. This is no longer true for most of the following theories; they can usually encode both multiplication and addition of natural numbers, and this gives them enough power to encode themselves, which implies that [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] applies and the theories can no longer be both complete and recursively enumerable (unless they are inconsistent).

The signature of a theory of arithmetic has:
*The constant 0;
*The [[unary function]], the [[successor function]], here denoted by prefix ''S'', or by prefix &amp;sigma; or postfix &amp;prime; elsewhere;
*Two [[binary function]]s, denoted by infix + and &amp;times;, called "addition" and "multiplication."
Some authors take the signature to contain a constant 1 instead of the function ''S'', then define ''S'' in the obvious way as  ''St'' = 1 + ''t''.

'''[[Robinson arithmetic]]''' (also called '''Q'''). Axioms (1) and (2) govern the distinguished element 0. (3) assures that ''S'' is an [[Injective function|injection]]. Axioms (4) and (5) are the standard recursive definition of addition; (6) and (7) do the same for multiplication.  Robinson arithmetic  can be thought of as  Peano arithmetic without induction. '''Q''' is  a weak theory for which [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] holds.
Axioms:
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; S''x'' = 0
# ∀''x'' &amp;not; ''x'' = 0 → ∃''y'' S''y'' = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' S''x'' = S''y'' → ''x'' = ''y''
# ∀''x'' ''x'' + 0 = ''x''
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' + S''y'' = S(''x'' + ''y'')
# ∀''x'' ''x'' &amp;times; 0 = 0
# ∀''x''∀''y'' ''x'' &amp;times; S''y'' = (''x'' &amp;times; ''y'') + ''x''.

'''I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is first order Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to [[Arithmetical hierarchy|Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; formulas]] (for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, ...). The theory I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by I&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a series of more and more powerful fragments of Peano arithmetic. The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 has about the same strength as  '''[[primitive recursive arithmetic]]''' (PRA).
'''[[Exponential function arithmetic]]''' (EFA) is I&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with an axiom stating that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; exists for all ''x'' and ''y'' (with the usual properties).

'''First order [[Peano arithmetic]]''', '''PA'''. The "standard" theory of arithmetic. The axioms are the axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]] above, together with the axiom scheme of induction:
* &lt;math&gt;\phi(0) \wedge (\forall x \phi(x) \rightarrow \phi(Sx)) \rightarrow (\forall x \phi(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &amp;phi; in the language of '''PA'''. &amp;phi; may contain free variables other than ''x''.
[[Kurt Gödel]]'s  1931 paper proved that '''PA''' is incomplete, and has no consistent recursively enumerable completions.

'''Complete arithmetic''' (also known as '''true arithmetic''') is the theory of the standard model of arithmetic, the natural numbers '''N'''. It is complete but does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms.

For the '''real numbers''', the situation is slightly different: The case that includes just addition and multiplication cannot encode the integers, and hence [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem|does not apply]]. [[Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|Complications]] arise when adding further function symbols (e.g., exponentiation).

==Second order arithmetic==
'''[[Second-order arithmetic]]''' can refer to a first order theory (in spite of the name) with two types of variables, thought of as varying over integers and subsets of the integers. (There is also a theory of arithmetic in second order logic that is called second order arithmetic. It has only one model, unlike the corresponding theory in first order logic, which is incomplete.) The signature will typically be the signature 0, ''S'', +, &amp;times; of arithmetic, together with a membership relation &amp;isin; between integers and subsets (though there are numerous minor variations).  The axioms are those of [[Robinson arithmetic]], together with axiom schemes of [[Mathematical induction|induction]] and [[Axiom schema of specification|comprehension]].

There are  many different subtheories of second order arithmetic that differ in which formulas are allowed in the induction and comprehension schemes. 
In order of increasing strength, five of the most common  systems
are 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{RCA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Recursive Comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{WKL}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Weak König's lemma
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ACA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical comprehension
*&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ATR}_0&lt;/math&gt;, Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion
*&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1\mbox{-}\mathsf{CA}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; comprehension
These are defined in detail in the articles on [[second order arithmetic]] and [[reverse mathematics]].

==Set theories==
The usual signature of set theory has one binary relation ∈, no constants, and no functions. Some of the theories below are "class theories" which have two sorts of object, sets and classes. There are three common ways of handling this in first-order logic:
#Use first-order logic with two types.
#Use ordinary first-order logic, but add a new unary predicate "Set", where "Set(''t'')" means informally "''t'' is a set".
#Use ordinary first-order logic, and instead of adding a new predicate to the language, treat "Set(''t'')" as an abbreviation for "∃''y'' ''t''∈''y''"

Some first order set theories include:
*Weak theories lacking [[powerset]]s:
**[[General set theory|S']]  (Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson, 1953); (finitely axiomatizable)
**[[General set theory]];
**[[Kripke–Platek set theory]]; KP;
**[[Pocket set theory]]
*[[Mac Lane set theory]] and  [[elementary topos theory]]
*[[Zermelo set theory]]; Z
*[[Ackermann set theory]];
*[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]; ZF, ZFC;
*[[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]; NBG; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Morse–Kelley set theory]]; MK;
*[[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]]; TG;
*[[New Foundations]]; (finitely axiomatizable)
*[[Scott–Potter set theory]]
*[[Positive set theory]]

Some extra first order axioms that can be added to one of these (usually ZF) include:
*[[axiom of choice]], [[axiom of dependent choice]]
*[[Generalized continuum hypothesis]]
*[[Martin's axiom]] (usually together with the negation of the continuum hypothesis), [[Martin's maximum]]
*[[diamondsuit|◊]] and [[clubsuit|♣]]
*[[Axiom of constructibility]] (V=L)
*[[proper forcing axiom]]
*[[analytic determinacy]], [[projective determinacy]], [[Axiom of determinacy]]
*Many [[list of large cardinal properties|large cardinal axioms]]

This page includes a list of cardinals with [[large cardinal]] properties. It is arranged roughly in order of the consistency strength of the axiom asserting the existence of cardinals with the given property. Existence of a cardinal number κ of a given type implies the existence of cardinals of most of the types listed above that type, and for most listed cardinal descriptions φ of lesser consistency strength, [[Von Neumann universe|''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;]] satisfies "there is an unbounded class of cardinals satisfying φ".

The following table usually arranges cardinals in order of [[equiconsistency#Consistency strength|consistency strength]], with size of the cardinal used as a tiebreaker. In a few cases (such as strongly compact cardinals) the exact consistency strength is not known and the table uses the current best guess.

* "Small" cardinals: 0, 1, 2, ..., &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0, \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;,..., &lt;math&gt;\kappa  = \aleph_{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt;, ... (see [[Aleph number]])
* [[worldly cardinal]]s
* weakly and strongly [[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]], α-[[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]], and hyper inaccessible cardinals
* weakly and strongly [[Mahlo cardinal|Mahlo]], α-[[Mahlo cardinal|Mahlo]], and hyper Mahlo cardinals.
* [[reflecting cardinal|reflecting]] cardinals
* [[weakly compact cardinal|weakly compact]] (= Π{{su|p=1|b=1}}-indescribable), [[indescribable cardinal|Π{{su|p=''m''|b=''n''}}-indescribable]], [[indescribable cardinal|totally indescribable]] cardinals
* [[unfoldable cardinal|λ-unfoldable]], [[unfoldable cardinal|unfoldable]] cardinals, [[indescribable cardinal|&amp;nu;-indescribable]] cardinals and [[shrewd cardinal|λ-shrewd]], [[shrewd cardinal|shrewd]] cardinals (not clear how these relate to each other).
* [[subtle cardinal|ethereal cardinals]], [[subtle cardinal]]s
* [[almost ineffable cardinal|almost ineffable]], [[ineffable cardinal|ineffable]], [[ineffable cardinal|''n''-ineffable]], [[ineffable cardinal|totally ineffable]] cardinals
* [[remarkable cardinal]]s
* [[Erdős cardinal|α-Erdős cardinal]]s (for [[countable]] α), [[zero sharp|0&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;]] (not a cardinal), [[iterable cardinal|γ-iterable]], [[Erdős cardinal|γ-Erdős cardinal]]s (for [[uncountable set|uncountable]] γ)
* [[almost Ramsey cardinal|almost Ramsey]], [[Jónsson cardinal|Jónsson]], [[Rowbottom cardinal|Rowbottom]], [[Ramsey cardinal|Ramsey]], [[ineffably Ramsey cardinal|ineffably Ramsey]], completely Ramsey, strongly Ramsey, super Ramsey cardinals
* [[measurable cardinal]]s,  [[zero dagger|0&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* [[strong cardinal|λ-strong]],  [[strong cardinal|strong]] cardinals, [[tall cardinal|tall]] cardinals
* [[Woodin cardinal|Woodin]], [[weakly hyper-Woodin cardinal|weakly hyper-Woodin]], [[Shelah cardinal|Shelah]], [[hyper-Woodin cardinal|hyper-Woodin]] cardinals
* [[superstrong cardinal]]s (=1-superstrong; for ''n''-superstrong for ''n''&amp;ge;2 see further down.)
* [[subcompact cardinal|subcompact]], [[strongly compact cardinal|strongly compact]] (Woodin&lt; strongly compact&amp;le;supercompact), [[supercompact cardinal|supercompact]], [[hypercompact cardinal|hypercompact]] cardinals
* [[extendible cardinal|η-extendible]], [[extendible cardinal|extendible]] cardinals
* [[Vopěnka cardinal]]s, Shelah for supercompactness, [[high jump cardinal]]s
* ''n''-[[superstrong cardinal|superstrong (''n''&amp;ge;2)]], ''n''-[[huge cardinal|almost huge]], ''n''-[[huge cardinal|super almost huge]], ''n''-[[huge cardinal|huge]], ''n''-[[huge cardinal|superhuge]] cardinals  (1-huge=huge, etc.)
* [[Wholeness axiom]], [[rank-into-rank]] (Axioms I3, I2, I1, and I0)
The following even stronger large cardinal properties are not consistent with the axiom of choice, but their existence has not yet been refuted in ZF alone (that is, without use of the [[axiom of choice]]). 
*[[Reinhardt cardinal]], [[Berkeley cardinal]]  &lt;!--

These do not really make sense, and it is not clear which should be first or last.
* [[contradiction|0=1]] is (somewhat jokingly) listed as the ultimate large cardinal axiom by some authors.
* The [[Consistency_strength#Consistency_strength|Strong]] [[Reflection principle|Reflection Principle]] of the [[Absolute Infinite]] [[Tav_(number)|Tav]] --&gt;

[[Latin letters|Latin]] and [[Greek letters]] are used in [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and other areas where mathematical notation is used as symbols for [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s, [[special function]]s, and also conventionally for [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing certain quantities. 

:Some common conventions:
* [[intensive quantity|Intensive quantities]] in [[physics]] are usually denoted with [[Lower case|minuscules]]&lt;br /&gt;while [[extensive quantity|extensive]] are denoted with [[capital letter]]s.
* Most symbols are written in [[Italic type|italic]]s.
* [[vector (geometry)|Vector]]s can be denoted in [[boldface]]. 
* Sets of [[number]]s are typically bold or [[blackboard bold]].

The '''''MAOL table book''''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''MAOL-taulukot'') is a book published by MAOL, the [[Finland|Finnish]] association for teachers of mathematical subjects and distributed by [[Otava (publisher)|Otava]]. It is a book of numeric tables to aid in studying [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] level. The book includes a list of mathematical notation and symbols, a diverse collection of formulae, and several numeric tables. The Finnish matricular examination board has accepted the book and allowed it to be used in the Finnish [[abitur]] examinations.

The colour of the cover of the book is changed with each edition of the book.

'''Math rock''' is a style of [[indie rock]]&lt;ref name=AMG&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=math-rock-ma0000012250|pure_url=yes}}|title=Math Rock Music Genre Overview|accessdate=October 23, 2016|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the late 1980s in the [[United States]], influenced by [[post-hardcore]],&lt;ref name="MathRockDOS"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/3205162-math-rock-family-tree--exploring-the-roots-of-foals |title = Math-Rock Family Tree: exploring the roots of Foals |author = Diver, Mike |date = April 24, 2008 |work = [[Drowned in Sound]] |accessdate = September 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[progressive rock]] bands such as [[King Crimson]], and 20th century [[minimal music]] composers such as [[Steve Reich]]. Math rock is characterized by complex, atypical [[rhythm]]ic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), [[counterpoint]], odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]], [[Extended chord|chords]]. It bears similarities to [[post-rock]].&lt;ref name="AMG" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Whereas most rock music uses a 4/4 [[Meter (music)|meter]] (however [[Accent (music)|accented]] or [[Syncopation|syncopated]]), math rock frequently uses non-standard [[time signature]]s such as 7/8, 11/8, or 13/8, or features constantly changing meters based on various groupings of 2 and 3. This rhythmic complexity, seen as ''[[mathematical]]'' in character by many listeners and critics, is what gives the genre its name.

The sound is usually dominated by guitars and drums as in traditional rock, and because of the complex rhythms, the drums section of math rock groups tend to be more salient than in other genres. It is commonplace to find guitarists in math rock groups using the [[tapping]] technique of guitar playing, and loop pedals are occasionally incorporated, as by the band [[Battles (band)|Battles]]. Guitars are also often played in clean tones more than in other upbeat rock songs, but some groups also use distortion.

[[Lyrics]] are generally not the focus of math rock; the voice is treated as just another sound in the mix. Often, vocals are not [[overdub]]bed, and are positioned low in the mix, as in the recording style of [[Steve Albini]], or Rolling Stones producer [[Jimmy Miller]]. Many of math rock's most famous groups are entirely [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] such as [[Don Caballero]] or [[Hella (band)|Hella]], though both have experimented with singing to varying degrees.

The term ''math rock'' has often been passed off as a joke that has developed into what some believe is a musical style. An advocate of this is [[Matt Sweeney]], singer with [[Chavez (band)|Chavez]], who themselves were often linked to the math rock scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6502-chavez/ |title = Interview: Chavez |accessdate = July 17, 2015 |publisher = Pitchfork Media |date = August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant intersect exists between math rock and [[emo]], exemplified by bands such as [[Tiny Moving Parts]]&lt;ref&gt;https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rmzmn6/a-tiny-interview-with-tiny-moving-parts&lt;/ref&gt; or [[American Football (band)|American Football]], whose sound was described as "twinkly, mathy rock, a sound that became one of the defining traits of the emo scene throughout the 2000s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Never Meant: The Complete Oral History of American Football {{!}} NOISEY|url = https://noisey.vice.com/blog/never-meant-the-complete-oral-history-of-american-football|website = NOISEY|access-date = February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
=== Early influences ===
The Canadian [[punk rock]] group [[Nomeansno]] (founded in 1979 and inactive as of 2016) have been cited by music critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14208/review|pure_url=yes}} | title=Live and Cuddly | accessdate=August 1, 2007 | publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{FV|date=May 2018}} as a "secret influence" on math rock, predating much of the genre's development by more than a decade. An even more avant-garde group of the same era, [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], featured the guitarist [[Fred Frith]] and the bassist [[Bill Laswell]]. With some influence from the rapid-fire energy of punk, Massacre's influential music used complex rhythmic characteristics. [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag's]] 1984 album ''[[My War]]'' also included unusual polyrhythms.&lt;ref name="Blush2010"&gt;{{cite book |last = Blush |first = Steven |authorlink=Steven Blush |title = American Hardcore: A Tribal History |chapter = Black Flag &amp; SST: Thirsty and miserable |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PFJjCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 |year = 2010 |publisher = [[Feral House]] |location = Los Angeles |isbn = 978-1-932595-98-7 |page = 72 |quotation =&amp;nbsp;... its seven-minute Metal dirges and Fusion-style time signatures confused many fans. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian groups ===
Bands such as [[Because of Ghosts]], [[The Sinking Citizenship]], and [[My Disco]] emerged in the early 2000s in [[Melbourne]].

=== European groups ===
The European math rock scene started in the late 90s to early 2000, including bands such as [[Adebisi Shank]] (Ireland), [[Kobong (band)|Kobong]] (Poland), [[The Redneck Manifesto (band)|The Redneck Manifesto]] (Ireland), [[Three Trapped Tigers]] and [[This Town Needs Guns]] (United Kingdom) and [[Uzeda]] (Italy). [[Foals (band)|Foals]] (England) was formed in 2005.

=== Japanese groups ===
{{Main|Japanese noise rock}}

The most significant Japanese groups include [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]], [[Zeni Geva]], [[Boredoms]], [[Aburadako]], [[Tricot (band)|Tricot]] and [[Doom (Japanese band)|Doom]]. [[Yona-Kit]] is a collaboration between Japanese and U.S. musicians. Other Japanese groups which incorporate math rock in their music include [[Ling Tosite Sigure]], [[Toe (band)|Toe]], [[Zazen Boys]], [[Lite (band)|Lite]] and [[Mouse on the Keys]]. [[Skin Graft Records]] and [[Tzadik Records]] have released Japanese math rock albums in the United States.

== Contemporary math rock ==
{{See also|List of math rock groups}}

By the turn of the 21st century, most of the later generation bands such as [[Sweep the Leg Johnny]] had disbanded and the genre had been roundly disavowed by [[List of math rock groups|most bands labeled with the "math rock" moniker]]. Bands in the late 90's and 2000s, such as [[This Town Needs Guns]] and [[American Football (band)|American Football]], began combining math rock and [[emo]], creating a much more vocally oriented sound.

In the mid-2000s, many math rock bands enjoyed renewed popularity. [[Slint]] and [[Chavez (band)|Chavez]] embarked on reunion tours, while [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] toured and released their [[Excellent Italian Greyhound|first album in seven years]]. [[Don Caballero]] reunited with a new lineup and released an album in 2006, while several of its original members joined new projects, such as the band [[Knot Feeder]].

'''Mathematical knowledge management (MKM)''' is the study of how society can effectively make use of the vast and growing literature on [[mathematics]]. It studies approaches such as [[database]]s of mathematical knowledge, automated processing of formulae and the use of [[semantic web|semantic information]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. Mathematics is particularly suited to a systematic study of automated knowledge processing due to the high degree of interconnectedness between different areas of mathematics.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = The recent surge of multiscale modeling from the smallest scale (atoms) to full system level (e.g., autos) related to solid mechanics that has now grown into an international multidisciplinary activity was birthed from an unlikely source. Since the US Department of Energy (DOE) national labs started to reduce nuclear underground tests in the mid 1980s, with the last one in 1992, the idea of simulation-based design and analysis concepts were birthed. Multiscale modeling was a key in garnering more precise and accurate predictive tools. In essence, the number of large scale systems level tests that were previously used to validate a design was reduced to nothing, thus warranting the increase in simulation results of the complex systems for design verification and validation purposes.

Essentially, the idea of filling the space of system level “tests” was then proposed to be filled by simulation results.  After the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1996 in which many countries pledged to discontinue all systems level nuclear testing, programs like the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) were birthed within the Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by the national labs within the US.  Within ASCI, the basic recognized premise was to provide more accurate and precise simulation-based design and analysis tools.  Because of the requirements for greater complexity in the simulations, parallel computing and multiscale modeling became the major challenges that needed to be addressed.  With this perspective, the idea of experiments shifted from the large scale complex tests to multiscale experiments that provided material models with validation at different length scales.  If the modeling and simulations were physically based and less empirical, then a predictive capability could be realized for other conditions. As such, various multiscale modeling methodologies were independently being created at the DOE national labs: Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  In addition, personnel from these national labs encouraged, funded, and managed academic research related to multiscale modeling.  Hence, the creation of different methodologies and computational algorithms for parallel environments gave rise to different emphases regarding multiscale modeling and the associated multiscale experiments.

The advent of parallel computing also contributed to the development of multiscale modeling.  Since more degrees of freedom could be resolved by parallel computing environments, more accurate and precise algorithmic formulations could be admitted.  This thought also drove the political leaders to encourage the simulation-based design concepts.

At LANL, LLNL, and ORNL, the multiscale modeling efforts were driven from the materials science and physics communities with a bottom-up approach.  Each had different programs that tried to unify computational efforts, materials science information, and applied mechanics algorithms with different levels of success. Multiple scientific articles were written, and the multiscale activities took different lives of their own.  At SNL, the multiscale modeling effort was an engineering top-down approach starting from continuum mechanics perspective, which was already rich with a computational paradigm. SNL tried to merge the materials science community into the continuum mechanics community to address the lower length scale issues that could help solve engineering problems in practice.

Once this management infrastructure and associated funding was in place at the various DOE institutions, different academic research projects started, initiating various satellite networks of multiscale modeling research. Technological transfer also arose into other labs within the Department of Defense and industrial research communities.

The growth of multiscale modeling in the industrial sector was primarily due to financial motivations.  From the DOE national labs perspective, the shift from large scale systems experiments mentality occurred because of the 1996 Nuclear Ban Treaty.  Once industry realized that the notions of multiscale modeling and simulation based design were invariant to the type of product and that effective multiscale simulations could in fact lead to design optimization, a paradigm shift began to occur, in  various measures within different industries, as cost savings and accuracy in product warranty estimates were rationalized.

The aforementioned DOE multiscale modeling efforts were hierarchical in nature.

==Areas of research==
In physics and chemistry, multiscale modeling is aimed to calculation of material properties or system behavior on one level using information or models from different levels. On each level particular approaches are used for description of a system. The following levels are usually distinguished: level of [[quantum mechanical model]]s (information about electrons is included), level of [[molecular dynamics]] models (information about individual atoms is included), [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] (information about atoms and/or groups of atoms is included), mesoscale or nano level (information about large groups of atoms and/or molecule positions is included), level of continuum models, level of device models. Each level addresses a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time. Multiscale modeling is particularly important in [[integrated computational materials engineering]] since it allows the prediction of material properties or system behavior based on knowledge of the process-structure-property relationships.

In [[operations research]], multiscale modeling addresses challenges for decision makers which come from multiscale phenomena across organizational, temporal and spatial scales. This theory fuses [[decision theory]] and multiscale mathematics and is referred to as [[multiscale decision-making]]. Multiscale decision-making draws upon the analogies between physical systems and complex man-made systems.

In meteorology, multiscale modeling is the modeling of interaction between weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience. The most challenging task is to model the way through which the weather systems interact as models cannot see beyond the limit of the model grid size. In other words, to run an atmospheric model that is having a grid size (very small ~ {{val|500|u=m}}) which can see each possible cloud structure for the whole globe is computationally very expensive. On the other hand, a computationally feasible [[Global climate model]] (GCM), with grid size ~ {{val|100|u=km}}, cannot see the smaller cloud systems. So we need to come to a balance point so that the model becomes computationally feasible and at the same time we do not lose much information, with the help of making some rational guesses, a process called Parametrization.

Besides the many specific applications, one area of research is methods for the accurate and efficient solution of multiscale modeling problems. The primary areas of mathematical and algorithmic development include:

*[[Analytical mechanics|Analytical modeling]]
*[[Center manifold]] and [[slow manifold]] theory
*[[Continuum mechanics|Continuum modeling]]
*[[Discrete modeling]]
*[[Network theory|Network-based modeling]]
*[[Statistical mechanics|Statistical modeling]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''Nash blowing-up''' is a process in which, roughly speaking, each [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]] is replaced by all the limiting positions of the [[tangent spaces]] at the non-singular points. Strictly speaking, if ''X'' is an [[algebraic variety]] of pure [[codimension]] ''r'' [[embedding|embedded]] in a [[smooth variety]] of dimension ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\text{Sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of its singular points and &lt;math&gt;X_\text{reg}:=X\setminus \text{Sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to define a map &lt;math&gt;\tau:X_\text{reg}\rightarrow X\times G_r^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_{r}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Grassmannian]] of ''r''-planes in ''n''-space, by &lt;math&gt;\tau(a):=(a,T_{X,a})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T_{X,a}&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent space of ''X'' at ''a''. Now, the closure of the image of this map together with the projection to ''X'' is called the Nash blowing-up of ''X''.

Although (to emphasize its geometric interpretation) an embedding was used to define the Nash embedding it is possible to prove that it doesn't depend on it. 

==Properties==

* The Nash blowing-up is locally a [[blowing up|monoidal transformation]].
* If ''X'' is a [[complete intersection]] defined by the vanishing of &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_{n-r}&lt;/math&gt; then the Nash blowing-up is the blowing-up with center given by the ideal generated by the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')-minors of the matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;\partial f_i/\partial x_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a variety over a field of characteristic zero, the Nash blowing-up is an [[isomorphism]] if and only if ''X'' is non-singular. 
* For an algebraic curve over an [[algebraically closed field]] of characteristic zero the application of Nash blowings-up leads to [[resolution of singularities|desingularization]] after a finite number of steps. 
* In characteristic ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, for the curve &lt;math&gt;y^2-x^q=0&lt;/math&gt; the Nash blowing-up is the monoidal transformation with center given by the ideal &lt;math&gt;(x^{q})&lt;/math&gt;, for ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, or &lt;math&gt;(y^2)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;q&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. Since the center is a hypersurface the blowing-up is an isomorphism. Then the two previous points are not true in positive characteristic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16192">{{about|the formal terminology in logic|causal meanings of the terms|Causality|the concepts in statistics|Sufficient statistic}}In [[logic]], '''necessity''' and '''sufficiency''' are terms used to describe a [[material conditional|conditional]] or implicational relationship between [[Statement (logic)|statements]]. For example, in the conditional statement "If P then Q", we say that "Q is '''necessary''' for P" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that "P is '''sufficient''' for Q" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proofs and Fundamentals: A First Course in Abstract Mathematics|last=Bloch|first=Ethan D.|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-7126-5|location=|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The assertion that a statement is a "necessary ''and'' sufficient" condition of another means that the former statement is true [[if and only if]] the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manktelow&gt;{{cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.

In [[ordinary English]], "necessary" and "sufficient" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.

==Definitions==

In the conditional statement, "if ''S'', then ''N''", the expression represented by ''S'' is called the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the expression represented by ''N'' is called the [[consequent]]. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, "''N'' if ''S''", "''S'' only if ''N''", "''S'' implies ''N''", "''N'' is implied by ''S''", {{math|''S'' → ''N''}} , {{math|''S'' ⇒ ''N''}}, or "''N'' whenever ''S''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above situation, we also say that ''N'' is a '''necessary''' condition for ''S''. In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent ''N'' must be true if ''S'' may at all be true (see "[[truth table]]" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent ''S'' cannot be true without ''N'' being true. For example, in order for someone to be called '''''S'''''ocrates, it is necessary for that someone to be '''''N'''''amed.

We also say that ''S'' is a '''sufficient''' condition for ''N''. Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if ''S'' is true, ''N'' must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or  be false. In common terms, "''S'' guarantees ''N''". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called '''''S'''''ocrates is sufficient to know that someone has a '''''N'''''ame.

A '''''necessary and sufficient''''' condition requires that both of the implications &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \Rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; (which can also be written as &lt;math&gt;S \Leftarrow N&lt;/math&gt;)  hold. From the first of these we see that ''S'' is a sufficient condition for ''N'', and from the second that ''S'' is a necessary condition for ''N''. This is expressed as "''S'' is necessary and sufficient for ''N'' ", "''S'' [[if and only if]] ''N'' ", or &lt;math&gt;S \Leftrightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Necessity==

[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sun being above the horizon is a necessary condition for direct sunlight; but it is not a sufficient condition, as something else may be casting a shadow, e.g., the moon in the case of an [[solar eclipse|eclipse]].]]

The assertion that ''Q'' is necessary for ''P'' is colloquially equivalent to "''P'' cannot be true unless ''Q'' is true" or "if Q is false, then P is false". By [[contraposition]], this is the same thing as "whenever ''P'' is true, so is ''Q''".

The logical relation between ''P'' and ''Q'' is expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" and denoted "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''" (''P'' [[Logical consequence|implies]] ''Q''). It may also be expressed as any of "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''Q'', if ''P''", "''Q'' whenever ''P''", and "''Q'' when ''P''". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.

;Example 1: For it to be true that "John is a bachelor", it is necessary that it be also true that he is
:# unmarried,
:# male,
:# adult,
:since to state "John is a bachelor" implies John has each of those three additional [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].

;Example 2: For the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.

;Example 3: Consider thunder, the sound caused by lightning. We say that thunder is necessary for lightning, since lightning never occurs without thunder. Whenever there's lightning, there's thunder. The thunder ''does not cause'' the lightning (since lightning causes thunder), but because lightning always comes with thunder, we say that thunder is necessary for lightning. (That is, in its formal sense, necessity doesn't imply causality.)

;Example 4: Being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the U.S. Senate.  If you are under 30 years old, then it is impossible for you to be a senator.  That is, if you are a senator, it follows that you are at least 30 years old.

;Example 5: In [[algebra]], for some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; to form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; be [[associative]].  It is also necessary that ''S'' include a special element ''e'' such that for every ''x'' in ''S'' it is the case that ''e'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''e'' both equal ''x''.  It is also necessary that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exist a corresponding element ''x'' "such that both ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' " and ''x''" &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' equal the special element ''e''.  None of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient, but the [[conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] of the three is.

==Sufficiency==

[[File:ICE 3 Fahlenbach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|That a train runs on schedule can be a sufficient condition for arriving on time (if one boards the train and it departs on time, then one will arrive on time); but it is not always a necessary condition, since there are other ways to travel (if the train does not run to time, one could still arrive on time through other means of transport).]]

If ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', then knowing ''P'' to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that ''Q'' is true; however, knowing ''P'' to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that ''Q'' is false.

The logical relation is, as before, expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" or "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''". This can also be expressed as "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''P'' implies ''Q''" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.

;Example 1: "John is a king" implies that John is male. So knowing that it is true that John is a king is sufficient to know that he is a male.

;Example 2: A number's being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even, but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary.

;Example 3: An occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder, and unambiguously recognizing it as such, justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt.

;Example 4: If the U.S. Congress passes a bill, the president's signature of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential [[veto#United States|veto]], does not mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional [[veto override|override]]).

;Example 5: That the center of a [[playing card]] should be marked with a single large spade (♠) is sufficient for the card to be an ace.  Three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a diamond (♦), heart (♥), or club (♣), respectively.  None of these conditions is necessary to the card's being an ace, but their [[disjunction]] is, since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact, exactly) one of the conditions.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==
[[File:Set intersection.svg|thumb|260 px|Being in the purple region is sufficient for being in A, but not necessary. Being in A is necessary for being in the purple region, but not sufficient. Being in A and being in B is necessary and sufficient for being in the purple region.]]

A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other.  For instance, ''being a [[mammal]]'' (''N'') is necessary but not sufficient to ''being human'' (''S''), and that a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''is rational'' (''S'') is sufficient but not necessary to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''being a [[real number]]'' (''N'') (since there are real numbers that are not rational).

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, "today is the [[Fourth of July]]" is a necessary and sufficient condition for "today is [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the [[United States]]".  Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for [[Inverse matrix|invertibility]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' is that ''M'' has a nonzero [[determinant]].

Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to one another.  For any statements ''S'' and ''N'', the assertion that "''N'' is necessary for ''S''" is equivalent to the assertion that "''S'' is sufficient for ''N''". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using "and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using "or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity.  For a third facet, identify every mathematical [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''N'' with the set ''T''(''N'') of objects, events, or statements for which ''N'' holds true; then asserting the necessity of ''N'' for ''S'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''N'') is a [[superset]] of ''T''(''S''), while asserting the sufficiency of ''S'' for ''N'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''S'') is a [[subset]] of ''T''(''N'').

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==
{{See also|Material equivalence}}

To say that ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'' is to say two things:
# that ''P'' is necessary for ''Q'',  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, and that ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  
# equivalently, it may be understood to say that ''P'' and ''Q'' is necessary for the other, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as each ''is sufficient for'' or ''implies'' the other.

One may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement "''P'' [[if and only if]] ''Q''", which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, whereas cases tell us that &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in [[graph theory]] a graph ''G'' is called [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color ''black'' or ''white'' in such a way that every edge of ''G'' has one endpoint of each color.  And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely.  A philosopher&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; might characterize this state of affairs thus: "Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in [[intension]], they have identical [[extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meanings, in this sense, are often called ''intensions'', and things designated, ''extensions''. Contexts in which extension is all that matters are, naturally, called ''extensional'', while contexts in which extension is not enough are ''intensional''. Mathematics is typically extensional throughout." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form "''P'' is true if and only if ''Q'' is true". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, the opposite is proven, &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;
# either directly, assuming ''Q'' is true and demonstrating that the Q circle is located within P, or 
# [[Proof by contrapositive|contrapositively]], that is demonstrating that stepping outside circle of P, we fall out the ''Q'': ''assuming not P, not Q results''.

This proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.

Because, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent to]] &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, if ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'', then ''Q'' is necessary and sufficient for ''P''. We can write &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q \equiv Q \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; and say that the statements "''P'' is true [[if and only if]] ''Q'', is true" and "''Q'' is true if and only if ''P'' is true" are equivalent.

[[Probability theory]] and [[statistics]] have some commonly used conventions, in addition to standard [[mathematical notation]] and [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]].

==Probability theory==
* [[Random variable]]s are usually written in [[upper case]] roman letters: ''X'', ''Y'', etc.
* Particular realizations of a random variable are written in corresponding [[lower case]] letters. For example, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; could be a [[random sample|sample]] corresponding to the random variable ''X''. A cumulative probability is formally written &lt;math&gt;P(X\le x) &lt;/math&gt; to differentiate the random variable from its realization.
* The probability is sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P} &lt;/math&gt; to distinguish it from other functions and measure ''P'' so as to avoid having to define " ''P'' is a probability" and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(X\in A) &lt;/math&gt; is short for &lt;math&gt;P(\{\omega \in\Omega: X(\omega) \in A\})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the event space and &lt;math&gt;X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable. &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt; notation is used alternatively.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cap B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability that events ''A'' and ''B'' both occur. The [[joint probability distribution]] of random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;P(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt;, while joint probability mass function or probability density function as &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and joint cumulative distribution function as &lt;math&gt;F(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cup B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability of either event ''A'' or event ''B'' occurring ("or" in this case means [[inclusive or|one or the other or both]]).
*[[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebras]] are usually written with uppercase [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; for the set of sets on which we define the probability ''P'')
*[[Probability density function]]s (pdfs) and [[probability mass function]]s are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;f_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Cumulative distribution function]]s (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Survival function]]s or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an [[overbar]] over the symbol for the cumulative:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x) =1-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or denoted as &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
*In particular, the pdf of the [[standard normal distribution]] is denoted  by &amp;phi;(''z''), and its cdf by &amp;Phi;(''z'').
*Some common operators: 
:* E[''X''] : [[expected value]] of ''X''
:* var[''X''] : [[variance]] of ''X''
:* cov[''X'', ''Y''] : [[covariance]] of ''X'' and ''Y''
* X is independent of Y is often written &lt;math&gt;X \perp Y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y&lt;/math&gt;, and X is independent of Y given W is often written 
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y \,|\, W &lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp Y \,|\, W&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''[[conditional probability]]'', is the probability of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''given'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''after'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is observed.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

==Statistics==
*Greek letters (e.g. &amp;theta;, &amp;beta;) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters (population parameters).
*A tilde (~) denotes "has the probability distribution of".
*Placing a hat, or caret,  over a true parameter denotes an [[estimator]] of it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[arithmetic mean]] of a series of values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by placing an "[[overbar]]" over the symbol, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "''x'' bar".
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] statistics are given below:
**the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;,
**the [[sample variance]] ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the [[sample standard deviation]] ''s'',
**the [[Pearson correlation coefficient|sample correlation coefficient]] ''r'',
**the sample cumulants ''k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Statistical population|population]] parameters are given below:
**the population mean ''&amp;mu;'',
**the population variance ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the population standard deviation ''&amp;sigma;'',
**the population [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation]] ''&amp;rho;'',
**the population [[cumulant]]s ''&amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*&lt;math&gt;x_{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is used for the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[order statistic]], where &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample minimum and &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample maximum from a total sample size ''n''.

==Critical values==
The &amp;alpha;-level upper [[critical value]] of a [[probability distribution]] is the value exceeded with probability &amp;alpha;, that is, the value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 &amp;minus; &amp;alpha; where ''F'' is the cumulative distribution function. There are standard notations for the  upper critical values of some commonly used distributions in statistics:
*''z''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''z''(&amp;alpha;) for the [[Standard normal distribution]]
*''t''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''t''(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;) for the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with &amp;nu; [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]
*&lt;math&gt;{\chi_{\alpha,\nu}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{\chi}^{2}(\alpha,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; for the [[chi-squared distribution]] with &amp;nu; degrees of freedom
*&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha,\nu_1,\nu_2}&lt;/math&gt; or F(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the [[F-distribution]] with &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom

==Linear algebra==
*[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] are usually denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g. '''A'''. 
*[[Column vector]]s are usually denoted by boldface lowercase letters, e.g. '''x'''.
*The [[transpose]] operator is denoted by either a superscript T (e.g. '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;) or a [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (e.g. '''A'''&amp;prime;).
*A [[row vector]] is written as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; or '''x'''&amp;prime;.

==Abbreviations==
Common abbreviations include:
*'''a.e.''' [[almost everywhere]]
*'''a.s.''' [[almost surely]]
* '''cdf''' [[cumulative distribution function]]
* '''cmf''' [[cumulative mass function]]
*'''df''' [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (also &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;)
*'''i.i.d.''' [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]]
*'''pdf''' [[probability density function]]
*'''pmf''' [[probability mass function]]

In mathematics, for example in the study of statistical properties of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], a '''null model''' is type of random object that matches one specific object in some of its features, or more generally satisfies a collection of constraints, but which is otherwise taken to be an unbiasedly random structure. The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable [[null hypothesis]] for the behavior of the system under investigation.

One null model of utility in the study of [[complex networks]] is that proposed by Newman and Girvan, consisting of a randomized version of an original graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, produced through edges being rewired at random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M.E.J|first=Newman|author2=M.Girvan |title=Finding and evaluating community structure in networks|journal=Phys. Rev. E|year=2004|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.1103/physreve.69.026113 |arxiv=cond-mat/0308217|bibcode=2004PhRvE..69b6113N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The null model is the basic concept behind the definition of [[Modularity (networks)|modularity]], a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters. In particular, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a specific community partition &lt;math&gt;\sigma:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,b\}&lt;/math&gt; (an assignment of a community-index &lt;math&gt;\sigma(v)&lt;/math&gt; (here taken as an integer from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) to each vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt; in the graph), the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from/to each pair of communities, from that expected in a graph that is completely random in all respects other than the set of degrees of each of the vertices (the [[degree sequence]]). In other words, the modularity contrasts the exhibited community structure in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with that of a null model, which in this case is the [[configuration model]] (the maximally random graph subject to a constraint on the degree of each vertex).

In [[several complex variables]], the '''Ohsawa–Takegoshi theorem''' is a fundamental result concerning the [[Holomorphic function#Several variables|holomorphic]] extension of a [[Square-integrable function|&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;]]-holomorphic function defined on a bounded [[Stein manifold]] (such as a [[pseudoconvex]] [[compact (mathematics)|compact]] set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; of dimension less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) to a domain of higher dimension, with a bound on the growth. It was discovered by [[Takeo Ohsawa]] and Kensho Takegoshi in 1987,&lt;ref name="OT1987"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01166457?LI=true | title=On the extension of L2 holomorphic functions |author1=Ohsawa, T. |author2=Takegoshi, K. | journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] | year=1987 | volume=195 | issue=2 | pages=197–204 | doi=10.1007/BF01166457}}&lt;/ref&gt; using what have been described as ''ad hoc'' methods involving twisted [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]]s, but simpler proofs have since been discovered.&lt;ref name="Siu2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-011-4293-7 | title=Section extension from hyperbolic geometry of punctured disk and holomorphic family of flat bundles | author=Siu, Y.

In mathematics, '''p-adic cohomology''' means a [[cohomology theory]] for varieties of characteristic ''p'' whose values are [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a ring of ''p''-adic integers. Examples (in roughly historical order) include:

* Serre's [[Witt vector cohomology]]
* [[Monsky–Washnitzer cohomology]]
* [[Infinitesimal cohomology]]
* [[Crystalline cohomology]]
* [[Rigid cohomology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">A '''procept''' is an amalgam of three components: a '''process''' which produces a mathematical '''object''' and a '''symbol''' which is used to represent either process or object. It derives from the work of Eddie Gray and [[David O. Tall]], and is a much used construct in [[mathematics education]] research.

The notion was first published in a paper in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051025030243/http://my.nctm.org/eresources/journal_home.asp?journal_id=1 Journal for Research in Mathematics Education] in 1994, and is part of the process-object literature. This body of literature suggests that mathematical objects are formed by encapsulating processes, that is to say that the mathematical object 3 is formed by an encapsulation of the process of counting: 1,2,3...

Gray &amp; Tall's notion of procept improved upon the existing literature by noting that [[mathematical notation]] is often ambiguous as to whether it refers to process or object. Examples of such notations are:

:&lt;math&gt;3+4&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of adding as well as the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of summing an infinite sequence, and to the outcome of the process.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x+2&lt;/math&gt; : refers to the process of mapping x to 3x+2 as well as the outcome of that process, the function f(x).

The statement that the sum of all [[positive number|positive]] [[parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] up to 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a [[square number|perfect square]]&amp;mdash;more specifically, the perfect square ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mdash;can be demonstrated by a proof without words, as shown on the right.&lt;ref name="dunham121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunham|1994|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first square is formed by 1 block; 1 is the first square. The next strip, made of white squares, shows how adding 3 more blocks makes another square: four. The next strip, made of black squares, shows how adding 5 more blocks makes the next square. This process can be continued indefinitely.

===Pythagorean theorem===
[[Image:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A proof without words for the Pythagorean theorem derived in [[Zhoubi Suanjing]].]]
The [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be proven without words as shown in the second diagram on left. The two different methods for determining the area of the large square give the relation 
: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
between the sides. This proof is more subtle than the above, but still can be considered a proof without words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelsen|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jensen's inequality===
[[Image:Jensen graph.png|thumb|right|150px|A graphical proof of Jensen's inequality.]]
[[Jensen's inequality]] can also be proven graphically, as illustrated on the third diagram. The dashed curve along the ''X'' axis is the hypothetical distribution of ''X'', while the dashed curve along the ''Y'' axis is the corresponding distribution of ''Y'' values. Note that the convex mapping ''Y''(''X'') increasingly "stretches" the distribution for increasing values of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jensen's Inequality|periodical=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=43|issue=8|year=1937|publisher=American Mathematical Society|page=527|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1937-06588-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' and the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' run a regular feature titled "Proof without words" containing, as the title suggests, proofs without words.&lt;ref name="dunham121"/&gt; The Art of Problem Solving and [[USAMTS]] websites run [[Java applet]]s illustrating proofs without words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://artofproblemsolving.com/articles/proof-without-words|publisher=Art of Problem Solving|accessdate=2015-05-28|title=Gallery of Proofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gallery of Proofs|url=http://usamts.org/Gallery/G_Gallery.php|publisher=USA Mathematical Talent Search|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)''' was an American academic [[think tank]] focused on the subject of reform in [[mathematics education]].  Directed by [[Edward G. Begle]] and financed by the [[National Science Foundation]], the group was created in the wake of the [[Sputnik crisis]] in 1958 and tasked with creating and implementing [[mathematics]] [[curriculum|curricula]] for [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], which it did until its termination in 1977.  The efforts of the SMSG yielded a reform in mathematics education known as [[New Math]] which was promulgated in a series of reports, culminating in a series published by [[Random House]] called the ''New Mathematical Library''.  In the early years, SMSG also produced a set of draft textbooks in typewritten paperback format for elementary, middle and high school students. 

Perhaps the most authoritative collection of materials from the School Mathematics Study Group is now housed in the [[Archives of American Mathematics]] in the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.

A '''statistician''' is a person who works with theoretical or applied [[statistics]]. The profession exists in both the [[private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as [[statistical consultant]]s.&lt;ref name=ONET&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-2041.00 |title=O*NET OnLine: 15-2041.00 - Statisticians  |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/careers/types-of-job |title=Royal Statistical Society StatsLife Types of Job |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the work==
According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as ''statistician'' in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local).&lt;ref name=bls&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/statisticians.htm |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor  |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2016-17 |title=Statisticians |accessdate=30 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2016, the median pay for statisticians in the United States was $80,500.&lt;ref name=bls/&gt;  Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics and data analysis in their work but have job titles other than ''statistician'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |deadurl=y |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232329/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011 |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2010-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Actuary|actuaries]], [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]], [[economist]]s, data scientists, data analysts (predictive analytics) [[financial analyst]]s, [[psychometrician]]s, [[sociologist]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[Quantitative psychology|quantitative psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2006-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001105634/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=1 October 2007 |accessdate=3 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statisticians are included with the [[profession|professions]] in various national and international occupational classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/resol08.pdf |title=International Labour Organisation (ILO) International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) ISCO-08 classification structure |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=122372&amp;CVD=122374&amp;CPV=21&amp;CST=01012011&amp;CLV=2&amp;MLV=4 |title=Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 21 - Professional occupations in natural and applied sciences |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BLS, "Overall employment is projected to grow 33% from 2016 to 2026, much faster than average for all occupations.

In the United States most employment in the field requires either a [[masters degree]] in statistics or a related field or a [[PhD]].&lt;ref name=ONET/&gt; "Typical work includes collaborating with scientists, providing mathematical modeling, simulations, designing randomized experiments and randomized sampling plans, analyzing experimental or survey results, and forecasting future events (such as sales of a product)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulletin.imstat.org/2014/10/ims-presidential-address-let-us-own-data-science/ |title=IMS Presidential Address: Let us own Data Science, 1 October 2014, News of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LindnerAttractor.webm|thumb|Delay Coordinate Embedding Attractor Reconstruction of the strange nonchaotic dynamics of the pulsating star KIC 5520878]]

In mathematics, a '''strange nonchaotic attractor''' ('''SNA''') is a form of [[attractor]] which, while converging to a limit, is [[strange attractor|strange]], because it is not [[piecewise differentiable]], and also non-[[chaos theory|chaotic]], in that its [[Lyapunov exponents]] are non-positive.&lt;ref name=alseda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/talks/SNA_Defin20070308.pdf|title=On the definition of Strange Nonchaotic Attractor|author=Lluís Alsedà|date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs were introduced as a topic of study by Grebogi et al. in 1984.&lt;ref name=alseda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Grebogi, E. Ott, S. Pelikan, and J. A. Yorke. Strange attractors that are not chaotic. Phys. D, 13(1-2):261–268, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; SNAs can be distinguished from [[periodic attractor|periodic]], [[quasiperiodic]] and [[chaotic attractor]]s using the [[0-1 test for chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1303.0169|last1= Gopal|first1= R.|title= Applicability of 0-1 Test for Strange Nonchaotic Attractors|last2=  Venkatesan|first2= A.|last3=  Lakshmanan|first3= M.|year= 2013|doi=10.1063/1.4808254|pmid= 23822488|volume=23|issue= 2|journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science|page=023123|bibcode=2013Chaos..23b3123G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically driven damped nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamics characterized by strange chaotic attractors, where strange refers  to  the  fractal  geometry of the attractor and chaotic refers to the exponential sensitivity of orbits on the attractor. Quasiperiodically driven systems forced by incommensurate frequencies are natural extensions of periodically driven ones and are phenomenologically richer. In addition to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, they can exhibit chaotic or nonchaotic motion on strange  attractors. Although quasiperiodic forcing is not necessary for strange nonchaotic  dynamics (e.g., the period doubling accumulation point of a period doubling cascade), if quasiperiodic driving is not present, strange nonchaotic attractors are typically not robust and not expected to occur naturally because they exist only when the system is carefully tuned to a precise critical parameter value.  On the other hand, it was shown in the paper of Grebogi et al. that SNA's can be robust when the system is quasiperiodically driven. The  first  experiment  to  demonstrate a robust strange nonchaotic attractor involved  the  buckling of a magnetoelastic ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies in the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, W. L. and Spano, M. L. and Savage, H. T. and Rauseo, S. N. and Heagy, J. and Ott, E, Experimental observation of a strange non chaotic attractor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65 (5), (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Strange nonchaotic attractors have been robustly observed in laboratory experiments involving magnetoelastic ribbons, electrochemical cells, electronic circuits, a neon glow discharge and most recently detected in the dynamics of the pulsating [[RR Lyrae variables]] KIC 5520878 (as obtained from the [[Kepler Space Telescope]]) which may be the first strange nonchaotic [[dynamical system]] observed in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Lindner, John F. and Kohar, Vivek and Kia, Behnam and Hippke, Michael and Learned, John G. and Ditto, William L., Strange Nonchaotic Stars, Phys.

There is also a two-fluid model which helps explain the behavior of [[superfluid]] [[helium]].  This model states that there will be two components in liquid helium below its [[lambda point]] (the temperature where superfluid forms).  These components are a normal fluid and a superfluid component.  Each liquid has a different density and together their sum makes the total density, which remains constant.  The ratio of superfluid density to the total density increases as the temperature approaches absolute zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">In [[philosophy]], the '''Weyl's tile argument''' (named after [[Hermann Weyl]]) is an argument against the notion that physical space is [[Discrete space|discrete]], or composed of a number of finite sized units (or tiles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Hermann Weyl|title=Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Sciences|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument purports to show a distance function approximating [[Pythagoras' theorem]] on a discrete space cannot be defined and, since the Pythagorean theorem has been confirmed to be approximately true in nature, physical space is not discrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amit Hagar|title=Discrete or Continuous?: The Quest for Fundamental Length in Modern Physics|isbn=978-1107062801|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/atomism.htm|title=Atomism|author=S.

McDaniel |publisher=Krmcdani.mysite.syr.edu |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While academic debate continues, counterarguments have been proposed in the literature.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/|title=Finitism in Geometry (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demonstration of Weyl's argument proceeds by constructing a rectangular tiling of the plane representing a discrete space. A discretized triangle, n units tall and n units long, can be constructed on the tiling. The hypotenuse of the resulting triangle will be n tiles long. However, by the pythagorean theorem, a corresponding triangle in a continuous space—a triangle whose height and length are n -- will have a hypotenuse measuring n√2 units long. To show that the former result does not converge to the latter for arbitrary values of n, one can examine the percent difference between the two results: {{frac|(n√2 - n)|n√2}} = 1-{{frac|1|√2}}. Since n cancels out, the two results never converge, even in the limit of large n. The argument can be constructed for more general triangles, but, in each case, the result is the same. Thus, a discrete space does not even approximate the pythagorean theorem.

In response, Kris McDaniel has argued the Weyl Tile argument depends on accepting the Size Thesis, according to which the distance between two points is given by the number of tiles between the two points. However, as McDaniel points out, the size thesis is not accepted for continuous spaces. Thus, we might have reason not to accept the size thesis for discrete spaces.

Nonetheless, if a discrete space is constructed by a rectangular tiling of the plane and the Size Thesis is accepted, the Euclidean metric will be inappropriate for measuring distances on the resulting space. Instead, the so-called [[Hamming metric]] should be utilized. Computer scientists interested in the distance between two strings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/525 |title=Hamming Distance and Error Correcting Codes |publisher=The Oxford Math Center| accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mathematical biologists interested in the distance between two genetic sequences employ the versions of the Hamming metric in each of their respective disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Martin Nowak|title=Evolutionary Dynamics: Exploring the Equations of Life|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2006|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
