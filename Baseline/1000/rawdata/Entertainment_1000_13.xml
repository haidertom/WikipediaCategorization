{{History of Berlin}}
The [[Golden Twenties]] was a vibrant period in the [[history of Berlin]], [[History of Germany|Germany]], [[History of Europe|Europe]] and the world in general. After the [[Greater Berlin Act]] the city became the third largest municipality in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=23505|title=Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin (Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany).|publisher=www.h-net.org|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experienced its heyday as a major world city. It was known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, film, higher education, government, diplomacy, industries and military affairs.

==Culture==
{{Main|Weimar culture}}
The Weimar Republic era began in the midst of several major movements in  the fine arts. [[German Expressionism]] had begun before World War I and continued to have a strong influence throughout the 1920s, although artists were increasingly likely to position themselves in opposition to expressionist tendencies as the decade went on.

A sophisticated, innovative [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including highly developed architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion. This culture was often considered to be [[decadent]] and socially disruptive by [[Right-wing politics|rightists]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

The so-called ''mystical arts'' also experienced a revival during this time-period in Berlin, with [[astrology]], the [[occult]], and [[esoteric]] religions and off-beat religious practices becoming more mainstream and acceptable to [[General public|the masses]] as they entered popular culture.

Berlin in the 1920s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote [[The Berlin Stories|a series of 'Berlin novels']], inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the time.

==Science==
The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (today ''Humboldt University of Berlin'') became a major intellectual centre in Germany, Europe, and the World. The sciences were especially favored &amp;mdash; from 1914 to 1933.

[[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921. He served as director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] in Berlin, only leaving after the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] Nazi Party rose to power.

Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] established the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of [[homosexuality]] could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum.

==Street fights==
{{Main|Weimar Republic}}

Politically, Berlin was seen as a left wing stronghold, with the Nazis calling it "the reddest city [in Europe] after Moscow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mitchell |first1=Otis C.|title=Hitler's Stormtroopers And The Attack On The German Republic, 1919-1933 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year=2008 |page=109 |ISBN=978-0-7864-3912-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nazi propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] became his party's "[[Gauleiter]]" for Berlin in the autumn of 1926 and had only been in charge a week before organizing a march through a [[Communist Party of Germany|communist]]-sympathizing area that devolved into a street riot.  The communists, who adopted the motto "Beat the fascists wherever you encounter them!" had their own paramilitary organization called the [[Roter Frontkämpferbund]] to battle the Nazis' [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA).  In February 1927 the Nazis held a meeting in the "Red" stronghold of [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]] that turned into a violent brawl. "Beer glasses, chairs and tables flew through the hall, and severely injured people were left lying covered with blood on the floor. Despite the injuries, it was a triumph for Goebbels, whose followers beat up about 200 communists and drove them from the hall."&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Klussmann (29 November 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/how-the-nazis-succeeded-in-taking-power-in-red-berlin-a-866793-2.html The Ruthless Rise of the Nazis in Berlin] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure and industrialization==

The government began printing tremendous amounts of currency to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]]; this caused staggering [[inflation]] that destroyed middle-class savings. However, economic expansion resumed after mid-decade, aided by U.S. loans. It was then that culture blossomed especially.

The heyday of Berlin began in the mid-1920s when it was the most industrialized city of [[Continental Europe|the continent]]. [[Tempelhof Airport]] was opened in 1923 and a start was made on [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] electrification from 1924 onwards. Berlin was also the second biggest [[inland harbor]] of Germany; all of this infrastructure was needed to transport and feed the over 4 million Berliners throughout the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Architecture and urban planning==
[[File:Hufeisensiedlung Tueren Details divStrassen 2011.jpg|thumb|Color variations of doors and entrances in the ''Hufeisensiedlung'' (1925-1933)]]

During the [[interwar period]] high-quality architecture was built on a large scale in Berlin for broad sections of the population, including poorer people. In particular the [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates|Berlin Modernism housing estates]] built before the beginning of [[National Socialism]] set standards worldwide and therefore have been added to the UNESCO World-heritage list in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin Modernism Housing Estates. Inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List''; German/English; Editor: Berlin Monument Authority - {{ISBN|978-3-03768-000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the economically difficult situation during the [[Weimar Republic]], housing construction, which up to that time had been mainly privately financed and profit-oriented, had found itself at a dead end. Inflation was on the up and for citizens on low incomes decent housing was becoming increasingly unaffordable.

Consequently, the search was on to find new models for state-initiated housing construction, which could then be implemented with a passion from 1920 on following the creation of [[Greater Berlin]] and the accompanying reform of local and regional government. The requirements for the type of flats to be built and the facilities they were to have were clearly defined, and the city was divided into different building zones. Following some basic ideas of the [[Garden city movement]] two- to three-storey housing estates that were well integrated into the landscape of the suburbs of the city were planned. The first large estate of this type with more than 2,000 residential units was the so-called [[Hufeisensiedlung ("Horseshoe Estate")|''Hufeisensiedlung'' (Horseshoe Estate)]] designed by [[Bruno Taut]] in Berlin, which introduced a new type of high quality housing and became a prominent example for the use of colors in architecture.

==Reputation for decadence==
Prostitution rose in Berlin and elsewhere in the areas of Europe left ravaged by World War I. This means of survival for desperate women, and sometimes men, became normalized to a degree in the 1920s. During the war, venereal diseases such as [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] spread at a rate that warranted government attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=[[Feral House]]|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers at the front contracted these diseases from prostitutes, so the German army responded by granting approval to certain brothels that were inspected by their own medical doctors, and soldiers were rationed coupon books for sexual services at these establishments.&lt;ref name="Gordon17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexual]] behaviour was also documented among soldiers at the front. Soldiers returning to Berlin at the end of the War had a different attitude towards their own sexual behaviour than they had a few years previously.&lt;ref name="Gordon17"/&gt; Prostitution was frowned on by respectable Berliners, but it continued to the point of becoming entrenched in the city's underground economy and culture. First women with no other means of support turned to the trade, then youths of both genders.

Crime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called ''[[Ringvereine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially "[[lust murder]]s" or ''Lustmord''. Publishers met this demand with inexpensive criminal novels called ''Krimi'', which like the [[film noir]] of the era (such as the classic ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''), explored methods of scientific detection and psychosexual analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the new tolerance for behaviour that was technically still illegal, and viewed by a large part of society as immoral, there were other developments in Berlin culture that shocked many visitors to the city. Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of [[homosexual]] venues for men and for [[lesbians]]; sometimes [[transvestites]] of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a [[transvestite]] clientele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also several nudist venues. Berlin also had a museum of sexuality during the Weimar period, at Dr. [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft|Institute of Sexology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=256–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were nearly all closed when the Nazi regime became a dictatorship in 1933.

Artists in Berlin became fused with the city's underground culture as the borders between cabaret and legitimate theatre blurred. [[Anita Berber]], a dancer and actress, became notorious throughout the city and beyond for her erotic performances (as well as her cocaine addiction and erratic behaviour). She was painted by [[Otto Dix]], and socialized in the same circles as [[Klaus Mann]].

==Life==

1920s Berlin was a city of many social contrasts. While a large part of the population continued to struggle with high unemployment and deprivations in the aftermath of World War I, the upper class of society, and a growing middle class, gradually rediscovered prosperity and turned Berlin into a cosmopolitan city.

==Cinema==

Cinema in Weimar culture did not shy away from controversial topics, but dealt with them explicitly. ''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929) directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] and starring [[Louise Brooks]], deals with a young woman who is thrown out of her home after having an illegitimate child, and is then forced to become a prostitute to survive. This trend of dealing frankly with provocative material in cinema began immediately after the end of the War. In 1919, [[Richard Oswald]] directed and released two films, that met with press controversy and action from police vice investigators and government censors. ''Prostitution'' dealt with women forced into "[[Sexual slavery|white slavery]]", while ''[[Different from the Others]]'' dealt with a [[homosexual]] man's conflict between his sexuality and social expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=1-932595-12-0|pages=55–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, similar material met with little, if any opposition when it was released in Berlin theatres. [[William Dieterle]]'s ''[[Sex in Chains]]'' (1928), and Pabst's ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) deal with [[homosexuality]] among men and women, respectively, and were not censored. [[Homosexuality]] was also present more tangentially in other films from the period.

[[File:Antoine Watteau - Actors from the Comédie Française - WGA25475.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], {{Circa|1720}}.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who portrays a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a performance (also '''actress'''; [[#The term actress|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such" (Elam 1980, 110).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the [[theatre]] or in modern mediums such as [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]]. The analogous Greek term is {{wikt-lang|grc|ὑποκριτής|italic=yes}} ({{grc-transl|ὑποκριτής}}), literally "one who answers".&lt;ref name="hypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/actor?q=actor|title=Definition of actor}}''Hypokrites'' (related to our word for [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]]) also means, less often, "to answer" the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term ''hypocrisis'' ([[acting]]) (1994, 257, 265–267).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of [[acting]]—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental [[performance art]].

Formerly, in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], and the time of [[William Shakespeare]], only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/narrativelyricdrama.htm|title=narrative, lyric, drama|last=Neziroski |first=Lirim|year=2003|work=Theories of Media :: Keywords Glossary :: multimedia|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=For example, until the late 1600s, audiences were opposed to seeing women on stage, because of the belief stage performance reduced them to the status of showgirls and prostitutes. Even Shakespeare's plays were performed by boys dressed in drag.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-sj.org/pdfs/St-Dusinberre-web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Boys Becoming Women in Shakespeare’s Plays|author=JULIET DUSINBERRE|website=S-sj.org\accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term actress==
After 1660 in [[Kingdom of England|England]], when women first started to appear on stage, the terms ''actor'' or ''actress'' were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French {{wikt-lang|fr|actrice}}, ''actress'' became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The [[etymology]] is a simple derivation from ''actor'' with {{Wikt-lang|en|-ess}} added.&lt;ref name="OED2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=3|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=actress, n.|quote=Although ''actor'' refers to a person who acts regardless of gender, where this term "is increasingly preferred", actress remains in general use; actor is increasingly preferred for performers of both sexes as a gender-neutral term.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, ''actors'' is preferred.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/sep/25/readers-editor-actor-or-actress|title=The readers' editor on... Actor or actress?|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Actor'' is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.

Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the [[post-war]] period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed.&lt;ref name="De GayGoodman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Lizbeth|authorlink1=Lizbeth Goodman|last2=Holledge|first2=Julie|title=The Routledge reader in gender and performance|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-16583-0|pages=8; 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated "Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The guide's authors stated that "actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men)." (See ''[[male as norm]]''). "As [[Whoopi Goldberg]] put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The UK performers' union [[Equity (British trade union)|Equity]] has no policy on the use of "actor" or "actress". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the "...subject divides the profession".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Actress" remains the common term used in major [[acting]] awards given to female recipients&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/18/entertainment/ca-actress18|title=From actor to actress and back again|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=18 January 2009 |work=Entertainment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=It would be several decades before the word "actress" appeared – 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word "actor" was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding "player."}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]).

With regard to the [[cinema of the United States]], the gender-neutral term "player" was common in film in the [[silent film]] era and the early days of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed [[archaism|archaic]]. However, "player" remains in use in the [[theatre]], often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the [[American Players Theatre|American Players]], the [[East West Players]], etc. Also, actors in [[improvisational theatre]] may be referred to as "players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spolin|first1=Viola|title=Improvisation for the Theater: A Handbook of Teaching and Directing Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Northwestern Univ Press|location=Evanston, Ill|ISBN=0810140004|pages=Introduction to the 3rd Edition|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improvisation-for-the-theater-a-handbook-of-teaching-and-directing-techniques/oclc/41176682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped onto the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in [[song]], dance, and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. The exclusively male actors in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] performed in three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt; Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]].

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and [[pagan]]. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. The [[Feast of Fools]] encouraged the development of comedy. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] often contained [[comedy]], with actors playing [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.

There were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.

[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the [[mystery plays]], "[[morality play]]s", and the "university drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan stage]].

The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when [[Puritan]] opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.

===19th century===
[[File:Henry Irving Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|Henry Irving in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', 1874.]]

In the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wilmeth, Don B. |author2=Bigsby, C.W.E. | title=The Cambridge history of American theatre | year=1998 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-0-521-65179-0 | pages=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite "stars". A new role emerged for the [[actor-manager]]s, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing.&lt;ref&gt;James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian era'' (2004) 1:2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. [[Henry Irving]] (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.&lt;ref&gt;George Rowell, ''Theatre in the Age of Irving'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22Xp03gBd-MC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:The_Shubert_Theatre00.jpg|border|right|frameless]]
By the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as [[Stage management|stage managers]] and later [[theatre director]]s emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], [[Edward Laurillard]], and especially [[The Shubert Organization]]. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.&lt;ref&gt;Foster Hirsch, ''The Boys from Syracuse: The Shuberts' Theatrical Empire'' (Cooper Square Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|List of acting techniques}}
* [[Classical acting]] is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. 
* In [[Stanislavski's system]], also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the "truth" of the character they portray. Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character, finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character.
* [[Method acting]] is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of [[Stella Adler]] and [[Sanford Meisner]], but these are not considered "method acting".&lt;ref&gt;Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) [https://tribecafilminstitute.org/blog/detail/what_it_means_to_be_method What It Means To Be ‘Method’]. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meisner technique]] requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system.

==As opposite sex==
Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_52_fri_04.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 4 - Woman's Hour -Women Actors in Ancient Rome|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in [[Venice]]. In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"/&gt;

When an eighteen-year [[Puritan]] prohibition of [[Restoration drama|drama]] was lifted after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. [[Margaret Hughes]] is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1534673,00.html |title=Smallweed |last=Smallweed |date=23 July 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote="Whereas women's parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women ... we do permit and give leave for the time to come that all women's parts be acted by women," Charles II ordained in 1662. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the first actress to exploit this new freedom was Margaret Hughes, as Desdemona in Othello on December 8, 1660. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422150043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0%2C%2C1534673%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition ended during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/10/18/103638994.pdf |title=Women as actresses |date=18 October 1885 |work=Notes and Queries |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote=There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage.

"The Restoration Actress". In Owen, Susan J. ''A companion to restoration drama'', pg. 73, (1. publ. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631219231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term ''actress'' was in 1608 according to the [[OED]] and is ascribed to [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]]. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often [[courtesans]] and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting "stars", most notably [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Studies in hysteria’: actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], ''[[onnagata]]'', men taking on female roles, were used in ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the [[Edo period]]. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] drama involve women playing all roles.

In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of [[Peter Pan]] is traditionally played by a woman, as are most [[principal boy]]s in British [[pantomime]]. [[Opera]] has several "[[breeches role]]s" traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s. Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, [[Stina Ekblad]] played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'', and [[Linda Hunt]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Billy Kwan in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. In 2007, [[Cate Blanchett]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 1960s, in ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in [[comic theatre]] and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt [[cross-dressing]], such as [[Francis Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The movie ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' stars [[Jack Gilford]] dressing as a young bride. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the [[Carry On films]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] have each appeared in a hit comedy film (''[[Tootsie]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.

Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', or [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. In ''[[It's Pat: The Movie]]'', filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]] and Chris (played by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Dave Foley]]). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.

A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' was played by [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 original film]], [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], and [[John Travolta]] in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 movie musical]]. [[Felicity Huffman]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing Bree Osbourne (a [[male-to-female transsexual]]) in 2005's ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''.

==Types==
Actors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.

===In theatre===
To act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as "Stage Left" and "Stage Right". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions "Upstage" (away from the audience) and "Downstage" (towards the audience)&lt;ref name="sft.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title= Industry Tips |url=http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326100456/http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is "...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

Some theater actors need to learn [[stage combat]], which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by [[fight director]]s, who help them learn the [[choreography|choreographed sequence]] of fight actions.
&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

===In film===
====Silent films====
From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were [[silent film]]s. Silent film actors emphasized [[body language]] and [[facial expression]], so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or [[camp (style)|campy]]. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. [[Vaudeville]] theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=American Film: A History|date=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97922-0|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pervading presence of [[stage actor]]s in film was the cause of this outburst from director [[Marshall Neilan]] in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures." In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.{{sfn|brownlow|1968|pages=344-353}}

Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as [[D W Griffith]], cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary [[close up]] shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company [[Biograph Studios]], became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/movies-flicks-film/film-acting-vs-theater-acting.html|title=Movies and Film|publisher=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian Gish]] has been called film's "first true actress" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between [[Stage acting|stage]] and [[screen acting]]. Directors such as [[Albert Capellani]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]] began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', were still being released. {{sfn|Brownlow|1968|pages=344–353}}

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the [[Weimar Republic]], "including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Silent Cinema|last = Kaes|first = Anton|date = 1990|journal = Monatshefte|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advent of sound in film====
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/auditions-for-film.html|title=Auditions for Film: Movie Acting Tips and Techniques|website=Ace-your-audition.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their "mark." This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on [[screen test]]s. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.

Unlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater." "The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt; Some theatre stars "...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully ([[Laurence Olivier]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Julie Andrews]], for instance), others have not..."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

===In television===
"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to learn to use lav mics ([[Lavaliere microphone]]s).&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to understand the concept of "frame". "The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt;
Within the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a ''series regular''—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in ''recurring'' roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A ''co-star'' role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A ''guest star'' is a larger role than a ''co-star'' role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.

===In radio===
[[File:Opname van een hoorspel Recording a radio play.jpg|thumb|Recording a radio play in the Netherlands (1949; [[Spaarnestad Photo]]).]]
Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic [[performance]], broadcast on [[radio]] or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio [[drama]] depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Crook: [http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf ''Radio drama. Theory and practice''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701103558/http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf |date=July 1, 2014 }}. London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR ([[old-time radio]]) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as [[Internet Archive]].

{{as of|2011}}, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or [[podcast]]s of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the [[BBC]] produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]]. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms "audio drama"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the entry to ''Hörspiel'' e.g. in: [http://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/H%C3%B6rspiel.html dict.cc – Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch]&lt;/ref&gt; or "audio theatre" are sometimes used synonymously with "radio drama" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on [[CD]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[webcast]]s and conventional broadcast radio.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | author = Newman, Barry |date = 2010-02-25 | title = Return With Us to the Thrilling Days Of Yesteryear — Via the Internet  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704240004575085313479028540 | publisher = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thark-Aldwych.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Aldwych company in ''Thark'' (1927). From left: [[Mary Brough]], [[Ralph Lynn]], [[Winifred Shotter]], [[Robertson Hare]], [[Tom Walls]], [[Ethel Coleridge]] and [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]]]] 
The '''Aldwych farces''' were a series of twelve stage [[farce]]s presented at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London, nearly continuously from 1923 to 1933. All but three of them were written by [[Ben Travers]]. They incorporate and develop British low comedy styles, combined with clever word-play. The plays were presented by the actor-manager [[Tom Walls]] and starred Walls and [[Ralph Lynn]], supported by a regular company that included [[Robertson Hare]], [[Mary Brough]], [[Winifred Shotter]], [[Ethel Coleridge]] and [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]]. 

The farces were so popular that touring companies were sent to present them in the British provinces.  Most of the Aldwych farces were adapted for film in the 1930s, starring the original stage casts as far as possible. The plays were later seen in television versions, and some enjoyed revivals.

==History==
[[Leslie Henson]] and [[Tom Walls]] co-produced the farce ''[[Tons of Money (play)|Tons of Money]]'' in 1922 at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]]. This was a great popular success, running for nearly two years, and they collaborated again, moving to the Aldwych Theatre. Walls secured a cheap, long-term lease on the theatre, which had fallen so far out of fashion with playgoers that it had been used as a [[YMCA]] hostel during the First World War.&lt;ref name=prog&gt;Programme booklet for ''Plunder'', [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], March 1976, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Aldwych Theatre 3.jpg|left|thumb|The Aldwych Theatre today]]
The first in the Aldwych farce series was ''[[It Pays to Advertise]]'', which ran for nearly 600 performances.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Mr. Ralph Lynn", ''[[The Times]]'', 10 August 1962, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Ben Travers]]'s first play, ''The Dippers'', based on his 1920 novel of the same name, was produced and directed by [[Charles Hawtrey (19th century actor)|Sir Charles Hawtrey]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dippers", ''Western Daily Press'', 24 May 1922, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It became a success on tour from 1921 and in another London theatre in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Travers, Master of Farce, Bows Out", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 19 December 1980, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Grossmith]] had acquired the rights to Travers's farce ''[[A Cuckoo in the Nest]]'' and sold them to Walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/92341 Ben Travers], British Film Institute, accessed 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It took Travers some time to establish a satisfactory working relationship with Walls, whom he found difficult as an [[actor-manager]], and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. In the early days he also had reservations about the other star of the company, [[Ralph Lynn]], who initially ad-libbed too much for the author's taste.&lt;ref&gt;Travers noted that the ad-libbing diminished as he came to anticipate and include in his scripts "the sort of thing Ralph himself would have said in the circumstances". Travers, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Travers built on each play, and the characterisations in the earlier plays, in writing the next farce for the company; and even Walls's calls to the stage manager for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.&lt;ref name=Selective&gt;Smith, pp. 50–69&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aldwych farces also featured a regular team of supporting actors: [[Robertson Hare]] as a figure of put-upon respectability; [[Mary Brough]] in eccentric old lady roles; [[Ethel Coleridge]] as the severe voice of authority; the saturnine [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]] as the "heavy"; and first [[Yvonne Arnaud]], then [[Winifred Shotter]], as the sprightly young female lead.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The plays generally revolved around a series of preposterous incidents involving a misunderstanding, borrowed clothes and lost trousers, involving the worldly Walls character, the innocent yet cheeky Lynn, the hapless Hare, the beefy, domineering Brough, the lean, domineering Coleridge and the pretty and slightly spicy Shotter, all played with earnest seriousness.&lt;ref name=Selective/&gt; The scripts incorporated and developed British [[low comedy]] styles, particularly "silly-asses, henpecked husbands, battleaxe mothers-in-law and lots of innocent misunderstandings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm Archive: "Tom Walls (1883 – 1949)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916142827/http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm |date=16 September 2012 }}, British Pictures.com, accessed 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The farces proved popular, and touring casts were regularly sent to the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Local and District News", ''Western Gazette'', 15 August 1930, pp. 4–5; and "Aldwych Farce at the Repertory", ''Western Morning News'', 13 May 1933, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some touring players, such as William Daunt (1893–1938) who played the Ralph Lynn roles, made considerable personal successes in the 1920s playing Aldwych farces in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Prince's Theatre: Rookery Nook", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 14 December 1926, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn's younger brother Hastings Lynn, played his brother's roles in successful productions in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;"Criterion – A Cuckoo In The Nest", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 31 December 1927, p. 7; "Rookery Nook", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 21 April 1928, p. 12; "Criterion – Thark", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 June 1928, p. 10; and "Stage Jottings", ''[[Auckland Star]]'', Volume LIX, Issue 201, 25 August 1928, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among the up-and-coming performers who appeared in Aldwych farces before becoming famous were [[Roger Livesey]],&lt;ref&gt;"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1925, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margot Grahame]],&lt;ref name= anlt&gt;"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'' , 19 February 1930, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norma Varden]].&lt;ref name=anlt/&gt;

After five years of extraordinary success, Walls's business partnership with Henson ended in September 1927 during the run of ''Thark'', and from October the Aldwych farces were presented by the firm of Tom Walls and Reginald Highley Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatres", ''The Times'', 28 September 1927, p. 12; and 3 October 1927, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, Walls was losing interest in the theatre, turning his attention to the cinema. He did not appear in the last three of the twelve Aldwych farces, which had disappointing runs. The last of them, ''[[A Bit of a Test]]'' in 1933, ran for 142 performances, compared with runs of more than 400 performances for some of the earlier productions.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 1952, three years after Walls's death, Lynn and Hare starred at the Aldwych in a new Travers farce, ''[[Wild Horses (play)|Wild Horses]]''. It ran from 6 November 1952 to 11 April 1953.&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 3 November 1952, p. 9, and 27 March 1953, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and early 1960s, a similar hit series of farces began at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] and came to be known as [[Whitehall farces]].&lt;ref name=Selective/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict.

[[File:Winifred Shotter 01.JPG|thumb|right|upright| [[Winifred Shotter]], leading lady in eight of the original farces and five of the filmed versions]]
Most of the farces, as well as some other works by Travers, were filmed during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Travers1&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/92341?view=credit "Ben Travers"], British Film Institute, accessed 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 101–02&lt;/ref&gt; The films featured many of the actors who had starred in the plays; Walls directed all the films except for ''[[Just My Luck (1933 film)|Just My Luck]]'' and ''[[Marry the Girl (1935 film)|Marry the Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b9f456646 "Tom Walls"], British Film Institute, accessed 1 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The films introduced the farces to cinema audiences and were produced by a number of film distributors including the [[British &amp; Dominions Film Corporation]], [[Gaumont-British Picture Corporation]] and [[Gainsborough Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/11700?view=credit Aldwych farce filmography], British Film Institute, accessed 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

A '''beat''' is the timing and movement of a film or play. In the context of a [[screenplay]], it usually represents a pause in dialogue. In the context of the timing of a film, a beat refers to an event, decision, or discovery that alters the way the [[protagonist]] pursues his or her goal.

==Beats as pacing elements==
Beats are specific, measured, and spaced to create a pace that moves the progress of the story forward. Audiences feel uneven or erratic beats. Uneven beats are the most forgettable or sometimes tedious parts of a film. Erratic beats jolt the audience unnecessarily. Every cinematic [[genre]] has a beat that is specific to its development. [[Action film]] has significantly more beats (usually events); [[Drama film|drama]] has fewer beats (usually protagonist decisions or discovery).  Between each beat a [[Sequence (filming)|sequence]] occurs. This sequence is often a series of scenes that relates to the last beat and leads up to the next beat.

In most American films the beat falls approximately every five minutes.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Following is a beat example from ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'':

*At 25 minutes: Andy talks to Red and asks for rock hammer. - Decision
*At 30 minutes: Andy gets rock hammer. - Event
*At 35 minutes: Andy risks his life to offer financial advice to Mr. Hadley. - Decision
*At 40 minutes: Andy notes ease of carving his name in the wall. - Discovery

After each beat listed above, a significant series of results takes place in the form of the sequence, but what most people remember are the beats, the moment something takes place with the protagonist.

==Beats in a screenplay==
Stories are divided into Acts, Acts into Sequences, Sequences into Scenes, and Scenes into Beats. Robert McKee uses the word "beat" differently than it is described above.  He describes the Beat as "the smallest element of structure...(Not to be confused with...an indication...meaning 'short pause')".  He defines a Beat as:  "an exchange of behavior in action/reaction.  Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene."  Specifically, a scene will contain multiple beats, the clashes in the conflict, which build a scene to eventually turn the values of a character's life, called a "Story Event".&lt;ref&gt;McKee, pgs 35-38&lt;/ref&gt;  He further describes beats as "distinctively different behaviors, . . . clear changes of action/reaction." &lt;ref&gt;Id. at 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the park==
The park is located in Skoromoshnaya [[gully]], which was the meeting place for workers of [[Yuzovsky metallurgical plant]] and the nearby [[coal mines]] in the 19th century. A [[travelling circus]] stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a  park, and in September 1932  10 000 [[Komsomol]] members and the city [[pioneer movement|pioneers]] started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.
In 1933 the alleys were established lined with [[chestnut tree]]s, [[lime tree]]s and [[Populus|poplar]]s. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. [[Amusement rides]] started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park "Medium Ponds", landscape park "Urban forest" and the "Upper" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the [[parterre]], which is the basis of the composition. The [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]] is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which [[pavilions]] were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of [[columns]] with [[cornices]]; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of [[tree]] and [[Shrub|shrub species]], and the 1955 edition "Donbass Parks" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk [[journalists]] established "Alley of Journalists". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, "Donetskproekt" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and [[rosary]] with variety of roses was made.

==Sculptures==
The sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of [[Joseph Stalin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/167|title=Парк культуры имени отдыха (товарища Щербакова) - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands.  In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball.  Stadium "Shakhtar" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/stalino/142|title=Архитектура довоенного Сталино - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a [[jar]] was placed on the banking of the "First" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the "Good Angel of Peace" was established in the Park as international symbol of [[patronage]]. On the statue basis the names of famous [[krainians|Ukrainian]] [[Patrón|patrons]] are carved: [[Nickolay Tereshchenko]], [[Bogdan Khanenko]], [[Vasiliy Tarnovskiy]], [[Rinat Akhmetov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html Остров&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131552/http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/ukraina/2008/09/01/519234.html|title=В Донецке русские художники золотом написали имя Ахметова|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/daily/130808/51296/ В парке им.

==Fountains==
The fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a [[parapet]]. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331030957/http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Children's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The [[train]] consisted of two coupled together [[trams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzd-ussr.ru/towns/donezk/|title=Донецк. Детская железная дорога|website=www.dzd-ussr.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the [[World War II]] outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; "Green" summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a [[Performance surface|dance floor]], a [[restaurant]], [[parachute]] tower (existed until 1970), reading, [[chess]] and [[checkers]] pavilions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Dramaturgy''' is the study of [[drama]]tic composition and the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work  ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'' (1767–69) by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dramatist]]s combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a [[dramaturge]], to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as "adapting a story to actable form." Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and [[Dramatic structure|structure]]. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current [[Zeitgeist]] through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'', and ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'') in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as "dramaturge". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘"dramatic judge" ("dramatischer Richter") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. &amp; BERGHAHN, K. L. 1981. Hamburgische Dramaturgie, Stuttgart, Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled ''Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).'' These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171026/dramaturgy?anchor=ref666078 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lessing's ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'' (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and ''Laokoon'' &lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. 1766. Laokoon, Berlin, C. F. Vosst&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel’s "Aesthetics" (written 1835–1838),&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL, G. W. F. &amp; KNOX, T. M. 1975. Aesthetics : lectures on fine art, Oxford, Clarendon Presst&lt;/ref&gt; many authors, including  Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 18. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschelverlag Berlin; 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 19. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschel Verlag; 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book ''The Technique of the Drama'',&lt;ref&gt;FREYTAG, G. Technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art; an authorized translation from the 6th German ed. by Elias J. MacEwan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the  first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. ''The Technique of Play Writing'' by Charlton Andrews, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, C. 1915. The Technique of Play Writing, Springfield, Mass. : The Home correspondence schoolt&lt;/ref&gt; refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

Another important work in the Western theatrical tradition is ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by [[Aristotle]] (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes [[tragedy]]. Aristotle considers ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among [[Character (arts)|character]], action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his "rules" are referred to today as "Aristotelian drama". In ''Poetics'', Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as [[anagnorisis]] and [[catharsis]].

''Poetics'' is the earliest surviving [[Western civilization|Western]] work of [[dramatic theory]]. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] work ''Natya Shastra'' (''The Art of Theatre''), written around [[Anno Dommini|500 BCE to 500 CE]], which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director''. University of Melbourne: Melbourne. p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry McCabe. ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument Against Contemporary Theatre''. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a  director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of [[Jonathan Larson]], the author of the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of ''Rent'' and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway hit]], the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of ''[[Angels in America]]'' go to playwright [[Tony Kushner]]'s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of ''Rent'' and that she was not entitled to royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in2/everythingisrent/articles/americantheatre5.html Scott. T. Cummings, ''American Theatre'', October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===

[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|location=New York; London|isbn=0-393-32363-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] wrote about a hanging in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1840, and "taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments".&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt;

== Children ==
{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}
}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of [[jester]] consisted of verbal humour, including [[teasing]], jests, [[insult]], ridicule, and [[obscenity]] and [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] humour such as [[slapstick]] and horseplay in the presence of an audience."&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In medieval times, all comic types{{snd}} the [[buffoon]], jester, [[hunchback]], [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], jokester, were all "considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hokenson|first=Jan Walsh|title=The Idea of Comedy: History, Theory, Critique|year=2006|publisher=Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp|location=Cranbury, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-4096-6|pages=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Robert|title=The English clown tradition from the middle ages to Shakespeare|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In [[farce]], the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Ashley|title=The role of the chou ("clown") in traditional Chinese drama: comedy, criticism, and cosmology on the Chinese stage|year=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=0-7734-5303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple physical comedy such as [[slapstick]] is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32706-8&lt;!-- (set)--&gt;|editor=Charney, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

[[File:Cimrman autobusta.jpg|thumb|150px|Jára Cimrman's self-bust]]

'''Externism''' is a [[fiction]]al [[philosophical theory]] proposed by the fictional [[Czech people|Czech]] genius [[Jára Cimrman]]. This character appears in many plays by authors from the [[Jára Cimrman Theatre]] in Prague. The first [[act (theater)|act]] of the theatre performances is usually filled with a lecture on Cimrman's personality, followed by a theatrical play. The theory of externism is described in a monologue by a Cimrmanologist having a lecture on Jára Cimrman's significance in the field of [[philosophy]] in the first act of the theatre play ''[[Akt (theatre play)|Akt]]'' (''The Nude'') by [[Zdeněk Svěrák]], [[Ladislav Smoljak]] and [[Jiří Šebánek]].

This [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory contradicts the traditional theory of [[solipsism]]. While solipsists believe that only their individual self exists and the external world does not, Jára Cimrman confronted them with the idea that it is the external world which exists and the philosopher's individual self does not.

At first this idea was met with huge disagreement among philosophers. Jára Cimrman was invited to defend his theory to the philosophical congress in [[Basel]]. The key [[counterargument]] that he had to face was: How could a non-existing consciousness create a theory?

Jára Cimrman replied that the fact that he does not exist does not mean he is not [[perception|perceptible]]. He compared the world to a space with a small place in the middle, where Jára Cimrman is missing. If we take a piece of paper with a hole in the middle, the paper can be compared to the external world and the hole (which is clearly visible) to the non-existing philosopher. Stretching and contracting the space results in the opposite change in the form of the hole. This movement can be viewed as a process of philosopher's thinking.

Later Cimrman elaborated the theory into more detail, as Cimrmanologists found out when reading [[Albert Einstein]]'s correspondence. He proposed that even other objects in our world do not exist in the way it is usually thought. In fact, an object is located in the place where we think it is not, and it is not in the place where we consider it to be. For example, if you take a piece of chalk, the chalk forms a huge mass all around itself, where the chalk may be, with a small bubble inside, where the chalk is definitely not.

Albert Einstein considered the theory to be "funny", which Cimrmanologists read as an expression of admiration. However, he had some objections as well. "As a physicist, I have to point out that it makes no difference if you call an object 'emptiness' and the emptiness 'object'," he wrote, "It is just ping-pong with words."

Cimrman's rival in the field of philosophy was F. C. Bohlen (another fictitious philosopher). He owned a pharmacy and was known for using exceptionally rude language. According to this vulgar [[materialist]] (which also means "pharmacist" in [[Czech language|Czech]]), the [[truth]] is the basic principle of our [[knowledge]]. In the beginning of the [[cognition|learning process]], the truth is inaccurate and we make it more precise.  Finally, we know everything.

Cimrman stated that in the beginning of every learning process, our knowledge is formed by a [[Error|mistake]], which is precise, and we must disconfirm it.  Finally, we know nothing.  Despite this, Cimrman cannot be considered to be an [[agnostic]] or [[nihilism|nihilist]]. On the contrary, he sees the learning process positively as a process of disproving the initial mistake. Thus, we can finally stand face-to-face with the [[Universe]], having our head clear and empty.

The fact that in the end we know nothing is just a [[logic]]al consequence of Cimrman's externism. The example with the chalk showed that in the learning process, when we try to get nearer to an object, we always reach a place where the object is not. Therefore, in the end of the process, we know nothing but we know it exactly.

The theory can be easily applied to the whole of [[existence]], except for the theory itself. When doing so, we seemingly disprove it: either it is a mistake, or we do not know it. Therefore, Cimrman created  a revolutionary solution: Cimrman's "Step-Aside". Thus he, just for a little while, appeared in the world of vulgar materialism, and could confirm his theory as valid. The [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s of both theories he joined together with a colon: "We know everything: We know nothing."

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

====Narrator====
The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

==16th century==

===Charles IX===

[[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593),&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Christopher. Complete works. Oxford University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; based on events during the reign of [[Charles IX of France]], king from 1560 to 1574 and of [[Henry III of France]], king from 1574 to 1589. In the first scene, a marriage is celebrated between [[Marguerite of Valois]], sister to Charles IX, and Henry of Navarre, king of Navarre, future [[Henry IV of France]]. Soon after, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], leader of the Calvinist French [[Huguenot]] faction, is shot to death by a man in the hire of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], an event which precipitates the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in August 1572.

===Philip II===

[[William Shakespeare]] wrote ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'' (1596), ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (1599), ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' (1592), ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'' (1591), and ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]'' (1591),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. Complete works (6th ed). New York: Longman, 2008. http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&lt;/ref&gt; based on events during the reigns of [[John of England]], king from 1199 to 1216, [[Henry V of England]], king from 1413 to 1422, [[Henry VI of England]], king from 1422 to 1461 and from 1470 to 1471, [[Philip II of France]], king from 1180 to 1223, [[Charles VI of France]], king from 1380 to 1422, and [[Charles VII of France]], king from 1422 to 1461.

In the first scene of ''King John'', [[John of England]] receives a message from [[Philip II of France]], demanding that he abdicate his throne to his nephew, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], believed to be the rightful heir. When John refuses, war is declared. But to obtain a stronger claim to his throne and to appease the French (act 2, scene 1), John agrees to a marriage contract between [[Blanche of Castile]], his niece, and [[Louis the Lion]], Philip's son (1200). In 1203, John captures Arthur, who eventually dies (act 4, scene 3).

===Charles VI===

In the first scene of ''Henry V'', [[Henry V of England]] asks noblemen and clergy whether he is entitled to the crown of France, who answer affirmatively, based on French [[Salic law]]. As a part of the [[Hundred Years' War]], 1337–1453, the English forces invade France, besieging [[Harfleur]] (1415), act 3, scene 1, and defeat the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415). In the final scene, the king marries [[Catherine of Valois]] (1420), daughter to King Charles VI.

===Charles VII===

In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 1'' during the funeral procession of Henry V (1422), the duke of Bedford and other noblemen learn of military disasters at the hands of the French, led by the dauphin Charles, future King Charles VII, who successfully recapture several cities on French soil. In act 1 scene 8, the siege of Orleans is lifted (1429) by Charles with the help of [[Joan of Arc]] (1412–1431). In act 4, scene 1, during the coronation of Henry VI (1429), the Yorkists wear white roses on their hats, while the Lancastrians wear red roses, prefiguring the [[War of the Roses]] (1455–1485). In act 5 scene 6, Joan of Arc is condemned to be burnt alive, but no mention is made of her trial (1431). In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 2'', King Henry VI of England marries [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, of the [[House of Valois]], niece to King Charles VII, arranged by the marquis of Suffolk, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] as a way to influence the young king through her. In the marriage contract, the English lose the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine and no dowry is given ([[Treaty of Tours]], 1445). In the final scene, the Yorkists are victorious after the [[First Battle of St Albans]] (1455) during the [[War of the Roses]]. In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 3'', the Yorkists confront the supporters of Henry VI, who discuss whether the king should accept the issue of the duke of York as king. Queen Margaret refuses to accept that her son, Edward, be disinherited. With her principal commander, [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset]], she fights successfully for a while the Yorkists but is eventually defeated by them, whereby the son of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], is proclaimed [[King Edward IV of England]] and she sent away to France (1461).

Contrary to popular belief, Geisha are not the Eastern equivalent of a prostitute; a misconception originating in the West due to interactions with [[Oiran]] Japanese courtesans, whose traditional attire is similar to that of geisha.

The word ''geisha'' consists of two [[kanji]], {{nihongo2|芸}} (''Gei'') meaning "[[art]]" and {{nihongo2|者}} (''Sha'') meaning "person" or "doer". The most literal translation of geisha into English would be "artist", "performing artist", or "artisan". Another name for geisha is ''Geiko'' ({{nihongo2|芸妓}}), which translates specifically as "Woman of Art". This term is used to refer to geisha from Western Japan, which includes Kyoto and Kanazawa.

Apprentice geisha are called ''[[Maiko]]'' ({{nihongo2|舞妓}}), literally "Woman of Dance", or ''Hangyoku'' (半玉), "Half-Jewel" (meaning that they were paid half of the wage of a full geisha),&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Masuda |first=Sayo |date=2003 |title=Autobiography of a Geisha |translator-last=Rowley |translator-first=G. G. |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-12951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the more generic term ''o-shaku'' ({{nihongo2|御酌}}), literally "one who pours (alcohol)". The white make-up and elaborate [[kimono]] and hair of a maiko is the popular image held of geisha. A woman entering the geisha community does not have to begin as a maiko, having the opportunity to begin her career as a full geisha. Either way, however, usually a year's training is involved before debuting either as a maiko or as a geisha. A woman above 21 is considered too old to be a maiko and becomes a full geisha upon her initiation into the geisha community.

On average, Tokyo apprentices (who typically begin at 18) are slightly older than their Kyoto counterparts (who usually start at 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=218 |chapter=The Real Memoirs of Geisha |date=May 2006 |isbn=978-1-58648-394-4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJy_g4eYX2cC&amp;pg=200 |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |first=Sheridan |last=Prasso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, geisha often began the earliest stages of their training at a very young age, sometimes as early as 6 years old. The early ''Shikomi'' (in-training) and ''Minarai'' (learns by watching) stages of geisha training lasted for years (shikomi) and months (minarai) respectively, which is significantly longer than in contemporary times. A girl is often a shikomi for up to a year while the modern minarai period is simply one month.

It is still said that geisha inhabit a separate world which they call the ''Karyūkai'' or "The Flower and Willow World". Before [[Oiran#History|they disappeared]], the [[Oiran|courtesans]] were the colourful "flowers" and the geisha the "[[Willow#Culture|willows]]" because of their subtlety, strength, and grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=5–6 |publisher=Gotham |date=February 2004 |origyear=2003 |isbn=978-1-59240-050-8 |title=Madame [[Sada Yacco|Sadayakko]] The Geisha Who Bewitched the West |last=Downer |first=L. |chapter=In Search of Sadayakko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the early stages of Japanese history, there were female entertainers: ''Saburuko'' (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families were displaced from struggles in the late 600s. Some of these ''saburuko'' girls sold sexual services, while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings. After the imperial court moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyoto) in [[Heian period#History|794]] the conditions that would form geisha culture began to emerge, as it became the home of a [[Heian period#Beauty|beauty-obsessed elite]].&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art |location=London |publisher=PRC |date=2003 |isbn=1-85648-697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled female performers, such as [[Shirabyōshi]] dancers, thrived.

Traditional Japan embraced sexual delights (it is not a [[Shinto]] taboo) and men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/16/the-rise-of-the-geisha-photos-from-19th-20th-century-show-the-japanese-entertainers/ |title=The Rise of the Geisha - photos from 19th &amp; 20th century show the Japanese entertainers |first=Neil |last=Patrick |date=16 May 2016 |website=The Vintage News |access-date=6 November 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal wife was a modest mother and manager of the home; by [[Confucian view of marriage|Confucian custom]] love had secondary importance. For sexual enjoyment and romantic attachment, men did not go to their wives, but to [[courtesan]]s. Walled-in pleasure quarters known as {{Nihongo||遊廓、遊郭|[[yūkaku]]}} were built in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of geisha |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/culture/geisha.shtml |website=Japan Zone |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1617 the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] designated "pleasure quarters", outside of which prostitution would be illegal,&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; and within which ''yūjo'' ("play women") would be [[Prostitution in Japan#Shogunate era|classified and licensed]]. The highest ''yūjo'' class was the geisha's predecessor, called ''[[tayuu]]'', a combination of [[actress]] and prostitute, originally playing on stages set in the dry [[Kamo River|Kamo]] riverbed in Kyoto. They performed erotic dances and skits, and this new art was dubbed ''kabuku'', meaning "to be wild and outrageous". The dances were called "kabuki", and this was the [[Kabuki#1603.E2.80.931629: Female kabuki|beginning of kabuki theater]].&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

===18th-century emergence of the geisha===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Beauty - Gion Seitoku.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe depicting a Gion geisha, from between 1800 and 1833]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - A Kyoto Geisha - Yamaguchi Soken.jpg|thumb|Ukiyoe print by Yamaguchi Soken of a Kyoto geisha]]
These pleasure quarters quickly became glamorous entertainment centers, offering more than sex. The highly accomplished courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing, and playing music. Some were renowned poets and [[calligraphy|calligraphers]]. Gradually, they all became specialized and the new profession, purely of entertainment, arose. It was near the turn of the eighteenth century that the first entertainers of the pleasure quarters, called ''geisha'', appeared. The first geishas were men, entertaining customers waiting to see the most popular and gifted courtesans (''[[oiran]]'').&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

The forerunners of the female geisha were the teenage ''odoriko'' ("dancing girls"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Geisha Girl |url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofgeishagir00fujiuoft#page/18/mode/2up |first=Taizo |last=Fujimoto |page=18 |isbn=978-1-4086-9684-2 |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; expensively trained as chaste [[dance]]rs-for-hire. In the 1680s, they were popular paid entertainers in the private homes of upper-class samurai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoshiwara: the glittering world of the Japanese courtesan |first=C. S. |last=Seigle |date=March 1993 |origyear=1931 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4T-kJB8vKvcC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=171 |chapter=Rise of the Geisha |isbn=978-0-8248-1488-5 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many had turned to prostitution by the early 18th century. Those who were no longer teenagers (and could no longer style themselves ''odoriko''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Osaka Prints: Glossary |first=J. |last=Fiorillo |url=http://www.osakaprints.com/content/information/glossary.htm |quote=''geiko'': "Arts child", originally dancing girls who were too young to be called geisha but too old (more than twenty years of age) to be called odoriko.

===Rise of the geisha===
[[File:Tokyo Geisha with Shamisen c1870s,.jpg|thumb|Tokyo ''geisha'' with ''[[shamisen]]'', circa 1870s]]
The geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were essentially imprisoned and strictly forbidden to sell sex in order to protect the business of the [[oiran]]. While licensed courtesans existed to meet men's sexual needs, ''machi geisha'' carved out a separate niche as artists and erudite female companions.

By 1800, being a geisha was considered a female occupation (though there are still a handful of male geisha working today). Eventually, the gaudy Oiran began to fall out of fashion, becoming less popular than the chic ("[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)#Interpretation|iki]]") and modern geisha.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; By the 1830s, the evolving geisha style was emulated by fashionable women throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/geisha.html |page=74 |chapter=The paradox of modernity |first1=L. C. |last1=Dalby |oclc=260152400}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many different classifications and ranks of geisha. Some women would have sex with their male customers, whereas others would entertain strictly with their art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=347 |title=Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms: The Militarization of Aesthetics in Japanese History |first=E. |last=Ohnuki-Tierney |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-226-62091-6 |quote=[Before 1796] ''kuruwa geisha'' referred to the geisha in the geisha quarters who entertained their clients with the skills and performing arts and also offered their bodies.

[[World War II]] brought a huge decline in the geisha arts because most women had to go to factories or elsewhere to contribute to post war reconstruction. The geisha name also lost some status during this time because prostitutes began referring to themselves as "geisha girls" to American military men.&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalby |first=Liza |year=1998 |title=Geisha |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the geisha world, including the teahouses, bars and geisha houses, was forced to close, and all employees were put to work in factories. About a year later, they were allowed to reopen. The few women who returned to the geisha areas decided to reject Western influence and revert to traditional ways of entertainment and life. "The image of the geisha was formed during Japan's feudal past, and this is now the image they must keep in order to remain geisha."&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; It was up to these returning geisha to bring back traditional standards in the profession, though with increased rights for the geisha:
{{quote |text=After Japan lost the war, geisha dispersed and the profession was in shambles. When they regrouped during the Occupation and began to flourish in the 1960s during Japan's postwar economic boom, the geisha world changed.

Nowadays, a geisha's sex life is her private affair. |sign=[[Liza Dalby]] |source=Do They or Don't They?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/ng_geisha_sex.html |title=Do They or Don't They |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Dalby |first=Liza |website=lizadalby.com |quote=The question always comes up...just how 'available' is a geisha? ...

In her book ''Geisha, a Life'', [[Mineko Iwasaki]] said: "I lived in the karyukai during the 1960s and 1970s, a time when Japan was undergoing the radical transformation from a post-feudal to a modern society. But I existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past."&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"/&gt;

==Ranking==
At the pinnacle of the complex geisha ranking system are the [[dowager#Noun|grand dowagers]] of Kyoto. The ''Gokagai'' of Kyoto are its five geisha districts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyoto-gion-corner.info/ookini_en/introduction.html |title=Kyoto Gokagai |publisher=Kyoto Traditional Musical Art Foundation}} The total number of Kyoto geisha had declined to 196 by 2007 (and 77 maiko); see: {{cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/newgeishanotes.html |title=Preface "Geisha in the 21st Century" in the 25th anniversary edition of ''Geisha'' |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''[[hanamachi]]'' ("flower towns"). [[Gion|Gion Kobu]], [[Pontocho]] and [[Kamishichiken]] have the highest status;&lt;ref&gt;[[Liza Dalby|Dalby]]—''Geisha'' 2008 pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; they are very expensive and are frequented by powerful businessmen and [[Politics of Japan#Human factor|politicians]]&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt; (Gion Kobu is sometimes seen as having the very highest ranking). As reported by Dalby (1983) from her impressions in 1975&lt;ref&gt;''Geisha'' 2008 pp. 18, 77, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiko from the other two ''hanamachi'' (Gion Higashi and [[Miyagawa Cho]]) have high prestige but are considered to be one rank lower.

==Stages of training==
[[File:Geisha, maiko, shikomi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Geiko Fumikazu with her minarai imōto Momokazu, and a shikomi from the Odamoto okiya]]
Traditionally, Geisha began their training at a young age. Some girls were bonded to geisha houses (''[[okiya]]'') as children. Daughters of geisha were often brought up as geisha themselves, usually as the successor (atotori, meaning "heir" or "heiress" in this particular situation) or daughter-role (musume-bun) to the okiya.

A maiko is an apprentice and is therefore bonded under a contract to her okiya. The okiya supplies her with food, board, kimono, [[Obi (sash)|obi]], and other tools of her trade. Her training is very expensive and her debt must be repaid to the okiya with the earnings she makes. This repayment may continue after the maiko becomes a full-fledged geisha and only when her debts are settled is she permitted to move out to live and work independently.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

A maiko will start her formal training on the job as a ''minarai'', which literally means "learning by watching" at an ozashiki (お座敷, a banquet in any [[Minka|traditional Japanese building]] with [[tatami]]), to sit and observe as the other maiko and geiko interact with customers. This is a way in which she will gain insights of the job, and seek out potential clients. Although minarai attend ''ozashiki'', they do not participate at an advanced level. Their [[kimono]], more elaborate than a geiko's, are intended to do the talking for them. Minarai can be hired for parties but are usually uninvited (yet welcomed) guests at parties that their ''onee-san'' attends. They only charge a third of the usual fee. Minarai generally work with a particular tea house (''Minarai-jaya'') learning from the ''okaa-san'' (literally "mother", the proprietress of the house). From her, they would learn techniques such as conversation and gaming, which would not be taught to them in school. This stage lasts only about a month or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geisha: A Life |last1=Iwasaki |first1=Mineko |authorlink1=Mineko Iwasaki |last2=Brown Ouchi |first2=Rande |authorlink2=Rande Gail Brown |page=132 |publisher=Atria |edition=first |date=October 2002 |isbn=978-0-7434-4432-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Performing Gion Kouta.jpg|thumb|Maiko Katsumi and Mameteru performing the Gion Kouta.]]
After a short period the final stage of training begins, and the students are now called "maiko", rather than minarai. Maiko (literally "dance girl") are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for up to 5 years. Maiko learn from their senior maiko and geiko mentors. The ''onee-san'' and ''imouto-san'' (senior/junior, literally "older sister/younger sister") relationship is important. The ''onee-san'', any maiko or geiko who is senior to a girl, teaches her maiko everything about working in the [[hanamachi]]. The onee-san will teach her proper ways of serving tea, playing [[shamisen]], dancing, casual conversation and more.

[[File:Geisha-obi.jpg|thumb|left|Senior ''maiko'' Suzuha wearing ''[[sakkō]]'', two weeks before her ''[[erikae]]''.]]
There are three major elements of a maiko's training. The first is the formal arts training. This takes place in special geisha schools which are found in every ''hanamachi''. The second element is the entertainment training which the maiko learns at various tea houses and parties by observing her ''onee-san''. The third is the social skill of navigating the complex social web of the ''hanamachi''. This is done on the streets. Formal greetings, gifts, and visits are key parts of any social structure in Japan and for a maiko, they are crucial for her to build the support network she needs to survive as a geisha.

Maiko are considered one of the great sights of Japanese tourism, and look very different from fully qualified geisha. They are at the peak of traditional Japanese femininity. The scarlet-fringed collar of a maiko's kimono hangs very loosely in the back to accentuate the nape of the neck, which is considered a primary erotic area in Japanese sexuality. She wears the same white makeup for her face on her nape, leaving two or sometimes three stripes of bare skin exposed. Her kimono is bright and colourful with an elaborately tied ''obi'' hanging down to her ankles. She takes very small steps and wears traditional wooden shoes called ''[[okobo]]'' which stand nearly ten centimeters high.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt; There are five different [[hairstyle]]s that a maiko wears, that mark the different stages of her apprenticeship. The "[[Nihongami]]" hairstyle with [[Hairstyling tool#Kanzashi|"kanzashi"]] hair-ornamentation strips is most closely associated with maiko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nihongami no sekai |first=I. |last=Tetsuo |trans-title=The World of traditional hairstyles and hair ornaments |publisher=Nihongami Shiryōkan |isbn=4-9902186-1-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on holed-pillows to preserve the elaborate styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/geisha4.htm |title=Dressing as a Geisha |first=J. |last=Layton |website=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiko can develop a [[#Hair|bald spot on their crown]] caused by rubbing from Kanzashi strips and tugging in hairdressing.

Around the age of 20–21, the maiko is promoted to a full-fledged geisha in a ceremony called ''[[erikae]]'' (turning of the collar).&lt;ref name="Melissa Hope Ditmore 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Wayne |last2=Gallagher |first2=John |title=Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art |publisher=PRC Publishing |location= |year=2003 |page=159 |isbn=1-85648-697-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPDkdaPE3aUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22John+Gallagher.%22+geisha&amp;client=safari#PPA159,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could happen after three to five years of her life as a ''maiko'' or ''hangyoku'', depending on at what age she debuted. Geisha remain as such until they retire.

==Female dominance in geisha society==
{{quote |text=The biggest industry in Japan is not shipbuilding, producing cultured pearls, or manufacturing transistor radios or cameras. It is entertainment.|sign=Boye De Mente |source=''Some Prefer Geisha''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boye |year=1966 |title=Some Prefer Geisha |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Company |location=Rutland, VT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term geisha literally translates to "entertainer". Some prostitutes refer to themselves as "geisha", but they are not. A geisha's sex and love life is usually distinct from her professional life. A successful geisha can entertain her male customers with music, dance, and conversation.

{{quote |text=Geishas are not submissive and subservient, but in fact they are some of the most financially and emotionally successful and strongest women in Japan, and traditionally have been so.|sign=Iwasaki Mineko|source=''Geisha, A Life''&lt;ref name="Mineko 2003"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Mineko |first1=Iwasaki |first2=Rande |last2=Brown |year=2003 |title=Geisha, A Life |publisher=Washington Square |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Geisha learn the traditional skills of dance and instruments and hold high [[social status]]. Geisha are single women, though they may have lovers or boyfriends whom they have personally picked, who support them financially.

{{quote |text=There is currently no western equivalent for a geisha—they are truly the most impeccable form of Japanese art. |sign=Kenneth Champeon |source=''The Floating World''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/2130 |title=The Floating World|accessdate=12 January 2010|last=Champeon|first=Kenneth|date=3 November 2002|format=|work=|publisher=Things Asian|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Relationships with male guests===
The appeal of a high-ranking geisha to her typical male guest has historically been very different from that of his wife. The ideal geisha showed her skill, while the ideal wife was modest. The ideal geisha seemed carefree, the ideal wife somber and responsible. Historically, geisha did sometimes marry their clients, but marriage necessitated retirement, as there were never married geisha.

Geisha may gracefully flirt with their guests, but they will always remain in control of the hospitality. Over their years of apprenticeship they learn to adapt to different situations and personalities, mastering the art of the hostess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://aminoapps.com/page/anime/5627502/what-is-a-geisha |title=What Is A Geisha? |website=Amino Apps |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geisha as a women-centered society===
Women in the geisha society are some of the most successful businesswomen in Japan. In the geisha society, women run everything. Without the impeccable business skills of the female tea house owners, the world of geisha would cease to exist. The tea house owners are entrepreneurs, whose service to the geisha is highly necessary for the society to run smoothly. Infrequently, men take contingent positions such as hair stylists,&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt; dressers (dressing a maiko requires considerable strength) and accountants,&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt; but men have a limited role in geisha society.

{{quote |text=The geisha system was founded, actually, to promote the independence and economic self-sufficiency of women. And that was its stated purpose, and it actually accomplished that quite admirably in Japanese society, where there were very few routes for women to achieve that sort of independence. |sign=[[Mineko Iwasaki]] in interview |source=''[[Boston Phoenix]]''&lt;ref name="Wieder"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Tamara |last=Wieder |title=Remaking a memoir |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106181143/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |archivedate=6 January 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The majority of women were wives who did not work outside of their familial duties. Becoming a geisha was a way for women to support themselves without becoming a wife. Thus, some argue {{who?|date=June 2018}}  that geisha women live in a women-centered society.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Women run the geisha houses, they are teachers, they run the tea houses, they recruit aspiring geisha, and they keep track of a geisha's finances.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The only major role men play in geisha society is that of guest, though women sometimes take that role as well.&lt;ref name="tak"/&gt;

Historically, [[Feminism in Japan|Japanese feminists]] have seen geisha as exploited women, but some modern geisha see themselves as liberated feminists:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1656 |title=Japanese Feminism |accessdate=12 January 2010 |last=Collins |first=Sarah |date=24 December 2007 |website=Serendip Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We find our own way, without doing family responsibilities. Isn't that what feminists are?"&lt;ref name="Dalby 1998"/&gt;

==Modern geisha==
Modern geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called ''okiya'' in areas called ''[[hanamachi]]'' ({{nihongo2|花街}} "flower streets"), particularly during their apprenticeship. Many experienced geisha are successful enough to choose to live independently. The elegant, high-culture world that geisha are a part of is called ''karyūkai'' ({{nihongo2|花柳界}} "the flower and willow world").

Before the twentieth century, geisha training began when a girl was around the age of six. Now, girls must go to school until they are 15 years old and have graduated from middle school and then make the personal decision to train to become a geisha. Young women who wish to become geisha now most often begin their training after high school or even college. Many more women begin their careers in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=now more [university] students are interested in becoming geisha |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisha still study traditional instruments: the ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[shakuhachi]]'', and drums, as well as learn games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=29 |title=Japan the Culture |first=B. |last=Kalman |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7787-9298-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traditional songs, [[Japanese calligraphy#Today|calligraphy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=2 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype, page 2|date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese traditional dances (in the [[nihonbuyō]] style), [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], literature, and [[japanese poetry|poetry]].&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_performing_arts.html |title=Japan Performing Arts |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coutsoukis-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_dance.html |title=Japan Dance |first=Photius |last=Coutsoukis |date=10 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2009}} Originally from The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

By watching other geisha, and with the assistance of the owner of the geisha house, apprentices also become skilled dealing with clients and in the complex traditions surrounding selecting and wearing [[kimono]], a floor length silk robe embroidered with intricate designs which is held together by a sash at the waist which is called an obi.&lt;ref name="tames-1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tames |first=Richard |title=A Traveller's History of Japan |date=September 1993 |publisher=Interlink Books |location=[[Brooklyn, New York]]|isbn=1-56656-138-8 |page= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kalman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalman |first=Bobbie |title=Japan the Culture |date=March 1989 |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=[[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]] |isbn=0-86505-206-9 |pages= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Japan, geisha and their apprentices are now a rare sight outside ''hanamachi'' or {{nihongo||茶屋街|chayagai|literally "tea house district", often referred to as "entertainment district"}}. In the 1920s, there were over 80,000 geisha in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggmbp2pv8toC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=182 |title=Kyoto: a cultural history |first=John |last=Dougill |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-530137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=geisha+80,000#v=onepage&amp;q=geisha%2080%2C000&amp;f=false |page=639 |title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc |year=2000 |isbn=0-87779-017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today, there are far fewer.

A sluggish economy, declining interest in the traditional arts, the exclusive nature of the flower and willow world, and the expense of being entertained by geisha have all contributed to the tradition's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |quote=An economic downturn in the 1990s forced businessmen to cut back on entertainment expenses, while high-profile scandals in recent years have made politicians eschew excessive spending.

[[File:Ichiriki entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Ichiriki Ochaya]], one of the most famous tea houses where ''geiko'' entertain in Gion Kobu]]
Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at {{nihongo||お茶屋|[[ochaya]]|literally "tea houses"}} or at traditional Japanese restaurants (ryōtei).&lt;ref name="kalman"/&gt; The charge for a geisha's time, which used to be determined by [[Incense clock#Stick incense clocks|measuring a burning incense stick]], is called ''senkōdai'' ({{nihongo2|線香代}}, "incense stick fee") or gyokudai ({{nihongo2|玉代}} "jewel fee"). Now they are flat fees charged by the hour. In Kyoto, the terms ''ohana'' ({{nihongo2|お花}}) and ''hanadai'' ({{nihongo2|花代}}), meaning "flower fees", are preferred. The okasan makes arrangements through the geisha union office ({{nihongo2|検番}} ''kenban''), which keeps each geisha's schedule and makes her appointments both for entertaining and for training.

==Non-Japanese Geisha==
Since the 1970s, non-Japanese have also attempted to become geishas.  
[[Liza Dalby]], an American national worked briefly with geisha in the [[Pontocho]] district of [[Kyoto]] as part of her doctorate research, although she did not formally debut as a geisha herself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyslop |first=Leah |title=Liza Dalby, the blue-eyed geisha |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8008802/Liza-Dalby-the-blue-eyed-geisha.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 July 2011 |location=London |date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liza |first=Dalby |title=Geisha |year=1983 |publisher=Vintage U.K. |location=London |isbn=9780099286387 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The district of [[Gion]] in [[Kyoto, Japan]] does not accept non-Japanese women to train for becoming a geisha due to their ultra–traditionalist environment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Public performances==
While traditionally geishas have led a cloistered existence, in recent years they have become more publicly visible, and entertainment is available without requiring the traditional introduction and connections.

The most visible form of this are public dances, or ''[[Japanese traditional dance|odori]]'' (generally written in [[Historical kana orthography|traditional kana spelling]] as をどり, rather than modern おどり), featuring both maikos and geishas. All the Kyoto hanamachi hold these annually (mostly in spring, with one exclusively in autumn), dating to the [[Kyoto exhibition]] of 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php |title=Maiko Dance |website=Into Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around 1500 yen to 4500 yen – top-price tickets also include an optional [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] (tea and [[wagashi]] served by maiko) before the performance;&lt;ref name="geishadances"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |title=Geisha dances |website=Geisha of Japan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102225341/http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |archivedate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Hanamachi#Kyoto hanamachi|Kyoto hanamachi]] and [[Hanamachi#Hanamachi in Kanazawa|Kanazawa hanamachi]] for a detailed listing.

==Arts==
[[File:Dancing geisha, Gion, Kyoto - August 30, 2007.jpg|thumb|''Geisha'' are skilled artists, trained in and performing music and dance.]]
[[File:Two geishas playing shamisen.jpg|thumb|''Geisha'' Komomo and Mameyoshi from Gion Kobu playing ''shamisen'']]
Geisha begin their study of music and dance when they are very young and continue it throughout their lives. Geisha can work into their eighties and nineties,&lt;ref name="kyotox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just+Woman/News/Women+In+The+News/Story/A1Story20071203-39347.html |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |date=3 December 2007 |quote=Girls in the past could become apprentice geishas from the age of 13, but it is now illegal to become an apprentice before 18 except in Kyoto where a girl can be an apprentice at 15. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expected to train every day even after seventy years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Times |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |quote=Even the older sisters who became geisha as teenagers, they are [now] over 80 but still train every day |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance of the geisha has evolved from the dance performed on the noh and kabuki stages. The "wild and outrageous" dances transformed into a more subtle, stylized, and controlled form of dance. It is extremely disciplined, similar to [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]]. Every dance uses gestures to tell a story and only a connoisseur can understand the subdued symbolism. For example, a tiny hand gesture represents reading a love letter, holding the corner of a handkerchief in the mouth represents coquetry and the long sleeves of the elaborate kimono are often used to symbolize dabbing tears.&lt;ref name="Downer"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lesley |last=Downer |chapter=The City Geisha and Their Role in Modern Japan: Anomaly or artistes  |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=23 March 2006 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-517029-0 |pages=223–242}}{{Vague|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Let's have precise page numbers --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances are accompanied by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument is the [[shamisen]]. The shamisen was introduced to the geisha culture in 1750 and has been mastered by female Japanese artists for years.&lt;ref name=Maske&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maske |first=Andrew L. |title=Geisha: Beyond the Painted Smile |location=Peabody |publisher=[[Peabody Essex Museum]] |date=2004 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shamisen, originating in Okinawa, is a banjo-like three-stringed instrument that is played with a [[Plectrum#Non-Western instruments|plectrum]]. It has a very distinct, melancholy sound that is often accompanied by flute. The instrument is described as "melancholy" because traditional shamisen music uses only [[minor third]]s and sixths.&lt;ref name=Maske/&gt; All geisha must learn shamisen-playing, though it takes years to master. Along with the shamisen and the flute, geisha also learned to play a ''[[Tsuzumi|ko-tsuzumi]]'', a small, [[hourglass drum|hourglass-shaped]] shoulder drum, and a large floor ''[[taiko]]'' (drum). Some geisha would not only dance and play music, but would write beautiful, melancholy poems. Others painted pictures or composed music.&lt;ref name="Downer"/&gt;

==Geisha and prostitution==
Sheridan Prasso wrote that Americans had "an incorrect impression of the real geisha world ... geisha means 'arts person' trained in music and dance, not in the art of sexual pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Asian-Mystique-Fantasies-ebook/dp/B0036FTOBW |title=The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, and Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient |last=Prasso |first=Sheridan |date=April 2009 |location=New York |publisher=Public Affairs |isbn=978-1-58648-214-5 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.&amp;nbsp;G. Henshall wrote that the geisha's purpose was "to entertain their customer, be it by dancing, reciting verse, playing musical instruments, or engaging in light conversation. Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful [[innuendo]]s; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected. In a social style that is common in Japan, men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be."&lt;ref name="Henshall"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henshall |first=K. G. |date=1999 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |isbn=0-333-74940-5 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the new government passed a law liberating "prostitutes (shōgi) and geisha (geigi)". The wording of this statute was the subject of controversy. Some officials thought that prostitutes and geisha worked at different ends of the same profession—selling sex— and that all prostitutes should henceforth be called "geisha". In the end, the government decided to maintain a line between the two groups, arguing that geisha were more refined and should not be soiled by association with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Matsugu"&gt;{{cite book |first=Miho |last=Matsugu |chapter=In the Service of the Nation: Geisha and Kawabata Yasunari's 'Snow Country' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-iuYBiOkRgC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |editor-last1=Feldman |editor-first1=Martha |editor-last2=Gordon |editor-first2=Bonnie |title=The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural Perspectives |date=2006 |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517028-8 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, geisha working in ''[[onsen]]'' towns such as [[Atami]] are dubbed [[onsen geisha]]. Onsen geisha have been given a bad reputation due to the prevalence of prostitutes in such towns who market themselves as "geisha". In contrast to these "one-night geisha", the true onsen geisha are competent dancers and musicians. However, the [[Autobiography of a Geisha|autobiography of Sayo Masuda]], an onsen geisha who worked in Nagano Prefecture in the 1930s, reveals that in the past, such women were often under intense pressure to sell sex.&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"/&gt;

===Personal relationships and Danna partnership===
Geisha are portrayed as unattached. Formerly those who chose to marry had to retire from the profession, though today, some geisha are allowed to marry. It was traditional in the past for established geisha to take a ''danna'', or patron. A ''danna'' was typically a wealthy man, sometimes married, who had the means to support the very large expenses related to a geisha's traditional training and other costs. This sometimes occurs today as well, but very rarely. A geisha and her danna may or may not be in love, but intimacy is never viewed as a reward for the danna's financial support. While it is true that a geisha is free to pursue personal relationships with men she meets through her work, such relationships are carefully chosen and unlikely to be casual. A hanamachi tends to be a very tight-knit community and a geisha's good reputation is not taken lightly.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

==="Geisha (Gee-sha) girls"===
During the period of [[occupied Japan|the Allied occupation of Japan]], local women called "Geisha girls" worked as prostitutes. They almost exclusively serviced [[Military of the United States|American GIs]] stationed in the country, who actually referred to them as "Geesha girls" (a mispronunciation).&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Ozeki |title=Inside and other short fiction: Japanese women by Japanese women |publisher=Kodansha International |year=2005 |isbn=4-7700-3006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women dressed in ''kimono'' and imitated the look of geisha. Many Americans unfamiliar with the Japanese culture could not tell the difference between legitimate geisha and these costumed performers.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; Shortly after their arrival in 1945, some occupying American GIs are said to have congregated in [[Ginza]] and shouted, "We want geesha girls!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Booth |title=Looking for the Lost: Journeys Through a Vanishing Japan |publisher=Kodansha Globe Series |date=1995 |isbn=1-56836-148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, the English term "geisha girl" became a general word for any female Japanese prostitute or worker in the [[mizu shōbai]] and included [[Hostess bar|bar hostesses]] and [[streetwalker]]s.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

Geisha girls are speculated by [[Japanology|researchers]] to be largely responsible for the continuing misconception in [[Western world|the West]] that all geisha are engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt;

===Mizuage===
{{Main article|Mizuage}}
'''Mizuage''' ({{nihongo2|水揚げ}}) was a ceremony undergone by a maiko where she was promoted to [[senior status]] and changed her hairstyle from the junior wareshinobu to the senior ofuku.&lt;ref name="Prasso"/&gt; A ritual deflowering, also called mizuage, was practiced among prostitutes and geisha in smaller towns where these occupations often blurred lines. Prostitutes posing as geisha often used this term to refer to their acts with customers, which lead to great confusion when such prostitutes often called themselves "geisha" in the company of foreign soldiers and even Japanese customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geishaofjapan.com/history/world-war-ii-and-the-american-occupation/ |title=World War II and the American Occupation |website=Geisha of Japan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mizuage literally means "raising the waters" and originally meant unloading a ship's cargo of fish.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite book |title=East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir through the Seasons by Liza Dalby |date=February 2009 |authorlink=Liza Dalby |first=L. |last=Dalby |publisher=University of California Press |chapter=Waters dry up |isbn=978-0-520-25991-1 |pages=190–191 |quote=The resulting official line that geisha live by art alone is unrealistically [[prude|prudish]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the word came to represent money earned in the entertainment business.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

==Appearance==
[[File:Geisha-and-two-maiko.jpg|thumb|Mature ''geisha'' (center) ordinarily wear subdued clothing, makeup, and hair, contrasting with the more colourful clothing, heavy makeup, and elaborate hair of maiko (apprentices; left and right).]]
[[File:Maiko in Gion.jpg|thumb|The ''maiko'' Mamechiho in the Gion district. Notice the green pin on the mid-left called ''tsunagi-dango'': this identifies her as a maiko of Gion kobu under 18.]]
A geisha's appearance changes throughout her career, from the girlish, heavily made-up maiko, to the more somber appearance of an older established geisha. Different hairstyles and hairpins signify different stages of a girl's development and even a detail as minute as the length of one's eyebrows is significant. Short eyebrows are for the young and long eyebrows display maturity.&lt;ref name=Prasso&gt;Prasso, Sheridan. "The Asian Mystique." New York: Public Affairs, 2005:206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
{{Further information|History of cosmetics}}
In modern times the traditional makeup of apprentice geisha is one of their most recognizable characteristics, though established geisha generally only wear full white face makeup characteristic of maiko during special performances.

The traditional makeup of an apprentice geisha features a thick white base with red [[lipstick]] and red and black accents around the eyes and eyebrows. Originally, the white base mask was made with lead; after the discovery that it poisoned the skin and caused terrible skin and back problems for the older geisha towards the end of the [[Meiji period|Meiji Era]], it was replaced with rice powder.

The application of makeup is hard to perfect and is time-consuming. Makeup is applied before dressing to avoid dirtying the kimono. First, a wax or oil substance called ''bintsuke-abura'' is applied to the skin. Next, white powder is mixed with water into a paste and applied with a bamboo brush starting from the neck and working upwards. The white makeup covers the face, neck, and chest, with two or three unwhitened areas (forming a ''W'' or ''V'' shape, usually a traditional ''W'' shape) left on the [[nape]], to accentuate this traditionally erotic area, and a line of bare skin around the hairline, which creates the illusion of a mask.

After the foundation layer is applied, a sponge is patted all over the face, throat, chest, the nape and neck to remove excess moisture and to blend the foundation. Next the eyes and eyebrows are drawn in. Traditionally, charcoal was used, but today, modern cosmetics are used. The eyebrows and edges of the eyes are coloured black with a thin charcoal; a maiko also applies red around her eyes.

The lips are filled in using a small brush. The colour comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the lips luster. Rarely will a geisha colour in both lips fully in the Western style, as white creates optical illusions and colouring the lips fully would make them appear overly large. The lower lip is coloured in partially and the upper lip left white for maiko in her first year, after which the upper lip is coloured. Newly full-fledged geisha will colour in only the top lip fully. Most geisha wear the top lip coloured in fully or stylized, and the bottom lip in a curved stripe that does not follow the shape of the lip. Geisha round the bottom lips to create the illusion of a flower bud.

Maiko who are in their last stage of training sometimes [[Ohaguro|colour their teeth black]] for a brief period. This practice used to be common among married women in Japan and, earlier, at the imperial court, but survives only in some districts. It is done partly because uncoloured teeth seem very yellow in contrast to white face makeup; colouring the teeth black means that they seem to "disappear" in the darkness of the open mouth. This illusion is of course more pronounced at a distance.

For the first year, a maiko wears this heavy makeup almost constantly. During her initiation, the maiko is helped with her makeup either by her ''onee-san'', or "older sister" (an experienced geisha who is her mentor), or by the ''okaa-san'', or "mother" of her geisha house. After this, she applies the makeup herself.

After a maiko has been working for three years, she changes her make-up to a more subdued style. The reason for this is that she has now become mature, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. For formal occasions, the mature geisha will still apply white make-up. For geisha over thirty, the heavy white make-up is only worn during those special dances that require it.

===Dress===
[[File:Maiko and geisha back.jpg|thumb|A senior ''maiko'' (left) with ''darari obi'' and ''geisha'' with ''taiko-musubi'']]
[[File:Niigata geisha dancing2.jpg|thumb|Niigata ''geisha'' performing dance, dressed in ''kimono'' and ''taiko musubi'']]
Geisha always wear [[kimono]]. Apprentice geisha wear highly colourful kimono with extravagant [[Obi (sash)|obi]]. The obi is brighter than the kimono she is wearing to give a certain exotic balance. Maiko of Kyoto wear the obi tied in a style called "darari" (dangling obi), while Tokyo "hangyoku" wear it tied in various ways, including taiko musubi. Older geisha of Kyoto wear more subdued patterns and styles (most notably the obi tied in a simpler knot used by married women known as the "taiko musubi" ({{nihongo2|太鼓結び}}), or "drum knot"). Tokyo and Kanazawa geisha wear {{nihongo|"yanagi musubi"|柳結び||''willow style''}}, taiko musubi and {{nihongo|"tsunodashi musubi"|角出結び}}.

The colour, pattern, and style of ''kimono'' is dependent on the season and the event the geisha is attending. A ''kimono'' can take from two to three years to complete, due to painting and embroidering.

Geiko wear red or pink ''nagajuban'', or under-kimono. A maiko wears red with white printed patterns. The junior maiko's collar is predominantly red with white, silver, or gold embroidery. Two to three years into her apprenticeship, the red collar will be entirely embroidered in white (when viewed from the front) to show her seniority. When she becomes a fully fledged geisha her collar will turn from red to solid white.

Geisha wear raised wooden sandals, called ''[[geta (footwear)|geta]]'' while maiko wear a special wooden sandal known as ''[[okobo]]'' and wear only ''[[tabi]]'' (white split-toed socks) indoors. Geisha and apprentices wear the flat-soled sandal ''[[zōri]]'' outdoors during inclement weather.

===Hair===
[[File:Geiko - Tea ceremony.jpg|thumb|Mamechiho as a ''geiko''.]]
The hairstyles of geisha have varied through history. In the past, it has been common for women to wear their hair down in some periods and up in others. During the 17th century, women began putting all their hair up again, and it is during this time that the traditional [[shimada (hairstyle)|shimada hairstyle]], a type of [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] worn by most established geisha, developed.

There are two major types of the shimada seen in the karyukai: the ''Taka Shimada'', a high mage (high section) usually worn by young, single women and the ''Tsubushi Shimada'', a more flattened mage generally worn by older women Additional hairstyles for maiko include Wareshinobu, Ofuku, Katsuyama, Yakko Shimada, and [[Sakkō]]. Maiko of Pontocho will wear an additional six hairstyles leading up to Sakkō, including Oshidori, Kikugasane, Yuiwata, Suisha, Oshun, and Osafune.

These hairstyles are decorated with elaborate hair-combs and hairpins ([[kanzashi]]). Beginning In the seventeenth century and continuing through the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, hair-combs were large and conspicuous, generally more ornate for higher-class women. Following the Meiji Restoration and into the modern era, smaller and less conspicuous hair-combs became more popular.

Maiko sleep with their necks on small supports (takamakura), instead of pillows, so they keep their hairstyle perfect.&lt;ref name="tak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html?page=3 |title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype |date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |last=McCurry |first=J. |page=3 |location=Melbourne |newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there are no accidents, a maiko will need her hair styled every week.

Traditional hairstyling is a slowly dying art. Over time, the hairstyle can cause balding on the top of the head.

{{nihongo||先笄|'''[[Sakkō]]'''}} is a Japanese [[hairstyle]]. It is worn by maiko today, but was worn in the [[Edo period]] by wives to show their dedication to their husbands. Maiko wear it during a ceremony called [[Erikae]], which marks their graduation from maiko to [[geiko]]. Maiko use black wax to stain their teeth as well. Crane and  [[tortoiseshell]] ornaments are added as [[kanzashi]]. The style is twisted in many knots, and is quite striking and elaborate.

==In popular culture==
A growing number of geisha have complained to the authorities about being pursued down the street and tugged on the sleeves of their kimonos by groups of tourists keen to take their photograph. As a result, residents and local businesses have joined forces to protect the geisha by launching patrols of the streets of Kyoto's Gion entertainment district in order to prevent tourists from pestering them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/4018220/Tourists-warned-to-stop-harassing-Kyotos-geisha.html |title=Tourists warned to stop 'harassing' Kyoto's geisha |first=Danielle |last=Demetriou |date=30 December 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories are told about geisha. This includes Arthur Golden's popular English-language novel ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' which was adapted into a film in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7069">'''Hocus pocus''' is a generic term that may be derived from an ancient language and is currently used by stage [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]], usually the [[magic word]]s spoken when bringing about some sort of change. It was once a common term for a magician, [[Juggling|juggler]], or other similar [[entertainers]].

== History ==
The earliest known [[English language|English-language]] work on magic, or what was then known as ''[[legerdemain]]'' (sleight of hand), was published anonymously in 1635 under the title ''Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34375/34375-h/34375-h.htm "Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain"]&lt;/ref&gt; Further research suggests that "Hocus Pocus" was the stage name of a well known magician of the era. This may be William Vincent, who is recorded as having been granted a license to perform magic in [[England]] in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hocuspocusjr.com/hocvspocvsjr.htm The Web Site About the First Illustrated Book in the English Language Devoted Entirely to the Subject of Magic]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he was the author of the book is unknown.

== Conjectured origins ==
{{Refimprove

}}
The origins of the term remain obscure. The most popular conjecture is that it is a garbled Latin religious phrase or some form of [[dog Latin|‘dog’ Latin]]. Some have associated it with similar-sounding fictional, mythical, or legendary names. Others dismiss it as merely a combination of [[nonsense word]]s.

In some [[Slavic language]]s, "pokus" means an "attempt" or an "experiment", as for example in [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Slovak language]]. The word is derived from the [[Protoslavic]] word "kusiti", which is itself derived from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] "kausajn" meaning "to try", "to attempt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Králik|first1=Ľubor|title=Stručný etymologický slovník slovenčiny|date=2015|publisher=Veda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may indicate that the wording belongs to the [[alchemy]] kitchen and court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552 – 1612). Also, ''hocus'' may mean "to cheat" in Latin or a distorted form of the word ''hoc'', "this". Combination of the two words may give a sense, especially both meanings together "this attempt/experiment" and "cheated attempt/experiment".{{cn|date=December 2016}}

=== Dog Latin ===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the term originates from ''hax pax max Deus adimax'', a [[pseudo-Latin]] phrase used as a [[magical formula]] by [[Conjuror|conjurors]].&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford English Dictionary. [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hocuspocus] http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/hocuspocus&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe it originates from a corruption or [[parody]] of the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]], which contains the phrase “''[[Words of Institution|Hoc est enim corpus meum]]''”, meaning ''This is my body''.&lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Dictionary'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hocus-pocus] http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hocus-pocus&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation goes back to speculations by the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[prelate]] [[John Tillotson]], who wrote in 1694:{{Quote|In all probability those common juggling words of ''hocus pocus'' are nothing else but a corruption of ''hoc est corpus'', by way of ridiculous imitation of the priests of the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] in their trick of [[Transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19991007 Random House Words@Random: The Mavens' Word of the Day]; see [[Talk:Hocus Pocus (magic)]] for full quotation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This claim is substantiated by the fact that in the [[Netherlands]], the words ''Hocus pocus'' are usually accompanied by the additional words ''pilatus pas'', and this is said to be based on a post-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] parody of the traditional Catholic rite of [[transubstantiation]] during [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], being a Dutch corruption of the [[Latin]] words "''Hoc est corpus meum''" and the [[credo]], which reads in part, "''sub [[Pontius Pilate|Pontio Pilato]] [[Passion (Christianity)|passus]] et [[Burial of Jesus|sepultus est]]''", meaning ''under Pontius Pilate he suffered and was buried''.&lt;ref&gt;In de Kou, ''[[Godfried Bomans]] en Michel van der Plas over hun roomse jeugd en hoe het hun verging'', Amsterdam, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way the phrase is in [[Scandinavia]] usually accompanied by ''filiokus'', a corruption of the term [[filioque]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} from the [[Latin Church|Latin]] version of the [[Nicene Creed]], meaning “''and from the Son''”. The variant spelling ''filipokus'' is common in [[Russia]], a predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox]] nation, as well as certain other post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Additionally, the word for "stage trick" in [[Russian language|Russian]], ''fokus'', is derived from ''hocus pocus''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Magician’s name ===
Others believe that it is an appeal to the folkloric [[Norse mythology|Norse]] magician Ochus Bochus:{{Quote|text=Hocus Pocus: Words of pseudomagical import. According to [[Sharon Turner]] in ''The History of the Anglo-Saxons'' (4 vols., 1799-1805), they were believed to be derived from ''Ochus Bochus'', a magician and [[demon]] of the north.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}}}

=== Nonsense word ===
As an alternative to other theories, it may simply be [[pseudo-Latin]] with no meaning, made up to impress people:{{Quote|text=I will speak of one man... that went about in King James his time ... who called himself, “''The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus''”, and so was he called, because that at the playing of every Trick, he used to say, “''Hocus pocus, tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo''”, a dark composure of words, to blinde the eyes of the beholders, to make his Trick pass the more currently without discovery, because when the eye and the ear of the beholder are both earnestly busied, the Trick is not so easily discovered, nor the Imposture discerned.|author=[[Thomas Ady]] |source= ''A Candle in the Dark'', 1656&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hocus-pocus.html The Phrase Finder.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Infotainment''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''information'' and ''entertainment''),&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/infotainment|title=the definition of infotainment|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called soft news, is a type of [[Electronic media|media]], usually television, that provides a combination of information and [[entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;Demers, David, "Dictionary of Mss Communication and Media Research: a guide for students, scholars and professionals," Marquette, 2005, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used disapprovingly against more serious hard news.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam- Webster, The Cambridge Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Many existing, self-described infotainment [[website]]s and [[social media]] [[Mobile app|apps]] provide a variety of functions and services.&lt;ref&gt;"an extraordinary form of strategic internal communications" (infotainment.be) and historically accurate [[factoid]] collections (how-infotaining.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}            
The label "infotainment" is emblematic of concern and criticism that journalism is devolving from a medium which conveys serious information about issues affecting public interest, into a form of entertainment which happens to have fresh "facts" in the mix. The criteria by which [[reporter]]s and editors judge news value—whether something is worth putting on the front page, the bottom of the hour, or is worth commenting on at all—are integral parts of this debate. Some blame the media for this perceived phenomenon, for failing to live up to ideals of civic [[journalistic responsibility]], while others blame the [[commercialism|commercial]] nature of many media organizations, the need for higher ratings, combined with a preference among the public for feel-good content and "unimportant" topics such as [[celebrity]] [[gossip]] or sports.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In a critique of infotainment, Bonnie Anderson of ''News Flash'' cited a [[Cable News Network|CNN]] lead story on February 2, 2004 following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|exposure of Janet Jackson's breast]] on national television. The follow-up story was about a [[ricin]] chemical attack on then-[[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Bonnie M., "News Flash", Wiley 2004, p. 1, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialization process has also occurred, beginning with the rise of [[mass market]] special-interest magazines, moving into broadcast with the advent of [[cable television]], and continuing into new media such as the [[Internet]] and [[satellite radio]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} An increasing number of media outlets are available to the public which exclusively focus on single topics such as current events, home improvement, history, movies, women and Christianity. Consumers have a broad choice whether they receive a general feed of the most "important" information of the day or a highly customized presentation of a single type of content. Highly customized content streams may not be considered newsworthy nor contain a neutral point of view. Some publications and channels have found a sizable audience in the "niche" of featuring hard news.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Controversy has continued over the size of the audience and whether outlets are diluting content with too much "soft" news. The distinction between [[journalist]]s and anchors versus reporters are "[[human interest]]", personality, or celebrity news story pieces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''Soft'' news reporters and stories are typically directed by marketing share departments based on a demographic appeal and audience share. It is commonly accepted news anchors are also media personalities which may also be considered celebrities. Media outlets commonly use on-air personalities for their public appeal to promote the network's investments similar to the regular broadcast schedule including self-promotion and advertising. Critics might go so far as to view anchors as a weak link, representing the misplacement of both the credit and the accountability of a news journalism organization&amp;mdash;hence adding to a perceived erosion of journalistic standards throughout the news business.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} (See [[yellow journalism]].)

Most infotainment television programs on [[Television network|networks]] and broadcast cable only contain general information on the subjects they cover and should not be considered to be formal learning or instruction.  An example of a broadcast may include [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]s of a celebrity or other individual committing a crime with no verifiable factual support or evidence of such claims. It can be said that many viewers and social critics disapprove of how media, particularly TV and cable, seem to hurtle from one event to another, often dwelling on trivial, celebrity-driven content &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to [[mass communication]]. Bedford/St.Martin’s, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As seen with the commodification celebrities and public figures/leaders, news media is more frequently commodifying and selling the stories of people’s lives for pure viewer reaction and entertainment as opposed to more focus being placed on real stories with informative meaning behind them.

In October 2010 at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]], American political satirist [[Jon Stewart]] made a metaphorical statement regarding the media today: "The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems . . . illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic." This statement referred to the news media's ability to focus in on the real problems of people, and transform them into what is known as infotainment, when this information is solely provided for the public's entertainment. Today's broadcasting of informative news is often diluted with stories of scandal, although this is no concern for media and news broadcasters because if you can keep enough viewers week after week focused on whatever is that next "flaming ant epidemic" (e.g., a congressman’s sexual indiscretions, [[conspiracy theories]] about the president's birth certificate and other examples related to [[politainment]]), you can boost audience ratings and sell ads at higher rates&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin’s, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For women ===
Historically, the term ''infotainment'' was used to discredit woman journalists who were assigned soft news jobs. Soft news was expected to be consumed by only women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HemsBuz3kqkC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=infotainment+women+journalists-Car.+-cars#v=onepage&amp;q=infotainment+women+journalists-Car.+-cars&amp;f=false|title=Portraits of American Women: From Settlement to the Present|first=G. J.|last=Barker-Benfield|date=16 October 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780195120486}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually, thanks to the presence of more women in the news force and the changing media landscape, it became the norm of news media in general.&lt;ref name="thecut.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/05/how-barbara-walters-invented-the-internet.html|title=How Barbara Walters Invented the Internet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==&lt;!-- Note: [[Hard news]] redirects here --&gt;

Some define "journalism" only as reporting on "serious" subjects, where common [[journalistic standards]] are upheld by the reporter. Others believe that the larger "news business" encompasses everything from professional journalism to so-called "[[soft news]]" and "infotainment", and support activities such as [[marketing]], [[advertising]] sales, finance and delivery. Nevertheless, a differentiation of the two concepts of "hard news" and "soft news" is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Reinemann, C., Stanyer, J., Scherr, S., &amp; Legnante, G. (2012). Hard and soft news: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings. Journalism, 13(2), 221-239. doi:10.1177/1464884911427803&lt;/ref&gt; Professional journalism is supposed to place more emphasis on [[research]], fact-checking, and the [[public interest]] than its "non-journalistic" counterparts.  Because the term "[[news]]" is quite broad, the terms "hard" and "soft" denote both a difference in respective standards for [[news value]], as well as for standards of conduct, relative to the professional ideals of [[journalistic standards|journalistic integrity]].

The idea of '''hard news''' embodies two [[orthogonal]] concepts:
* '''Seriousness:''' Politics, economics, crime, war, and disasters are considered serious topics, as are certain aspects of law, business, science, and technology.
* '''Timeliness:''' Stories that cover current events—the progress of a war, the results of a vote, the breaking out of a fire, a significant statement, the freeing of a prisoner, an economic report of note.
The logical opposite, '''soft news''' is sometimes referred to in a derogatory fashion as '''infotainment.'''
Defining features catching the most criticism include:
* '''The least serious subjects:''' Arts and entertainment, sports, lifestyles, "human interest", and celebrities.
* '''Not timely:''' There is no precipitating event triggering the story, other than a reporter's curiosity.

Timely events happen in less serious subjects—sporting matches, [[celebrity]] misadventures, movie releases, art exhibits, and so on.

There may also be serious reports which are not event-driven—coverage of important social, economic, legal, or technological trends— [[investigative reporting|investigative]] reports which uncover ongoing [[corruption]], [[pollution]], or immorality— or discussion of unsettled political issues without any special reason.  Anniversaries, holidays, the end of a year or season, or the end of the first 100 days of an administration, can make some stories time-sensitive, but provide more of an opportunity for reflection and analysis than any actual "news" to report.

The spectrum of "seriousness" and "importance" is not well-defined, and different media organizations make different tradeoffs.  "News you can use", a common marketing phrase highlighting a specific genre of journalism, spans the gray area.  Gardening tips and hobby "news" pretty clearly fall at the entertainment end.  Warnings about imminent natural disasters or acute domestic [[security threat]]s (such as air raids or terrorist attacks) are considered so important that broadcast media (even non-news channels) usually interrupt other programming to announce them.  A medical story about a new treatment for breast cancer, or a report about local [[ground water pollution]] might fall in between.  So might book reviews, or coverage of religion.  On the other hand, people frequently find hobbies and entertainment to be worthwhile parts of their lives and so "importance" on a personal level is rather [[subjectivity|subjective]].

== Entertainment and news crossovers ==

Infotainment is generally identified by its entertaining nature through the use of flashy graphics, fast-paced editing, music,  and the use sensationalism or satire. Popular examples include ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and shows that would not be classified as news earlier, such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/infotainment|title=infotainment - television program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infotainers ===
'''Infotainers''' are entertainers in infotainment media, such as [[news presenter|news anchors]] or satirists who cross the line between journalism (quasi-journalism) and entertainment. [[Barbara Walters]], was for many an infotainer [[icon]]. She pioneered the many techniques used in the Infotainment media today.&lt;ref name="thecut.com"/&gt; Other notable examples in the U.S. media are [[Jon Stewart]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O’Reilly]], [[Rachel Maddow]] and [[Geraldo Rivera]] among others.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

When [[Geraldo Rivera]] became the host of his own news-oriented talk show on [[CNBC]], others within the NBC organization voiced their protest, including [[Tom Brokaw]] who was reported to have threatened to quit.  Rivera had a notorious history as a "sleaze reporter" and daytime [[talk show]] host, where he and one or two others were representative of "[[Tabloid talk show]]s"; television seen to have little social value or redeeming intelligence, but still popular with viewers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Commodification==

The broadcast of important or interesting events was originally meant simply to inform society of local or international events for their own safety and awareness. However, local news broadcasters are more regularly commodifying local events to provoke [[titillation]] and entertainment in viewers. [[Commodification]] is known as the process by which material objects are turned into [[marketable]] goods with monetary (exchange) value.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken &amp; Cartwright, 1980: p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Essential qualities of human beings and their products are converted into commodities, into things for buying and selling on the market,&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity fetishism in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; just as entertaining stories are sold to buy the attention of viewers.

Commodity fetishism is the process through which commodities are emptied of the meaning of their production (the labour that produced them and the context in which they were produced) and filled instead with the abstract meaning (usually through [[advertising]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sturken, M., and L. Cartwright. Practices of looking: An introduction to visual culture. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At their worst, the media's appetite for telling and selling stories leads them not only to document tragedy, but also to misrepresent or exploit it&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media &amp; culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin's, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As often seen in the news (with stories of extreme obesity or unusual deformities) present-day "infotainment" commodifies humans through their personal tragedies or [[scandal]]s, providing entertainment and titillation to public viewers.

==Social media implications==

The topic of news media today being more commonly considered “infotainment” has increased with the growing popularity and use of [[social media]] applications. These popular social media outlets are what German theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] would define as the "[[public sphere]]". According to Habermas, it defines a [[social space]] (which may be virtual) in which citizens come together to debate and discuss the present issues of their society. The term has been used more recently in the plural to refer to the multiple public spheres in which people debate contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the case of social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]], which were originally created for the purpose of connecting, re-connecting and sharing personal thoughts and information with public, they have now provided a new medium for the spread of "infotainment" and exploitation of public matters. There is no doubt that these social media websites are dominating, and what is so pressing about the matter is the fact that alongside cell phone technology, these ways of [[online communication]] are becoming prominent to the simple relaying of informative news. Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], and in so doing it obscures its roots.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity [[fetishism]] in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The public society are relying more frequently on [[television]] [[news broadcasting]] and now social media outlets to obtain a mixture of information and entertainment updates which are known as "infotainment."

==Origin==
The terms "infotainment" and "infotainer" were first used in September 1980 at the '''Joint Conference of Aslib''', the '''Institute of Information Scientists and the Library Association''' in [[Sheffield]], UK.  The Infotainers were a group of British information scientists who put on comedy shows at their professional conferences between 1980 and 1990.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  In 1983, infotainment began to see more popular usage &lt;ref name="dictionary.com"/&gt;
Around this time, infotainment gradually began to replace soft news with communications theorists.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

An earlier, and slightly variant term, "infortainment" was coined in 1974 as the title of the 1974 convention of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS), the association of college radio stations in the United States. It took place on April 5–7, 1974, at the Statler Hilton Hotel, now the Hotel Pennsylvania. It was defined as the "nexus between Information and Entertainment".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

{{nihongo|'''''Jump'''''|ジャンプ|Janpu}}, sometimes stylized '''''JUMP''''', is a line of [[manga magazines]] created by [[Shueisha]]. It began with '''''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shōnen Jump]]''''' [[manga magazine]] in 1968, later renamed ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''. The origin of the name is unknown. The ''Jump'' magazines are intended for the male audience, although the ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' magazine has also been popular to the female demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-04-10/oricon-no.1-manga-mag-for-japanese-girls-is-cite-shonen-jump/cite |title=Oricon: #1 Manga Mag for Japanese Girls Is…Shonen Jump - Anime News Network |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |work=Oricon: #1 Manga Mag for Japanese Girls Is…Shonen Jump |date=2007-04-10 |author=|accessdate=2008-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the line of [[manga]] magazines, ''Jump'' also includes a crossover [[media franchise]], where there have been various ''Jump'' themed crossover [[anime]] and [[Template:Jump crossover video games|video games]] (since ''[[Famicom Jump]]'') which bring together various [[List of series run in Weekly Shōnen Jump|''Shōnen Jump'' manga characters]].

== History ==
In 1949, Shueisha got into the business of making manga magazines, the first being ''Omoshiro Book''.&lt;ref name="History 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history2.html |title=集英社 小史｜成長期 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |work=Shueisha history 2 |date=|author=|accessdate=2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Shueisha created a female version of that anthology entitled ''Shōjo Book''.&lt;ref name="History 3" /&gt; ''Shōjo Book'' led to the publication of the highly successful [[Shōjo]] manga magazine: ''[[Ribon]]''.&lt;ref name="History 3" /&gt; ''Omoshiro Book'' went out of print and Shueisha decided to make another male version of their successful ''Shōjo Book'' to even it out and made the magazine ''Shōnen Book''.&lt;ref name="History 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history3.html |title=集英社 小史｜成長期 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |work=Shueisha history 3 |date=|author=|accessdate=2008-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of ''Shōnen Book's'' publication, ''Shōnen Jump'' began its run (at the time was a Semiweekly magazine and had no "Weekly").&lt;ref name="History 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history4.html |title=集英社 小史｜成長期 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |work=Shueisha history 4 |date=|author=|accessdate=2008-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shōnen Book'' ended when ''Shōnen Jump'' became a Weekly magazine correctly changing its name to ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''.&lt;ref name="History 4" /&gt; In 1969 a special issue called ''Bessatsu Shōnen Jump'' took ''Shōnen Book's'' place.&lt;ref name="History 4" /&gt; In addition to the success of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'', Shueisha created a [[Seinen]] version of the magazine in 1979, called ''[[Weekly Young Jump|Young Jump]]'' (now ''Weekly Young Jump'').&lt;ref name="History 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history5.html |title=集英社 小史｜成長期 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |work=Shueisha history 5 |date=|author=|accessdate=2008-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bessatsu Shōnen Jump'', later got renamed ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' and became a magazine of its own.&lt;ref name="History 4" /&gt; The seasonal issues of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' are now called ''Akamaru Jump''.

'''Legend''' is a [[Folklore genre|genre of folklore]] that consists of a [[narrative]] featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale [[verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilitude]]. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of "possibility," but may include [[miracle]]s. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh, vital, and [[realism (arts)|realistic]]. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Folkloristics |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=United States of America |isbn=0-253-32934-5 |pages=7 |author=Georges, Robert; Owens, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] defined legend as [[Folklore|folktale]] historically grounded.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Krapf, ''Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia'' (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the [[genre]] of legend from other narrative forms, such as [[fairy tale]]; he "reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded", according to Hans Sebald's review in ''German Studies Review'' '''13'''.2 (May 1990), p 312.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern [[folklore|folklorist]]'s professional definition of ''legend'' was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:&lt;ref&gt;Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390) p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, specifically located in place and time.&lt;/ref&gt; historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
[[File:Holger danske.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Holger Danske]], a legendary character]]

''Legend'' is a [[loanword]] from [[Old French]] that entered English usage circa 1340. The Old French noun ''legende'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''legenda''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. "legend"&lt;/ref&gt; In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word ''legendary'' was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{OEtymD|legendary|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|legendry}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word changed to ''legendry'', and ''legendary'' became the adjectival form.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

By 1613, English-speaking [[Protestant]]s began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any [[saint]] not acknowledged in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'') was fictitious. Thus, ''legend'' gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "[[wikt:spurious|spurious]]", which distinguish it from the meaning of ''[[chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson. ''Elizabethans'', "Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs" 2003:151–77, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', 1985, examines the "Renaissance verdict" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic [[hagiography]] in general.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[Jacob Grimm]] described the [[fairy tale]] as "poetic, legend historic."&lt;ref&gt;''Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer'', quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371)&lt;/ref&gt; Early scholars such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Wehrhan|2=de|3=Karl Wehrhan|preserve=1}}&lt;ref&gt;Wehrhan ''Die Sage'' (Leipzig) 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Ranke]]&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagen Forshung", in Leander Petzoldt (ed.), ''Vergleichende Sagenforschung'' 1971:1–20, noted by Tangherlini 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Will Erich Peuckert]]&lt;ref&gt;Peuckert , ''Sagen'' (Munich: E Schmidt) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;This was stimulated in part, Tangherlini suggests, by the 1962 congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research.&lt;/ref&gt; by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.

In an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Ranke|2=de|3=Friedrich Ranke|preserve=1}} in 1925&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagenforschung", ''Niederdeutsche Zeitschrift für Volkskunde'' '''3''' (1925, reprinted 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content"  a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Perdue Jt., reviewing [[Linda Dégh]] and Andrew Vászony's essay "The crack on the red goblet or truth and the modern legend" in Richard M. Dorson, ed. ''Folklore in the Modern World'', (The Hague: Mouton)1978, in ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''93''' No. 369 (July–September 1980:367), remarked on Ranke's definition, criticised in the essay, as a "dead issue". A more recent examination of the balance between oral performance and literal truth at work in legends forms Gillian Bennett's chapter "Legend: Performance and Truth" in Gillian Bennett and Paul Smith, eds. ''Contemporary Legend'' (Garland) 1996:17–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, [[Helmut de Boor]] noted in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;de Boor, "Märchenforschung", ''Zeitschrift für Deutschkunde'' '''42''' 1928:563–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry [[irony]] of folktale;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lutz Röhrich]], ''Märchen und Wirklichkeit: Eine volkskundliche Untersuchung'' (Wiesbaden: Steiner Verlag) 1956:9–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Heiske&lt;ref&gt;Heiske, "Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer: Versuch einer Kritik", ''Deutschunterricht'''''14''' 1962:69–75..&lt;/ref&gt; remarked on the similarity of [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic [[Literary mode|mode]], legend is not more historical than folktale.

In ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft'' (1928), [[Ernst Bernheim]] asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding [[rumour]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernheim, ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft''(Berlin: de Gruyter) 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;&lt;ref&gt;Allport, ''The Psychology of Rumor'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart) 1947:164.&lt;/ref&gt; thus "[[Urban legend]]s" are a feature of rumour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt af Klintberg]], "Folksägner i dag" ''Fataburen'' 1976:269–96.&lt;/ref&gt; When Willian Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends" and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, "Legend: oral tradition in the modern experience", ''Folklore Today, A Festschrift for William Dorson'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press) 1972:265–72, noted in Tangherlini 1990:375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ''legenda''==
{{main article|Legendary material in Christian hagiography}}

In the narrow Christian sense, ''legenda'' ("things to be read [on a certain day, in church]") were [[hagiographical]] accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, ''legend'', in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains [[supernatural]], divine or fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09121a.htm ''Literary or Profane Legends'']. Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
[[File:MataGrifone.jpg|thumb|Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the streets of [[Messina]], Italy, the second week of August, according to a legend are founders of the Sicilian city.]]
[[File:Hübner Bürkner Genoveva.jpg|thumb|The mediaeval legend of [[Genevieve of Brabant]] connected her to [[Treves]].]]

[[Hippolyte Delehaye]] distinguished legend from [[mythology|myth]]: "The ''legend'', on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/delehaye-legends.html Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'' (1907)], Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'',  [[Washington Irving]] transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with [[Gothic novel|"Gothic" overtones]], which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Stories that exceed the boundaries of "[[Realism (arts)|realism]]" are called "[[fable]]s". For example, the [[talking animal]] formula of [[Aesop]] identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a [[donkey]] that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea'' or "The Golden Legend" comprises a series of ''vitae'' or instructive  biographical narratives, tied to the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of [[hagiography]]. The ''Legenda'' was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the [[saint]] of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy R. Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390).

==Urban legend==
[[File:Union Graveyard II.jpg|thumb|The tale of the White Lady who haunts Union Cemetery is a variant of the [[Vanishing hitchhiker]] legend.]]
{{main|Urban legend}}

The [[vanishing hitchhiker]] is the best-known [[urban legend]] in America, traceable as far back as 1870, but it is found around the world including in Korea and Russia. In the legend, a young girl in a white dress picked up alongside of the road by a passerby. The unknown girl in white remains silent for the duration of her ride, thanks the driver, and quietly gets out at her destination. When the driver turns to look back, the girl has vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Gillian. (1998). ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker at Fifty-Five''. ''[[Western Folklore]]''.

A '''marathon''' is an event in which viewers or readers engage many hours-worth of [[Media (communication)|media]] (film, television, books, [[YouTube]] videos etc.) in a condensed time period. This phrase represents a two-fold shift from binge-watch in that it incorporates other media (not just television) and it reduces the negative connotations associated with bingeing. In the 2014 book ''Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality,'' Lisa Perks describes media marathoning as a “comprehensive and complimentary phrase” that “connotes a conjoined triumph of commitment and stamina. This phrase also captures viewers’ or readers’ engrossment, effort, and sense of accomplishment surrounding their media interaction.” &lt;ref&gt;Perks, Lisa. (2014). [https://www.amazon.com/Media-Marathoning-Lisa-Glebatis-Perks/dp/073919674X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421957994&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=media+marathoning Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality]. Lexington Books, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] Executive Todd Yellin is quoted as saying "I don't like the term 'binge,' because it sounds almost pathological. 'Marathon' sounds more celebratory."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Jurgensen. (July 13, 2013). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577521300806686174 Binge Viewing: TV's Lost Weekends.] ''The Wall Street Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Media marathons can be organized around particular series, particular artists (e.g., [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] or [[Hitchcock]]), or genres (e.g., [[horror films]] or [[chick flicks]]). Marathons can be user-created: one person decides to undertake a marathon solo or to organize a group marathon. Marathons may also be producer-created. Producer-created marathons are usually orchestrated by movie theaters, fan sites, or by cable channels that show already-run seasons, and, more recently, with original first-run programming through streaming services (such as Netflix's ''House of Cards''). In television, a marathon is an extension of the concept of [[block programming]].

==Reasons==
The most common reasons for a network to run a marathon are:
# to celebrate the acquisition of a series,
# to lead into a highly anticipated episode of a series (such as a return from a hiatus or a series finale),
# likewise to allow viewers to catch up on a series before a season finale,
# when well known star of a show retires or dies (this is particularly popular on networks that specialize in [[rerun]]s),
# to celebrate (or to take advantage of additional viewers on) a [[holiday]],
# to [[burning off|burn off]] a contract for a television series that has proved unprofitable
# to [[stunting (broadcasting)|signal the end of a channel format and/or the start of a new one]], or 
# to inexpensively [[counterprogramming|counterprogram]] against more popular programs such as the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name=usatoday-bowls2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Football not your thing? Tee up these televised 'bowls'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-01-29-super-bowl-alternatives_N.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=30 January 2013|first=Bruce|last=Schwartz|date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To celebrate the anniversary of a tv series.

Marathons are attractive to genre movie fans, or families that like watching their favourite movies/TV shows in blocks at a time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning Your Family Staycation: Fun Ideas for Your At-Home Summer Vacation|author=Witmer, D.D.|isbn=9781105601156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJiiAwAAQBAJ|page=126|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On July 1st, 1985, the first TV marathons were broadcast on Nickelodeon's [[Nick at Nite]], presenting multiple episodes from ''Donna Reed'' and ''Route 66''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slevinski|first1=Christy|title=CLASSIC MOVE: NICK AT NITE MARKS A DECADE|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/classic-move-nick-nite-marks-decade-article-1.682035|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The idea by [[Alan Goodman]] and [[Fred Seibert]] was based on a similar concept that radio stations used, in which songs by one particular artist would be played for a prolonged period of time. While early marathons were rare and special, in modern time it is common for some networks to air a television series in three- to four-hour blocks, sometimes on a daily basis, mainly to appeal to and compete with subscription video on demand services (such as [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix]]) that have enabled voluntary "[[Binge-watching]]" of television series.

Almost all marathons primarily feature [[rerun]]s of episodes already previously broadcast, although one may be used to lead into the premiere of a new episode. On the other hand, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] used a marathon for the series premiere of ''[[Angie Tribeca]]'', broadcasting its entire first season of 10 episodes in a 25-hour marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/tbs-wants-you-spend-25-hours-angie-tribeca-227988|title=TBS wants you to spend 25 hours with Angie Tribeca|last=McLevy|first=Alex|work=The A.V. Club|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, especially with classic television, [[lost episode]]s, originally unseen [[television pilot]]s, and other programming that may not have been seen during the show's original run may be included.

Marathons have proven to be a viable way of rerunning reality television contests, which have otherwise been relatively difficult to rerun in traditional forms (e.g. daily "strip" syndication) because of the loss of the element of surprise. In December 2012, MTV announced that it would air a seven-day (168-hour) marathon of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' before the series finale on December 20, 2012; this marked one of the longest marathons in television history.

It has been speculated in the early 2010s that marathon television viewing or [[binge watching]], usually done on-demand by ordering a whole season of episodes of a television series on a service such as [[Netflix]], is increasing in popularity. [[Infomercial]] blocks are generally not considered marathons beyond jocular mentions of such for networks such as [[CNBC]] which program heavy infomercial schedules on weekends or financially struggling stations which schedule them in high-profile time periods.

Perks attributes the contemporary marathoning trend to three factors: advances in content-delivery technologies, active audience behaviors, and increasing complexity of storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Perks, Lisa (2014). ''[https://www.amazon.com/Media-Marathoning-Lisa-Glebatis-Perks/dp/073919674X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421954322&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=media+marathoning Media Marathoning: Immersions in Morality].'' Lexington Books, pp. xv-xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2015, [[Comedy Central]] announced that it would stream a marathon online of every episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], known as "Your Month of Zen", running between June 26 and August 6, 2015, in honor of his retirement.&lt;ref name=thewrap-jonvoyage&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart to Get Month-Long Send Off From Comedy Central|url=http://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-to-get-month-long-send-off-from-comedy-central/|website=TheWrap|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have operationally defined media marathoning and binge-watching in different ways. Perks provides medium-specific definitions. Marathoners must have "viewed a television season in a week or less, watched three or more films from the same series in a week or less, or read three or more books from the same series in a month or less."&lt;ref&gt;Perks, 2014, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; A Netflix-commissioned study defined "binge-watching" as viewing 2-6 episodes of the same show in one sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stelter, “[http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/13/technology/netflix-binge/index.html Netflix Finds Plenty of Binge Watching, but Little Guilt],” CNN Money, December 13, 2013, accessed December 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 TiVo survey defined binge-watching as watching 3 or more episodes of the same show in one day.&lt;ref&gt;Dina Gachman, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dinagachman/2014/06/25/breaking-bad-house-of-cards-most-binge-watched-shows/ “Breaking Bad, House of Cards Most Binge-Watched Shows,”] Forbes, June 25, 2014, accessed July 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In extreme media marathons, such as the Simpsons Marathon (which lasted 86 hours and 37 minutes), the viewing time can last an exceptionally long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Simpsons-Marathon-Winners-Tied-86-Hours-37-Minutes-39556.html|title=Simpsons Marathon Winners: Tied at 86 Hours, 37 Minutes|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=cinemablend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the longest running marathons are the two ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' marathons that air on [[Syfy]] in the United States on [[New Years Day]] and [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]; not counting early morning [[infomercials]], each run for roughly three days straight. Holidays are a common time for marathons; for instance, on [[Thanksgiving]] in 2010, over 40 cable networks aired marathons of various lengths.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

For a time, the longest continuous marathon in the history of television was a twelve-day marathon of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' that aired on [[FXX]], which aired non-stop from August 21, 2014 until September 2, 2014.&lt;ref name=EverySimpsonsEver&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Bill|title='The Simpsons' Launches On FXX With Longest Continuous Marathon Ever|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/simpsons-launches-on-fxx-longest-marathon_n_5120709.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marathon featured the first 552 episodes of the series (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled those of regular prime time programming for FXX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title=‘The Simpsons’ Marathon More Than Triples Primetime Audience for FXX|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-simpsons-marathon-more-than-triples-primetime-audience-for-fxx-1201288542/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=FXX Paints Labor Day Weekend Yellow|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/08/28/fxx-paints-labor-day-weekend-yellow/297657/|publisher=[[TV By the Numbers]]|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The record was surpassed in 2015 by [[VH1 Classic]], which broadcast a fifteen-day marathon of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''-related programming from January 28 to February 15, in honour of the program's 40th season (with its end date coinciding with the [[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special|40th anniversary special episode]] on NBC). The marathon primarily featured the series' most notable episodes in a reverse chronological order (beginning with [[Saturday Night Live (season 39)|season 39]] and concluding with its October 11, 1975 series premiere), along with blocks focusing on specific celebrities (such as [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]), a block of the program's retrospective episodes on February 15, as well as Saturday-night airings of films featuring alumni of the series (such as ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' and'' [[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7546265/snl-marathon-vh1-classic|title=VH1 Classic will run the "longest-ever" TV marathon with 19 days of Saturday Night Live|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/vh1-classic-to-run-433-hour-saturday-night-live-marathon-1201404896/|title=VH1 Classic To Run 433-Hour ‘Saturday Night Live’ Marathon|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2015-01-14|work=Variety|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Master of Ceremonies (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Benoit xvi octobre 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Monsignor]] [[Guido Marini]] (left), the Master of Ceremonies for Pontifical Liturgy, assisting at a [[Papal Mass]] with [[Pope Benedict XVI]].]]
A '''master of ceremonies''', abbreviated '''MC''' or '''emcee''', also called '''compère''' and '''announcer''', and '''microphone controller''' is the official host of a [[ceremony]], staged event or similar performance.

The term is earliest documented in the [[Catholic Church]] since the 5th century, where the Master of Ceremonies was and still is an official of the [[Papal Court]] responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elegant and elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred [[Catholic liturgy|liturgy]].

The master of ceremonies sometimes also refers to the [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] officer during an official state function, especially in [[monarchies]].

Today, the term (for a male or its female equivalent: Commere) often connotes a master of ceremonies who presents performers, speaks to the audience, entertains people, and generally keeps a contemporary event moving. This usage occurs in the [[Show business|entertainment industry]], including for television [[game show]] hosts, as well as in contemporary [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music]] culture, where "MC" refers to [[Rapping|rap]] artists or performers who perform vocals for their own original material.

In addition, the term also exists in various [[chivalric order]]s and [[fraternal order]]s.

== Catholic Church ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
The term originated in the [[Catholic Church]]. The Master of Ceremonies is an official of the [[Papal Court]] responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elegant and elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred [[liturgy]]. He may also be an official involved in the proper conduct of protocols and ceremonials involving the [[Roman Pontiff]], the [[Roman Curia|Papal Court]], and other dignitaries and potentates. Examples of official [[liturgical book]]s prescribing the rules and regulations of [[liturgical celebrations]] are ''[[Cæremoniale Romanum]]'' and ''[[Cæremoniale Episcoporum]]''.

The office of the Master of Ceremonies itself is very old. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], the most ancient ceremonials and rituals of the Catholic Church are the ''[[Ordines Romani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03538a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ceremonial |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names of Masters of Ceremonies are known since the late Middle Ages (15th century) and the [[Renaissance]] (16th century). However, copies of books prescribing the forms of rituals, rites and customs of pontifical ceremonies are known to have been given to [[Charles Martel]] in the 8th century. The rules and rituals themselves are known to have been compiled or written by the pontifical masters of ceremonies, dating back to the time of [[Pope Gelasius I]] (492–496)  with modifications and additions made by [[Pope Gregory the Great]] (590–604). It is reasonable to assume that the ceremonials themselves pre-date Gelasius. The duties of the Master of Ceremonies may have developed from the time Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] gave the [[Lateran Palace]] to the popes (324) or from the time Christianity became the official religion of the [[Roman Empire]] (380), and were no doubt influenced by imperial practices, customs and norms. However, documentary evidence from the late Roman period is scarce or lost. The ceremonies and practices of the Byzantine emperors are also known to have influenced the papal court. The accumulation of elaborations and complications since the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] eras continued well into the 20th century, until some of the ceremonies (i.e. the court, the rituals and norms) were simplified or completely eliminated by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1970s after [[Vatican II]]; much of the Renaissance pomp and ceremony has been completely abandoned by the popes of the modern era.

At a large Catholic church or cathedral, the Master of Ceremonies organizes and rehearses the proceedings and ritual of each [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He may also have responsibility for the physical security of the place of worship during the liturgy. At major festivities such as Christmas and Easter, when the liturgies are long and complex, the Master of Ceremonies plays a vital role in ensuring that everything runs smoothly.
 	
The current papal Master of Ceremonies is Monsignor [[Guido Marini]], who succeeded Archbishop [[Piero Marini]] (to whom he is not related).

== Monarchies ==
[[File:Master of Ceremonies (Persia).jpg|thumb|"Master of Ceremonies". from the book ''[[:s:Persia|Persia]]'' by [[Frederic Shoberl]], 1828]]
Historically certain European [[royal court]]s maintained senior offices known as Masters of Ceremonies (or some variant thereof), responsible for conducting stately ceremonies such as [[coronation]]s and receptions of foreign ambassadors. Examples included:

* Spanish Empire: [[Maestro de Ceremonias]]
* British Empire: [[Master of the Ceremonies]]
* France: [[Grand Master of Ceremonies]]
* Japan: [[Master of Ceremonies (Japan)|Master of Ceremonies]]&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Household Agency: [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-kunaicho/soshiki.html Organization and Functions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Russian Empire: see [[Table of Ranks]]
* Ottoman Empire: [[Kapıcıbaşı]], literally "chief doorkeeper" of the [[Topkapi Palace]]

== Orders ==
The function is prevalent in the culture of [[chivalric order]]s, as well as in more modern [[fraternal order]]s, such as [[Freemasons]] and [[Odd Fellows]].

== Corporate ==
Most large Corporate &amp; Association conferences and conventions use an MC to keep the events running smoothly. This role is sometimes performed by someone inside the group but usually by an outside professional expert MC. Their role could include - introducing and thanking speakers, introducing the theme of the conference, facilitating a [[panel discussion]] &amp; interviewing guests.&lt;ref name="What is a Corporate MC and what do they do?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Corporate MC and what do they do?|url=http://expertmc.com/new-start-here/|website=expertmc.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weddings ==
During the [[wedding reception]], the multifaceted responsibility of the Master of Ceremony (MC) is to keep the agenda flowing smoothly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.musiconthestrand.com/MasterOfCeremonies.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195602/http://www.musiconthestrand.com/MasterOfCeremonies.html | archivedate=2016-03-04| work=Music on the Strand's DJ ENTERTAINMENT| publisher= Music on the Strand| location= Myrtle Beach, Florida, USA|  title= Wedding Master of Ceremonies| accessdate= 2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; by:

* skillfully capturing and maintaining the attention of the wedding guests
* effectively directing their attention on whatever the bride and groom have chosen to include
* keeping the wedding attendees informed so at any given moment they know what is happening
* comfortably guiding the bride's and groom's friends and family so they know what they are supposed to do to participate

The role of the Wedding Master of Ceremony incorporates a wide range of skills, and those who serve in this capacity have frequently undergone extensive training in the following areas:

* Delivering applause cues
* Presenting introductions
* Microphone technique
* Posture and stance
* Voice [[inflection]]
* [[Staging (theatre)]]

Masters of Ceremonies at weddings and private events also ensure the coordination of their event, including liaison with catering staff.

=== Hip hop ===
{{main|Rapping}}
In the late 1970s, the term '''emcee''', '''MC''' or '''M.C.''',&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|emcee|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daveyd.com/historyemceegmcaz.html|title=The Emcee[MC]  Master of Ceremonies to Mic Controller by Gradmaster Caz|website=www.daveyd.com|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an alternative title for a [[Rapping|rapper]] and for their role within [[hip hop music]] and culture. However, initially M.C.s (Masters of Ceremony) were those who introduced the [[Disc jockey|DJ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to the crowd and explained what was taking place during the event. Often these events were parties at locations such as clubs or outdoor public spaces. The term is often used as a term of distinction, referring to an artist with good performance skills.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxii"&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  An MC focuses on skills, lyrical ability, and subject matter. Performers using "MC" in their stage names include:

* [[Father MC]], the stage name for American rapper Timothy Brown
* [[MC Breed]], the stage name for American rapper Eric Breed
* [[MC Chris]], the stage name for American rapper Christopher Brendan Ward
* [[MC Eiht]], the stage name for American rapper Aaron Tyler
* [[MC Frontalot]], the stage name for American rapper Damian Hess
* [[MC Hammer]], the stage name for American rapper Stanley Kirk Burrell
* [[MC HotDog]], the stage name for Taiwanese rapper Yao Chung-jen
* [[MC Jin]], the stage name for Hong Kong American rapper Jin Au-Yeung
* [[MC Lyte]], the stage name for American rapper Lana Michele Moorer
* [[MC Ren]], the stage name for American rapper Lorenzo Jerald Patterson
* [[Young MC]], the stage name for English rapper Marvin Young
* [[MC Magic]], the stage name for Mexican rapper Marco Cardenas
* [[MC Ride]], the stage name for American rapper Stefan Corbin Burnett
* [[Adam Yauch|MCA]], the stage name for American rapper Adam Nathaniel Yauch


=== Comedy clubs ===
{{see also|Warm-up comedian}}
In the context of a [[comedy club]], the role of MC is traditionally filled by a "compère". In any comedy show, the compère is the host of the evening's events, but the precise role and responsibilities will vary depending on the country, venue and style of event. The compère is usually a working comedian, and whilst they may incorporate elements of their regular set, the role broadly requires a greater level of improvisation – creating a sense of place and community, interacting with the audience, dealing with any [[heckler]]s and encouraging them to focus on the other acts.  The compère will normally do longer bits at the start of the show and after any interval, and shorter bits between acts. They may also be required to make announcements, such as birthdays, anniversaries and bar promotions.

==Other==
{{expand section|date=October 2016}}
In some circles the title "Master of Ceremonies" is also known as "Minister of Ceremonies."

In the 1940 Disney film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Deems Taylor]] is the film's Master of Ceremonies.

In the role-playing game ''[[Apocalypse World]]'', the game master is named Master of Ceremonies (MC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Apocalypse World|last=Baker|first=D. Vincent|publisher=Lumpley Games|year=2010|isbn=978-0976904212|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
&lt;!--Irrelevant paragraph: During the nineteenth century, the racial politics of imitation towards African Americans influenced the term mimesis and its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Kirt|title=The Racial Politics of Imitation in the Nineteenth Century|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=2003|doi=10.1080/00335630308178}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge''''' ('''''MXC''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[comedy]] [[television]] program that aired on [[Paramount Network|Spike TV]] from 2003 to 2007. It is a re-purpose of footage from the [[Japan]]ese [[game show]] ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'' which originally aired in Japan from 1986 to 1990. The re-purposed "MXC" created a completely new premise, storyline and characters.   The MXC re-purpose created two teams competing against each other à la a typical Saturday afternoon network football game broadcast, with players trying to win points for their teams by surviving through different challenges.  In the original program the Count and his underlings would follow the progress of the players as they moved through the course. In the re-purpose Count Takeshi became veteran network announcer Vic Romano and the count's flunky became young upstart Kenny Blankenship. 

''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'' was created and produced by RC Entertainment, Inc. (Paul Abeyta and Peter Kaikko) in Los Angeles, California and Larry Strawther (a writer and producer on a number of network sitcoms).  The three were friends who had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s. Strawther was the staff on the ''[[Dance Fever]]'' pilot which Abeyta took over as Executive Producer the following season, while Strawther stayed with ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. Between jobs they would occasionally try to create their own projects. One of these was the 1990s talk show spoof ''[[Night Stand with Dick Dietrick]]''.  MXC is the property of both Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) and RC Entertainment. The 2004 special episode ''MXC Almost Live'' is the property of Viacom International, which was filmed in [[Orlando, Florida]] by the producers of ''MXC''.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge episodes}}
{{:List of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge episodes}}

The premise of ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'' (as distinct from ''Takeshi's Castle'') is a game show that is hosted by the eccentric characters Vic Romano (Vic Wilson) and Kenny Blankenship (Chris Darga), along with the field marshal Captain Tenneal ([[John Cervenka]]) and the field reporter Guy LeDouche ([[John Cervenka]]). The announcer ([[John Cervenka]]) would begin each episode with this standard introduction. 

{{Quote|"''What are these people running from? They're not! They're running TO the World's Toughest Competition in Town!''"}}

When the show was transitioning away from its full name, it briefly added "''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!''" to the end of the opening.

Eventually the opening introduction was changed to:

{{Quote|"''Get fired up for MXC! The world's most toughest competition in town!''"}}

Usually, two or three teams of contestants compete in several turn-based and head-to-head challenges. The only episode done without a competitive team base was the first episode ever made, which was simply centered around the stereotypical antics of college girls. Even though this was the first episode made,&lt;ref&gt;DVD Audio Commentary for Season 1, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; it was the seventh episode of season one to air. Most other competitive teams do not truly have a real-life rivalry (e.g., Season 1, Episode 2 "Donors vs Addicts"), while others such as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] vs [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] vs [[Third party (politics)|Third Party]] do.

The contestants compete in a variety of challenges, usually four per episode, but occasionally as many as six. The challenges are extremely hard, and a majority of the contestants fail to complete the challenges. Throughout the show, painful failures to complete challenges are reviewed by Vic and Kenny in the "''MXC'' Impact Replay" (briefly given sponsor names like the "Snickers Satisfies Replay" and the "[[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jim]] Snap of the Day"), which is essentially a sports-themed playback feature. Occasionally, the Impact Replay is used for Kenny's pleasure, in looking at the female contestants, items, or random events in the series which he finds funny or disappointing. Contestants who do complete a challenge earn one or two points for their team (maybe even more). The team with the most points at the end of the episode wins the competition. At the end of each episode, Kenny counts down the ten "Most Painful Eliminations of the Day", which usually focus on the events shown in the Impact Replay, but sometimes includes random events that involved the main or recurring characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Kenny and Vic, along with any other people around them at the end of the show, all end the episode by saying: "Don't get eliminated!"

===''MXC Almost Live'' and other special episodes===
On April 22, 2004, Spike TV aired a special edition of the show to start the third season, featuring [[skateboard]]er [[Tony Hawk]] and [[snowboard]]er [[Tara Dakides]]. The special was taped at the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] using students from nearby colleges and appropriately dubbed '''''MXC Almost Live'''''. The special edition is not based on the original ''Takeshi's Castle'' footage, but only has some added in for Vic, Ken, the Captain, and Guy LeDouche. Actors were hired to play those who would replace the roles of the latter two, named "Major Babe" (Michelle Sorrell) and "Gip LeDouche" (Eric Esteban). While everyone in the episode is American, everything said by any contestants besides Hawk and Dakides is still dubbed.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Three other special episodes aired, all from Season 2, including a special nighttime episode, a "Monsters vs. Mascots" episode, and a special winter episode.

Spike initially held a contest in 2005 or 2006 where the winner would have his name and the name of five of his friends used in an episode of MXC and would also receive a viewing party of said episode for up to 50 people at a place of his choice.  However, this contest never fully materialized and is assumed to have been canceled for unknown reasons.

==Characters==
''Most of the characters and contestants on MXC are voiced by the producers and series' writers: Victor Wilson, Christopher Darga, [[John Cervenka]], and [[Mary Scheer]] who did all of the female voices.''{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

*'''Vic Romano''' (Victor Wilson provides his dub voice), is the co-host and play-by-play commentator. In Takeshi's Castle, Vic's character is Count Takeshi himself, the main character of the show. In MXC, Vic is level-headed, has a dark past of alcohol abuse, failed marriages, and various addictions, and generally treats ''MXC'' as a serious competition. Vic was once also a professional baseball player who became addicted to "everything", including every type of drug, alcohol, and easy women. He once was an airline pilot during his stint of alcohol abuse, but states: "Luckily, nobody noticed." Notable catchphrases include "Right you are, Ken!", "Indeed!", and "Kenny!", which is usually followed by him smacking Kenny's head with a paper fan, in response to Kenny's commentary of the action. The character is played by Japanese actor and movie director [[Takeshi Kitano]], who also created the original series MXC is based on, ''Takeshi's Castle.''
*'''Kenny Blankenship''' (Chris Darga provides the dub voice) is Vic's co-host and [[color commentator]]. Blankenship is a high-school dropout whose uncle owns the network. Kenny's character is very unprofessional about hosting, far less serious about the job than Vic's character is. Despite his non-professional, simplistic stand-point, he claims to make ten times the amount that Vic does because of his uncle being one of the network bosses. Kenny has also been stated to own a condo complex from all the money that he earns from hosting and drives a Volkswagen Jetta. During hosting, Kenny usually spends his time commenting on the sexual appeal of the female competitors and how much he likes beer, pizza and seeing the majority of competitors wipe out. Kenny's character was originally played by comedian [[Hideo Higashikokubaru|Sonomanma Higashi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*'''Captain Tenneal''' ([[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice), whose name comes from the 1970s musical act [[Captain &amp; Tennille]], is the field marshal who conducts the contestants through each challenge with a sharp "Get it on!" Near the beginning of each ''MXC'' episode, he is seen addressing the contestants as a group, asking whether some broad assertion relating to one of the topics in the episode is true. After the contestants raise their hands to show agreement, the Captain usually declares "Well, you're wrong!", but on one occasion, the "Cops vs. Cons" episode of Season 1, he actually agreed with the contestants. He'll sometimes defend his opinion by saying, "Of course I'm right, I'm the Captain!" After further explanation and give-and-take with individual contestants, he bellows "Let's Go!" and leads the contestants forward to begin playing the games. Captain Tenneal is played by [[Hayato Tani]].
*'''Guy LeDouche''' (pronounced "gee" as in "geezer"; [[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice) is the MXC field reporter. He is portrayed wearing a [[pith helmet]] and his personality is that of a flamboyant, perverted man of suggested [[France|French]] descent who has a questionable sexual orientation, as he makes passes to many of the contestants he interviews, regardless of gender. Some situations, which usually involve some violence directed at Guy, he will respond with, "Guy like!" In addition to this, he is seen to have a romantic interest in Captain Tenneal, always calling him "Skipper". He has other family member interviewers who show the same behavior, such as "Lyndon" (which plays off wacky political figure [[Lyndon LaRouche]]), "Geek", "Giddy", "Gip", "Goon", "Gawp", and "Gawk", along with females named "Gay", "Grandmama", "Gab", "Gin", "Gidget", and "Gal", with an unrelated reporter named Al Frankincense. Guy is played by [[Junji Inagawa]]. The family (and Al) is voiced by John Cervenka (male) and [[Mary Scheer]] (female).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Guy, and his family members, along with interviewing contestants, will also announce the games that will be played in each episode, and will sometimes explain one or more of the games' objectives.

===Recurring characters===
The following are characters who have established a semi-consistent name. However, their names may change to fit in with a show's theme or style of game.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

*''Danny Glands'' ([[John Cervenka]] provides the dub voice) (a play on the name of long-time [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] entertainer [[Danny Gans]]) is an ''MXC'' staffer who works in many of the games. His primary responsibilities include asking questions in ''Finger It'' (later renamed ''Hand Job''), knocking down contestants in ''Brass Balls'', and launching the soccer balls in ''Dirty Balls''. Also known as ''Jimmy Junk'', ''Sugar Ramos Phiss'', ''Golden Shower Boy'', ''Barry Sosa'', and ''Spin''. The original actor is early 1980s [[J-Pop]] star [[Michiru Jo]]; he is notably skinny, and his lack of appealing physique is often played for laughs, emphasized by his voice actor who adopts a nasal, nerdy tone.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Skanki'' is a {{convert|16|ft|m|0|sing=on}} samurai who punishes contestants that fail to complete the ''Wall Bangers'' game.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Chief Otto Parts'' (a parody of the [[Chief Auto Parts]] auto supply store chain) is an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] who taunts the contestants in ''Rotating Surfboard of Death''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*''Em on Em'' (a spoof of rapper [[Eminem]], as well as a play on the [[pornographic film]] term "m on m", or man on man) is an apparently gay set of twin [[rapper]]s dressed in [[rainbow]] ponchos and [[bowler hat]]s. Main games include ''Tumbling Dominos of Doom'' and ''Irritable Bowl Syndrome''. Also known as "Babe and Ruth" "Bud and Pud", and "Jessie and Jackson" among others. They are played by identical twins Shoji and Shoichi Kinoshita. In one of the episodes, there was a contestant named [[Eminem|Marshall Mathers]], the real name of Eminem.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
*The ''[[Baba ghanoush|Babaganoosh]] Family'' is a family of contestants from the [[Middle East]] who appear in nearly every episode. The last name "Babaganoosh" became a popular running gag throughout the series.  It comes from Chris Darga's Lebanese heritage where babaganoush is a popular entree.
*The ''Brown [[Spider]]'' taunts contestants in various games, including ''Wall Buggers'' and ''Dash to Death''. Usually played by [[Brad Lesley]] (also known as Brad Leslie).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_dpGH_ubik |title=Wall Bangers (Wall Buggers) 1 – Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash to Death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rVYpavgiF0 |title=The Best of the Best of MXC – Dash to Death |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Herbie the Steamy Pile'' is a strange, brown creature who taunts and sprays fallen contestants with a fire-extinguisher in ''Buck Off!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn_bY_eDptM |title=Buck Off 1 – Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Zygote Brothers'' are identical characters that appear in the game ''Dash to Death''. They attempt to distract the contestants and knock them into the water as they run through the obstacle course.&lt;ref name="Dash to Death"/&gt;
*''Sporky'' is a character featured in the game ''Dash to Death''. Hiding inside a jail cell near the "spinner" obstacle, Sporky taunts contestants as they pass by. If contestants fail in the area of the course around him, Sporky is usually credited with distracting the contestant into falling off the course.&lt;ref name="Dash to Death"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAW1WW33-vI |title=Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) – Top 25 Most Painful Eliminations of Season 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Diddler'' is a character exclusive to the game ''Little Man in the Boat''. If contestants don't go far enough on the course, The Diddler appears out of nowhere and pushes the contestant off and into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFYEv-RIKXM |title=Little Man in the Boat 1 – Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although uncredited, [[Jamie Alcroft]] was the announcer for the first four episodes of ''MXC'' before [[John Cervenka]] took over that role for the remainder of the series.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Production==
In the show, the contestants' names are usually names of celebrities, network bosses, or family members and friends of the producers or voice actors. Several recurring names appear in the show; the most common family name is ''Babaganoosh'', since the producers of ''MXC'' were given short deadlines for producing episodes, therefore giving them limited time to write the scripts. Babaganoosh comes from Darga as his family is from the Middle East, where [[Baba ghanoush]] is the name of a local eggplant dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 11th, 2012 |url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/03/baba-ganoush.html |title=The Grammarphobia Blog: The spicy history of baba ganoush |publisher=Grammarphobia.com |date=2012-03-11 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the production of the show, the network bosses stated that they did not want the producers to repeat games from episode to episode, but the producers ignored this, knowing 1) they didn't have the rights to enough episodes at the time to not repeat, but 2) some of the games (especially "Log Rollers" and "Sinkers or Floaters") to be interesting and funny every time.   Some fan-favorite and recurring games included ''Log Drop'', ''Wall Bangers'', ''Dope on a Rope'', ''Rotating Surfboard of Death'', and ''Sinkers and Floaters'', amongst many others. Due to the high viewership and popularity of ''MXC'' in the United States, several of the original Japanese actors whose acting careers were failing at the time ''MXC'' aired in the United States got massive career re-boots because of the U.S. fan base.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

While the basic premise of ''MXC'' is that of a legitimate game show, its true premise is that of a comedy not intended to be taken literally. All original audio was stripped from each show for legal reasons, and all audio was added by producer-writers and an audio technician, leaving none of the original audio from ''Takeshi's Castle.'' The script is completely unrelated to the original Japanese dialogue; Both Abeyta and Strawther's original notes deliberately avoided any references to Japanese or Asian culture.  The characters could be from Iowa.  Some thought the only Japanese-related, albeit loosely, term used for the show was the name ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'', which has a Japanese-like naming style. But Strawther noted that the title – pitched by Abeyta – was a spoof on network buying tendencies of the time – "Extreme sports were big and the term was being thrown around everywhere.  We thought it was funny to use "Most Extreme."  All the producers and writers admit that they had no knowledge of what the contestants or actors were originally saying during the filming of ''Takeshi's Castle''. ''MXC'''s early scripts spoofed [[popular culture|pop culture]], or mocked various celebrities, athletes, sports announcers, politicians, with the occasional sexual pun. In later seasons, with network encouragement, sexual puns and references took on a much larger role, to the dismay of some of the show's producers who felt the cheap jokes led to its demise earlier than necessary.  Contestants are given seemingly incongruous but humorous names and occupations based on their team and physical appearance (e.g. Sal Bloomberg from [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], a meat handler team member in the Season 1 episode "Meat Handlers vs. Cartoon Voice Actors", aka "Network Boss"). In addition, the various challenges are all given humorous names, such as ''Sinkers &amp; Floaters'' or ''Wall Bangers''. Any water or mud used in a challenge is given humorous names from Kenny and Vic, notably "septic sludge", with Kenny usually following it with a more specific name (e.g. "runoff from a local chili cook off").   The footage for a single episode of ''MXC'' can come from multiple episodes of ''Takeshi's Castle'', and occasionally the same footage, including challenges, will be used in multiple episodes with different character names and dialogue. Unlike international editions of ''Takeshi's Castle'', the original text that appeared on screen is left as is, with the characters often playing off of it.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Production Team Trivia: All four of the Producers / Performers / Writers on the series are alums of the famous ''[[Groundlings]]'' in Hollywood: [[John Cervenka]], Christopher Darga, [[Mary Scheer]], and Victor Wilson.  The creators/Exec Producers Paul Abeyta and Larry Strawther had worked together at Merv Griffin Productions in the late 1970s.  Strawther had worked on the company's pilots for the re-boot of [[Jeopardy!]] and [[Dance Fever]] in 1978.  When both shows sold Strawther went with Jeopardy as its head writer and Abeyta came over Merv's talk show to exec produce [[Dance Fever]]. Kaikko worked for Dance Fever's  distributor 20th-Century Fox and while overseeing that show he struck up a longtime friendship and business partnership with Abeyta. Strawther went on to write and produce network sitcoms, including ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'' and ''[[My Sister Sam]]'' and some movies like ''[[Without a Clue]]'', but between jobs he would work with Abeyta and Kaikko on spec projects that seemed like they would be fun.

==Lawsuits==
The American gameshow ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was accused of being "a blatant copycat" of shows such as ''Takeshi's Castle'' and ''Most Extreme Elimination Challenge'', and a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit was filed by Tokyo Broadcasting System against ABC in late 2008, claiming the obstacle-course game show closely resembled several Japanese shows. It alleged ''Wipeout'' violated its copyrights to shows such as ''Takeshi's Castle'' and ''[[Ninja Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211072527/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/081007/gnj0810071200020-n1.htm |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese network later sued Dutch entertainment giant [[Endemol]], which produces ''Wipeout''.

The companies settled the case on November 30, 2011, after meeting with a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles. No settlement terms were filed with the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wipeout-copyright-lawsuit-abc-endemol-276301 |title=ABC, Endemol Settle 'Wipeout' Copyright Lawsuit With Japanese Broadcaster |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-12-24 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">The  term '''multilingual titling''' defines, in the field of [[titling]] for the performing arts (musical theatre, drama, audiovisual productions), the chance for the audience to follow more than one linguistic option.

==History==
In the audiovisual field, multilingual titling was made possible by the introduction of [[DVD]] (1996) &lt;ref name="DVD first appearance (1996)"&gt;DVD was first launched on the market by [[Warner Home Video]] both in the USA (1996) and in Europe (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an integrated data-base gives access to several language channels dedicated to titling.&lt;br /&gt;
In the live performing arts, multilingual options (with possibility of individual choice) were introduced in 1998 at [[Santa Fe Opera]] by mean of custom individual displays set mainly on the back of the seats, as in airplanes.&lt;ref name=" set mainly on the back of the seats, as in the airplanes "&gt;This device, lately adopted by other international theatres, has been realized by [[Figaro Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction, at the end of the 1900s, of Web 2.0 and of the new mobile device technologies caused deep changes also in this field. &lt;br /&gt;
In Europe, in 2011, a significant innovation was provided by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] Theatre in Florence, which started the testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices,&lt;ref name="testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices "&gt;OperaVoice devised the software.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be integrated to monolingual [[surtitles]].&lt;br /&gt;
In the same year, another multilingual software for mobile consumer devices was developed, as an alternative to the use of [[subtitles]] in cinemas and, the following year (2012), a new head-mounted display system (multimedia glasses) was introduced, serving the same function.&lt;ref name="starts off a new head mounted display system (multimedia glasses) which serves the same function"&gt;Both products (app and glasses) are by MovieReading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011-2012, the Royal Opera House Muscat carried out the most advanced multilingual custom display system to date, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel.&lt;ref name="multilingual custom display system nowadays, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel"&gt;A [[Radio Marconi]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solutions==
The simultaneous presentation of two languages is quite unusual within the more traditional surtitling system, which is used in most cases with monolingual function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2799">'''Narreme''' is the basic unit of [[narrative structure]]. According to [[Helmut Bonheim]] (2000), the concept of ''narreme'' was developed three decades earlier by [[Eugene Dorfman]] and expanded by [[Henri Wittmann]], The narreme is to [[narratology]] what the [[sememe]] is to [[semantics]], the [[morpheme]] is to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the [[phoneme]] to [[phonology]]. The narreme, however, has yet to be persuasively defined in practice.  In [[Interpretative phenomenological analysis|interpretative]] narratology constrained in a framework of [[Principles and parameters]], narration is the projection of a narreme N&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the abstract head of a narrative macrostructure where N&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; dominates immediately N&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Wittmann 1995).&lt;ref&gt;In this author's views, narremes are the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]]s of narrative [[algorithm]]s, a concept that has found applications in [[game theory]] and [[game semantics]] (Shivel 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games==
NFL-licensed ''NFL Quarterback Challenge'', created by ProAppSports and produced by Adisoft Studios is currently available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] devices. An officially NFL-licensed Quarterback Challenge appeared in 2 other different console video games.  Both video game versions appeared in the same Quarterback Club series of games by [[Acclaim Entertainment]].  The Quarterback Challenge mode appeared in the first and last versions of the game series.  The first was in the original Quarterback Club game released in 1994 on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]].  The second and final appearance of the challenge was in NFL QB Club 2002, published in 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]].  The first version was a sprite-based 2D game, while the later version was fully 3D.  Both of these games and all games in this series were developed by [[Iguana Entertainment]] in Austin, Texas. The 1994 SNES/Genesis version was produced by Russell Byrd.  The 2001 PS2/GameCube version was produced by Charles Normann.

==Discontinued==

'''Opsis''' ({{lang-grc|ὄψις}}) is the Greek word for [[spectacle]] in the [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. Its first use has been traced back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]].'' It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the [[mise en scène]] of a performance or theatrical event.

==Origins==

Opsis comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for "appearance, sight, view."&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%29%2Fyeis&amp;la=greek#lexicon ὄψις] entry in Liddell-Scott disctionary at the Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; The English word [[optic]] is derived from this word.

==Aristotle and the Greeks==

Aristotle's use of the term opsis, as [[Marvin Carlson]] points out, is the "final element of tragedy," but the term "receive[d] no further consideration".&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Carlson, Marvin | title = ''Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present'' | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8014-8154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kennydominican.joyeurs.com/GreekClassics/AristotlePoetics.htm Aristotle - Poetics], Translated by S. H. Butcher, with original Greek text&lt;/ref&gt; but only goes as far as to suggest that "spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet".&lt;ref name="Dukore"&gt;{{cite book | author = DUKORE, Bernard Frank | title = ''Dramatic theory and criticism: Greeks to Grotowski'' | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-0-03-091152-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary theatre theory==
In ''Theories of the Theatre'' by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent "spectacle," but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' Opsis is listed in the "terms" section, and defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
that which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the notions of ''spectacle'' and ''performance''. In Aristotle's ''Poetics, spectacle'' is one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the performance. ''Opsis'' is a spectific feature of the performing arts.&lt;ref name="Pavis"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pavis, Patrice, Christine Shantz, Marvin Carlson | title = ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-8020-8163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J. Michael Walton, in ''The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed'', challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that “the visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.” Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word.

Ronald W. Vince, suggests that while it may &lt;blockquote&gt;
seem logical simply to recognize ''opsis'' as stage spectacle or the ''mise-en-scene'' and so include it — if anywhere — in the vocabulary of performance theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible interpretation which would link ''opsis'' with the art of writing plays as well as with the art of staging them.&lt;ref name="Vince"&gt;{{cite book | author = Vince | title = Opsis as a Term in Dramatic Theory | year = 1990 | journal = Assaph C, no 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Theatre]]''' – is the generic term for the [[performing arts]] and a collaborative form of fine art involving live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event (such as a story) through [[acting]], [[singing]], and/or [[dancing]] before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts.  Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==History of theatre==

[[History of theatre]]

===Western tradition===
Chronological movements of the [[History of theatre#Western tradition|Western tradition]] include:
* [[Theatre of ancient Greece]] – a theatrical [[culture]] that flourished in [[Classical Greece|ancient Greece]] between c. 550 and c. 220 BC.  Tragedy (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.  Western theatre originated in Athens and its drama has had a significant and sustained impact on [[Western culture]] as a whole.
* [[Theatre of ancient Rome]] – diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage.
* [[Medieval theatre]] – theatre of Europe between the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] in approximately the 15th century AD. Medieval theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including [[liturgical drama]], [[mystery plays]], [[morality plays]], [[farce]]s and [[masque]]s.
* [[Commedia dell'arte]] – a form of theatre characterized by [[Mask#Masks in theatre|masked "types"]] which began in Italy in the 16th century, and was responsible for the advent of the actress and [[Improvisational theatre|improvised performances]] based on [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] or [[scenario]]s.
* [[English Renaissance theatre]] – also known as ''early modern English theatre'', refers to the theatre of England, largely based in London, which occurred between the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[closure of the theatres in 1642]]. It includes the [[drama]] of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and many other famous playwrights.
* [[Restoration comedy]] – English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]]. Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness
* [[Restoration spectacular]] – elaborately staged productions beginning the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]].
* [[Neoclassism|Neoclassical theatre]] – theatrical movement that drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]] that was dominant in Europe from the mid-18th to the 19th centuries.
* [[Nineteenth-century theatre]] – wide range of movements in the theatrical [[culture]] of Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the [[Western culture|West]], they include [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]], the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]], the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s plays and operas, [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde's]] drawing-room comedies, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Nineteenth-century theatrical scenery]]
* [[Twentieth-century theatre]] – wide range of movements in the theatrical [[culture]] of the 20th century, including [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]], [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]] and [[Experimental theatre]].
** [[Theatre of the United Kingdom]] –  introduced by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and part of the [[British culture]] since at least 1585.
*** [[West End theatre|West End]] – popular term for mainstream professional theatre staged in the large theatres of [[London]]'s 'Theatreland', the [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;Christopher Innes, 'West End' in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp.1194?1195, {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*** [[Regional theatre in the United States|Regional theatre]] – professional theatre companies outside of New York City that produce their own seasons.
*** [[Summer stock theatre]] – any [[theater (structure)|theatre]] that presents stage productions only in the summer within the United States. Often viewed as a starting point for professional actors, stock casts are typically young, just out of high school or still in college.

===African===
[[History of theatre#African theatre|African Theatre]] includes:
* Ancient Egyptian quasi-theatrical events – earliest recorded quasi-theatrical event dates back to 2000 BCE with the "[[passion plays]]" of [[Ancient Egypt]]. This story of the god [[Osiris]] was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization.
* [[History of theatre#African theatre|Yoruba theatre]] – origins are traced back to the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] of the [[Egungun]] (the "cult of the ancestor").&lt;ref&gt;Adedeji (1969, 60).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[rite|ceremony]] culminates in the essence of the masquerade where it is deemed that ancestors return to the world of the living to visit their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Noret (2008, 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its origin in ritual, Yoruba theatre can be "traced to the 'theatrogenic' nature of a number of the deities in the [[Orisha#Pantheon|Yoruba pantheon]], such as [[Obatala]] the arch divinity, [[Ogoun|Ogun]] the divinity of creativeness and [[Shango|Sango]] the divinity of the storm", whose reverence is imbued "with drama and theatre and the symbolic overall relevance in terms of its relative interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian===
[[History of theatre#Asian theatre|Asian theatre]]
* [[Theatre of India]] – began with [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; and flourished between the 1st and 10th centuries CE, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Temple dance]] – religious performance held in the temples, such as sadir, prescribed by [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] (scriptures that codified temple rituals, etc.). Traces of these ancient temple dances of India are seen in [[Bharatanatyam]] and [[Odissi]].
* [[Theatre of China]] – began as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]] and often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays. Today it is often called '''[[Chinese opera]]''' although this normally refers specifically to the more well-known forms such as [[Beijing Opera]] and [[Cantonese Opera]], there have been many other forms of theatre in China.
* [[History of theatre#Thai theatre|Thai theatre]] – a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic ''[[Ramakien]]'', a version of the Indian ''[[Ramayana]]'', remains popular in Thailand even today.
* [[History of theatre#Khmer and Malay theatre|Khmer and Malay theatre]] – In [[Cambodia]], at the ancient capital [[Angkor Wat]], stories from the Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces.

In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays known as ''akhraja'' were recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565-601).&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Proscenium]] – The proscenium arch was the most common form of theatre building in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The “arch” acts like a picture frame through which the action can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/art/proscenium&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Theatre in the round]] – a [[theatre]] in which the audience surrounds the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/discover-theatres/theatre-faqs/170-what-are-the-types-of-theatre-stages-and-auditoria&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a cold reading involves the entire cast, crew, and designers who are experiencing the script for the first time as an ensemble.

* [[Striking a set]] – the act of taking apart the set, putting away all the props, lights, costumes, etc after the run of a production is over.
* [[Analyzing the text]] – Actors analyze the text (the script) for motivations, clues as to how their character behaves, or what their purpose is. Designers analyze to find out how many set changes are needed, lighting cues, sound cues, costumes needed, props, etc. Costume designers also have to analyze the script like the actors as the text can give clues as to how a character should be clothed.

*[[Run-through]]s – The meaning of this term depends on the director. Generally, is can mean just running through an act with the actors (no technical aspects involved). Sometimes it can involve costume changes as those can become complicated if wig changes are also required. Costume changes can be rehearsed and done in as little as 30 seconds to 2 minutes (if a wig is involved).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

A '''premiere''' or '''première''' is the [[wikt:debut|debut]] (first public presentation) of a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[dance]], or [[musical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=premiere

A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world) and its first presentation in each country. When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by the French dramatist [[Jean Genet]] received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain. 
==History==
Raymond F. Betts attributes the introduction of the film premiere to showman [[Sid Grauman]], who founded [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law... British order | date = 2009-02-20 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt;

Procedurals are often criticized for being [[Wiktionary:formulaic|formulaic]].&lt;ref name="formulaic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="formulaover"&gt;{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5160IN20090207 | title = Networks' new pilots favor formula over experiment | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format.&lt;ref name="duelling"&gt;{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/duelling-sleuths/2006/08/08/1154802894078.html | title = Duelling sleuths | date = 2006-08-10 | work = [[The Age]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomystery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Carter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html?_r=1 | title = No Mystery: Ratings Heat Up for ‘NCIS’ | date = 2008-11-16 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a [[story arc]]).&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jason Hughes | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/23/what-if-house-stopped-being-a-procedural/ | title = What if House stopped being a procedural? | date = 2009-09-23 | work = [[TVSquad]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular variant is the [[police procedural]].

An '''entertainment promoter''' works in entertainment industries, including music and sports, as an individual or organization in the business of [[Promotion (marketing)|marketing and promoting]] live, or [[pay-per-view]] and similar, events, such as [[concert]]s/[[gig (musical performance)|gigs]], [[sports]] events, [[festival]]s, [[rave]]s, and [[nightclub]] performances.

== Description ==

=== Business model ===
Promoters are typically engaged as [[independent contractor]]s or representative companies by entertainment venues, earning a pre-arranged fee, or a share of revenues (colloquially known as a "cut" and "share of the house"), or both. A share of revenues is often a simple percentage of admission fees (called "the door") and/or food and drink sales, with many variations possible, such as minimums or maximums, allowances for various expenses, or limitations (such as only alcohol sales after midnight). Other promoters operate independently, renting venues for a fixed fee, or under a [[revenue sharing]] arrangement with the venue holder, thus keeping larger profits from successful events. One common arrangement for small venues is for the promoter to earn all of the admissions fees, while the venue retains all food and drink revenue.

Some venues have exclusive arrangements with a single promotion company, others work with multiple promoters on a rotating schedule (one night per week, for example), or on an event-by-event basis. Promoters often work together — either as equal partners, or as [[subcontractor]]s to each other's events. Several promoters may work together for a special event, such as a large [[New Year's Eve]] party in a hotel ballroom. They may also engage [[freelance]] hosts for their social influence; these amateur promoters market the events to their circle of friends and/or [[social media]] followers, in exchange for special treatment and/or free admission to the event and at times, and may form or be included in [[street team]]s that promote events at other live venues.

Minimally, an event promoter manages [[publicity]] and [[advertising]]. Depending on the arrangement, they may also handle [[security]], [[Ticket (admission)|ticket sales]], event admission (door policies), decorations, and booking of other entertainers. Many promoters are [[DJ]]s or [[musician]]s themselves, and may perform at their own events. Some bloggers and individuals with a large following on social media may consider themselves as promoters and charge fees promotional service via their social media platform(s), or through their efforts. 

Many musicians and artists act as de facto promoters for their own concerts, either directly or through their manager or [[Talent agent|booking company]]. Historically, promotion has been a [[cottage industry]], with companies operated by one or several well-connected charismatic individuals, often working part-time.  However, with the rise of corporate ownership of live entertainment assets, several large companies have emerged in the field.

=== Contracts and disputes ===
There are often disputes over money in the promotions industry because it is largely cash business with a history of corruption and uneven [[recordkeeping]].  In addition there are many [[accounting]] complexities to manage, particularly for large events: revenue, expenses, and  oversight of [[parking]], [[Cloakroom|coat checks]], [[Concession (contract)|concession]] vendor sales (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[compact disc|CDs]] and [[t-shirt]]s), [[box office]] so-called "[[convenience fee]]s", [[in kind]] trades, promotional give-away items used to lure guests (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;free drinks), costs for [[insurance]], [[janitor|cleaning]] staff, and so on. One area of frequent contention are [[quid pro quo]] [[cross-promotion]]s, where the promoter or some other party connected with the venue will obtain a favor (for example, a price discount) in exchange for giving a future favor to the vendor. If the existence of the scheme, or the relationship between the parties, is undisclosed this may become a form of [[bribery]].  Another opportunity for misunderstanding are the various "lists" of guests who will be admitted for free or with VIP treatment, and the "door policy" used by bouncers to decide who will be admitted and at what price. To deal with these complexities event contracts can become quite long and detailed.  Whether written or not, these arrangements tend to favor the party with the greater sophistication or the more control over the production of the event. Even the most detailed, professionally written and negotiated contracts can become the subject of lawsuits over interpretation.

Because nightclubs are often associated with drug and alcohol consumption, rowdiness, and other late-night behavior, promoters may become entangled in various criminal disputes as well.

=== Methods ===
Promoters bring crowds through a variety of methods.  The most direct are [[guerrilla marketing]] techniques such as plastering [[posters]] on outdoor walls, [[flyposting]], and distributing [[handbills]] on windows of cars parked in entertainment districts. Promoters also keep mailing lists, usually [[email list]]s, of their preferred guests and their wider list of potential customers. Recently, many promoters have taken advantage of online technology such as [[online social network]]s and event listing sites to handle publicity, invitations, mailing lists, and so on. Clubs and promoters are among leaders in [[SMS]] text message advertising to their own lists as well as sponsored snippets on third-party lists for daily content to subscribers. Many fans promote events,products through their Facebook/Twitter/Myspace on their own free will.

Promoters often build a [[brand]] out of their own personalities and the parties they host, marketing the events under a consistent name, style, type of program, and social experience that downplays the branding of the venue or artist.  They may develop a loyal clientele that will follow them from one location to another.

=== Image promotion and VIP hosting ===

In cosmopolitan cities with large affluent populations, there are upscale venues that employ the services of a special kind of promoter called an image promoter.  The role of the image promoter is to bring celebrities or fashion models to high end venues and host them at a VIP table.  In order to entice models and celebrities to come to the venue, the image promoter is provided with a VIP table and complementary alcohol.  High end venues use the presence of models and celebrities to market their venue to an affluent clientele which may often only obtain admittance to the venue through agreeing to spend a certain amount of money on alcohol at the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130082532/http://www.nycnightadventures.com/20/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42148">'''[[Public]]''' '''[[rhetoric]]''' refers to discourse both within a group of people and between groups, often centering on the process by which [[individual]] or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of [[tourism]] to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.

== Public rhetoric participants ==
A '''public''', not to be confused with ''the'' public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. [[Michael Warner]] describes a public as “being self-organized, …a relationship among strangers …[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.”&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|56}} Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public “entails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Imagining the public sphere|last = Asen|first = Robert|date = 2002|journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 35|issue = 4|page = |pages = 345–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|346}} To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.

=== Counterpublics ===
Within the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. “Counterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,” writes Asen''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|358}} Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within a gay or queer counterpublic, for example, no one is in the closet: the presumptive heterosexuality that constitutes the closet for individuals in ordinary speech is suspended. But this circulatory space, freed from heteronormative speech protocols, is itself marked by that very suspension: speech that addresses any participant as queer will circulate up to a point, at which it is certain to meet intense resistance. It might therefore circulate in special, protected venues, in limited publications. The individual struggle with stigma is transposed, as it were, to the conflict between modes of publicness. The expansive nature of public address will seek to keep moving that frontier for a queer public, to seek more and more places to circulate where people will recognize themselves in its address; but no one is likely to be unaware of the risk and conflict involved.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Asen furthers, “Individuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}} Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}}

=== Subaltern and bourgeois groups ===
Amid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] publics, respectively. For example, in their article “Graffiti Hurts in the United States,” Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects “actually work to carry out a ‘normative’ prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, ‘A legal mural might have some effect in making . . . people’s culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else’s’ terms.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Publics and the City|last = Iveson|first = Kurt|publisher = Blackwell|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Graffiti hurts and the eradication of alternative landscape expression|last = Moreau|first = Terri|date = 2011|journal = Geographical Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00075.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Alderman|first2 = Derek H.|issue = 1|volume = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|109}}  Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a [[gay]] counterpublic produce “clones” representing “well-built,” effeminate, white males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Keith Haring and Queer Xerography|last = Herring|first = Scott|date = 2007|journal = Public Culture|doi = 10.1215/08992363-2006-03|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 329–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|333}} While [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|whiteness]] is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized.

A bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of “private individuals…[that] do not ‘rule’.... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article|last = Habermas|first = Jürgen|date = 1974|journal = New German Critique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–55|editor-last = Lennox|editor-first = Sarah|editor2-last = Lennox|editor2-first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51}} The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.

=== Strangers ===
'''Strangers''' are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|57}}

=== Orientation ===
Public rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, “describ[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|10–11}} As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public.

How one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of “changing the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity…”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The experience of place: A new way of looking at and dealing with our radically changing cities and countryside|last = Hiss|first = Tony|publisher = Random House, Inc|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}} The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for “park experience”, in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42–44}} Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.

== Rhetoric for public use ==
According to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, “rhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[service-learning|service learning]] and [[civic engagement]] increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric’s reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians—filled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric’s reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.

=== Rhetoric in praxis as social action ===
Because rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article “The Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change” that “one way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.

=== Reciprocity from practicing rhetoric in public spaces ===
In an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to “empower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"/&gt; In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a [[kairos|kairotic moment]] in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, “[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.”&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public’s general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's [[ethos]] in the eyes of the general public.

=== Reforming the public’s view of rhetoric ===
While the general populace currently views “doing rhetoric” as “menacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric’s reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard’s article, “The Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,” she discusses how [[Epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of “[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize . . . [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality . . . ”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheard continues to explain that “epideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience’s perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.

== Spaces ==
Spaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.

=== Places vs. Spaces ===
To understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between “space” and “place.” In his book [[The Practice of Everyday Life]], [[Michel de Certeau]], defines places as an “instantaneous configuration of positions.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"&gt;Certeau 1988, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places.

Certeau claims that places are different from spaces because places are “ultimately reducible to being there” while spaces are specified “by the actions of historical subjects.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them.&lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.

=== Utopias and heterotopias ===
[[Michel Foucault]] built on Certeau’s definition of space in his essay, “Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,” pointing out that spaces were defined by “a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"&gt;Foucault 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias.

==== Utopias ====
According to Foucault, [[utopias]] are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt; Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places.

==== Heterotopias ====
[[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopias]] are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as “effectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt;  These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically.

==== Middle spaces ====
Middle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about “the ‘codes’ to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.

== Tourism as public rhetoric ==

In discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities’ relationships to each other.

=== Identity politics ===

Scholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. [[Jürgen Habermas]], for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual’s sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: “With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of ‘refeudalization’ of the public sphere.”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas’ concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.

=== Toxic tourism ===

Whereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of identity is exemplified by the work of [[Phaedra Pezzullo]]. In ''Toxic Tourism'', Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism’s ability to engage all of the body’s senses “may help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric’s concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings.

Researchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes “that the ‘toxic baggage’ the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of ‘polluted’ and ‘polluting’ Others.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public’s normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to “look back” at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of becoming the Object of the Other’s gaze raises the possibility that the tourist’s perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.

=== Tourism and publics ===

Taken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: “Speaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. . . . Such is the image of totalitarianism.”&lt;ref&gt;Warner 2002, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics.

Key to Warner and other scholars’ understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to “the pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us . . . [, but include]  people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"&gt;Warner 2002, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner goes on to state that, “a public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"/&gt; Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.

==Birthplaces of public rhetoric: The street &amp; the riot==
In its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work [http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/files/2914/0533/6073/Habermas_1974.pdf “The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article”] Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: “Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy…”.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public’s demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by “competitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.”&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest—which Habermas refers to as “the street”—often affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue.

The riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of “the ways in which words fail us… all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement “in their own backyards,” and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.

== Digital public ==
A digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a [[social network]], or a group of people related to each other in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Lange 2008, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled “epistemopolis.”&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"&gt;Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"/&gt; These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn’t necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it  provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public.

A digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in [[analog signal|analog device]] spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Poster 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Silver 2005, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider [[Wikipedia]]: “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.” This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=dh;c=dh;idno=13030181.0001.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;xc=1;g=dculture|Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice]. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and [[Digital rhetoric#Circulation|circulate]] his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.

=== Public Rhetoric in the Digital Realm ===
The digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, [[autonomy]], and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an [[digital rhetoric#Avatars|avatar]], while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, “technology has fused with human consciousness itself,”&lt;ref&gt;Ong 1980, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a collective, shared, public memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital [[social activism]] (also referred to as [[internet activism]] or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey &amp; Ayers 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action.

[[Digital rhetoric]] is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses [[Digital rhetoric#Canons|the rhetorical canons]] in their composition.

== The photographic image as an icon ==
Photographic images can function in public rhetoric as [[Cultural icon|icons]] of U.S. public culture. According to [[Robert Hariman]] and [[John Lucaites|John Louis Lucaites]] in ''No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy'', iconic images “work in several registers of ritual and response.”&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.

=== What makes an icon an icon? ===
While multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons’ functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows:

# is easily recognized by many people of varied backgrounds;
# is an object of veneration and other complex emotional responses;
# is reproduced widely and placed prominently in both public and private settings;
# is used to orient the individual [viewer] within a context of collective identity, obligation, and power;
# represents large swaths of historical experience and acquires its own history of appropriation and commentary;
# stands above the welter of news, debates, decisions, and investigations; and/or
# bears witness to something that exceeds words.&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"/&gt;
If a photographic image holds one or more of the above-mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.

=== Functions of photographic icons in  public life ===
As a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, “each image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; An iconic image [[semiotically]] promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: “reproducing [[ideology]], communicating social knowledge, shaping collective [[Memoria|memory]], modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman and Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproducing ideology ====
Iconic images have the capability of representing [[ideology]], which Hariman and Lucaites define as “a set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology.

==== Communicating social knowledge ====
Because icons are distinctively public visual images, they “recast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance.

==== Shaping collective memory ====
Photographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, “the more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations’ understanding of public life”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in the specific time period.

==== Modeling citizenship ====
Members of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially “display the public to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Providing figural resources for communicative action ====
Since society can be considered “abstract” in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a “good citizen.” Hariman and Lucaites explain that “an iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.

{{Performing arts}}
'''Puppetry''' is a form of [[theatre]] or performance that involves the manipulation of [[puppet]]s – [[inanimate]] objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a [[puppeteer]]. Such a performance is also known as a {{nowrap|'''puppet play'''}}. The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in [[storytelling]].

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are [[finger puppet]]s, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and [[sock puppet]]s, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth". A [[hand puppet]] is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around ([[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. [[Marionette]]s are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as [[sacred]] objects in [[rituals]], as symbolic [[Effigy|effigies]] in celebrations such as [[carnival]]s, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in [[transformative arts]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History'', John Bell, Detroit Institute of Art, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dugan, E.A., ''Emotions in Motion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There is evidence that they were used in [[Egypt]] as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and [[ivory]] have also been found in Egyptian tombs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Hieroglyphs]] also describe "walking statues" being used in ancient [[Egypt]]ian religious dramas.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry was practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, David, ''Puppetry'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and [[masks]]) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and [[mask|masked performance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Asia ===

====East, Southeast and South Asia====
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese "commander-in-chief" marionette character]]
There is slight evidence for puppetry in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14/&gt; The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Tamil literature]] from the [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam Era]], and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including [[edicts of Ashoka|Ashokan edicts]], describe puppets.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14-15&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Works like the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and the ''[[Kamasutra]]'' elaborate on puppetry in some detail.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-15-16&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese ''[[Wayang]]'' theater was influenced by [[India]]n traditions.&lt;ref name=Bell-puppet-46&gt;Bell, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in [[Sanskrit]] plays was known as "Sutradhara",  "the holder of strings".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; ''Wayang'' is a strong tradition of puppetry native of [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]] &amp; [[Bali]]. In [[Java]], [[Wayang Kulit Indonesia|wayang kulit]], an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is [[Wayang golek]].

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in "pi-yung xi", the "theatre of the lantern shadows", or, as it is more commonly known today, [[Shadow theatre|Chinese shadow theatre]]. By the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In [[Taiwan]], [[budaixi]] puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, [[somersault]]s in the air.

[[Japan]] has many forms of puppetry, including the [[bunraku]]. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.

[[Image:Rajasthani-puppeteer.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer from [[Rajasthan]] (India)]]
In [[Korea]], the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King.&lt;ref name="sangsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/768|author=Sang-su, Choe|title=A Study of the Korean Puppet Play|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean, the word for puppet is "Kkoktugakshi".&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt; "Gagsi" means a "bride" or a "young woman", which was the most common form the dolls took. A [[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkoktugakshi puppet play]] has eight scenes.&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt;

[[Thailand]] has [[Hun Krabok]], a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.

[[Vietnam]] developed the art form of [[water puppetry]], that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.

====India====
{{Main|Puppetry in India}}
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' there are references to puppets. The [[Rajasthani Puppet]] from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, [[Ramdas Padhye]], subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.php|title=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT)|website=ccrtindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;String puppets
[[File:Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha) at Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune.JPG|thumb|Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha)]]
India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed.  The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

;Shadow puppets
[[File:Tholpava koothu shadow puppet back stage (1).jpg|thumb|Tholpavakoothu (Kerala)]]
India has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. [[Tholpavakoothu]] (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of [[shadow puppetry]] that is unique to [[Kerala]], [[India]].  The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.

;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. 
;Glove puppets
Glove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the ''dholak''with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.

====Afghanistan====
[[Afghanistan]] has produced a form of puppetry known as [[buz-baz]].  During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a [[markhor]] while playing a [[dambura]].

===West Asia===
[[Image:Karagoez davulcu.jpg|110px|thumb|right|Karagoz, Turkish shadow puppetry]]
Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. [[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in [[Istanbul]] where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Mutlu, Hayali Mustafa, ''Tradition Folk The Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'', a [[metaphor]] translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadow of fancy", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, "the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also..."special effects" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Feeney, John, ''Saudi Aramco World'' (article), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular .&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Willem, ''The History of Theater in Iran'', {{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khane''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets.&lt;ref&gt;Mehr News Agency, [http://www.mehrnews.com www.mehrnews.com], 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran Daily'' [http://www.iran-daily.com www.iran-daily.com], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th/4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from [[ancient Greece]], historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, John, ''Practical Puppetry'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;

In ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]] clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alcamo-Pupi-bjs2007-01.jpg|Sicilian Puppet Theatre|thumb|right]]

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance
Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]] refer to them.&lt;ref name="Binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church used marionettes to perform [[morality plays]].&lt;ref name="Binyon"/&gt; It is believed that the word '''[[marionette]]''' originates from the little figures of the [[Virgin Mary]], hence the word "marionette" or "Mary doll.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Mabel &amp; Les, ''Marionettes: A Hobby for Everyone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more [[ribald]] and [[slapstick]]. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called [[Commedia dell'arte]]. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Suib, Leonard Broadman, Muriel, ''Marionettes Onstage!'', p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called "[[Opera dei pupi]]", or "Opera of the puppets". The "Opera dei pupi" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the [[troubadour|Provençal troubadour tradition]], in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] circles, as a celebration of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Signorelli, Collezione Maria,  [http://www.collezionemariasignorelli.it/inglese_01_inizio.htm www.collezionemariasignorelli.it].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the marionettes of [[Pietro Radillo]] became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====France====
[[Guignol]] is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". [[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Guignol de Lyon]]

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====
[[File:Burattini ca 1770.jpg|British Puppet theatre (Punch and Judy style), c. 1770|thumb|right]]
The traditional British ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The character of "Punch" derives from the character [[Pulcinella]], which was Anglicized to ''Punchinello''. He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]], figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally "Joan", but later became "Judy". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar ''Punch and Judy'' puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable [[:wikt:booth|booth]]. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. One of Shaw's last plays, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

From 1957-1969, [[Gerry Anderson]] produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with [[Roberta Leigh]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ending with ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Many of these series (the most famous of which was ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'') employed a technique called [[Supermarionation]], which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with ''[[Terrahawks]]'' and the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot]] ''[[Space Precinct#Pilot|Space Police]]'' in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the [[Little Angel Theatre]] in [[Islington]], London, [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] in London, [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]], the [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]], [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, [[Biggar, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. [[Don Austen]], a British puppeteer, worked with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and [[Green Ginger]], which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political [[satire]] in the British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including ''[[War Horse (play)|Warhorse]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]] and ''[[Madama Butterfly|Madam Butterfly]]'' at the [[English National Opera]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is ''Jan Klaassen'' (and Judy is ''Katrijn''); in Denmark ''Mester Jackel''; in Russia ''Petrushka''; and in Romania ''Vasilache''. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mullholland, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called [[Kasperle]] of Kaspar while Judy is called [[Grete]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, [[Count Franz Pocci]] founded the [[Münchner Marionettentheater|Munich Marionette Theatre]]. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. [[Albrecht Roser]] has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in [[Stuttgart]]. His characters ''Clown Gustaf'' and ''Grandmother'' are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppets'' by David Currell, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grandmother'', while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In [[Lindau]], [[Lindauer Marionettenoper|the Lindau Marionette Opera]] was founded in 2000 by [[Bernard Leismueller]] and [[Ralf Hechelmann]]. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

In Augsburg, the historic [[Augsburger Puppenkiste|Augsburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1943 by [[Walter Oehmichen]]. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, [[Klaus Marschall]] and [[Juergen Marschall]].

Much earlier in nearby [[Salzburg]], Austria, the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]] and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of [[Gretl Aicher]]. It performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

====Czech Republic====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in [[Prague]], and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="dubska"&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, Jan Novak, Nina Malikova and Marie Zdenkova, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer,&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt;

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, [[Josef Skupa]] created his most famous puppet characters: comical father [[Spejbl]] and his rascal son [[Hurvínek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. An important puppet organisation is the [[National Marionette Theatre]] in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky ("Cakes and Puppets"), founded by [[Marek Bečka]].&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Jiří Trnka]] was an acknowledged leader in this area.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Puppets in Prague, www.puppetsinprague.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]], but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The [[Teotihuacan]] culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also used ceremonial puppets.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied [[Hernando Cortez]] on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals,  working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the [[United States]]. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with [[Howdy Doody]] of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. [[Bil Baird]] worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, [[Cora Eisenberg]] had their own marionette theatre in New York. [[Ventriloquist]], [[Edgar Bergen]] also made a major contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Funni, Arthur, ''The Radio Years of Bergen and McCarthy'' (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Peter Schumann's [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, [[Jim Henson]] was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. Initially, through the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and later in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. [[Wayland Flowers]] also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, [[Madame]].

[[Sid and Marty Krofft]] are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely [[HR Puffinstuff]] and [[Lidsville]]

Puppets also have been used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, notably with the character of [[Yoda]]. His voice and manipulation was provided by [[Frank Oz]].

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, [[Peter Scriven]] founded the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]] and had beautiful marionette productions such as [[The Tintookies]], [[Little Fella Bindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=163386&amp;search=sad&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s= 98/25/2 Marionette puppet, 'Tintookies Little Fella Bindi', Aboriginal figure, papier mache / wood / cotton / felt / feathers / metal, designed by Colin Garland for the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1958-1977 - Powerhouse Museum Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Explorers]] and [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by [[Barbara Turnbull]] and her husband [[Bill Turnbull (puppeteer)]] toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the [[Queensland Arts Council]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]], [[Brisbane]]. [[David Poulton]] toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'Stutter leads to lifetime with puppets', Sunshine Coast Daily, 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hamilton (puppeteer)|David Hamilton]], one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster [[Jamie Dunn]] was famous for his Muppet-style character, [[Agro (puppet)]] who featured on several [[Seven Network]] television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the [[United States]] by puppeteers from the [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson Company]], [[Brett Hansen]] and his [[Brisbane]] based [[Larrikin Puppets]] company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. [[Cabaret Puppet Theatre]], based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cabaret Puppet Theatre www.cabaretpuppettheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne [[Handspan Theatre]] 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

[[File:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|[[Snuff Puppets]] Skullies from Scarey|thumb|right]]
A post-graduate course existed at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer [[Norman Hetherington]] was famous for his marionette, [[Mr. Squiggle]] who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from "squiggles" sent in by children from around the country. [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of [[UNIMA Australia]], former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

[[Rod Hull]] also made a contribution with his puppet [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. [[Snuff Puppets]] is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in [[Melbourne]], their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

==Contemporary era==

From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the "lack of self-consciousness" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History''/John Bell/Chapter 6/Detroit Institute of Art/2000 {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets.png|thumb|Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets]]

[[Sergei Obraztsov]] explored the concept of ''kukolnost'' ('puppetness'), despite [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence on realism.
Other pioneers, including [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Erwin Piscator]] were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. [[Maeterlinck]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as [[Picasso]], [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] began to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Craig's concept of the "übermarionette"&amp;mdash;in which the director treats the actors like objects&amp;mdash;has been highly influential on contemporary "object theatre" and "[[physical theatre]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Tadeusz Kantor]] frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms "putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as [[Tony Sarg]], Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, [[Bil Baird]], Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, [[Peter Schumann]], [[Dattatreya Aralikatte]], [[Jim Henson]], [[Dadi Pudumjee]], and [[Julie Taymor]] have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], Bob Frith of [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and Sandy Speiler of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Theatre, from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook''/James Roose-Evans, 1970 Studio Vista {{ISBN|0-415-00963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jim Henson Foundation]], founded by puppeteer and [[Muppet]] creator [[Jim Henson]], is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Henson Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hensonfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in [[Boise, Idaho]] continue the [[avant garde]] [[satire|satirical]] tradition for [[millennial]]s.&lt;ref name="Early 21st-century puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/horrific-puppet-affair-finds-humor-in-the-space-between-halloween-and-christmas/Content?oid=8219881 |title=Horrific Puppet Affair Finds Humor in the Space Between Halloween and Christmas  |last=Berry |first=Harrison |date=2017-12-12 |website=Boise Weekly |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennial Avant Garde Puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseartsandhistory.org/blog/2017/12/20/creators-makers-and-doers-homegrown-theatre/ |title=Puppetry, Pantomime, &amp; Projections: HomeGrown Theatre's Shortcut to Spectacle |last=Burton |first=Brooke |date=2017-12-20 |website=Boise City Department of Arts &amp; History |access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">A '''script coordinator''' is a role in the production of a [[film]] or [[television program|television series]]. The script coordinator is responsible for producing each [[draft document|draft]] of the [[screenplay|script]] and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.

On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and [[Film_production#Production|production]] departments. The writers deliver the first [[draft document|draft]] of a [[screenplay|script]] to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the [[screenplay|script]] for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-script-coordinator-do.htm wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script coordinator must check the [[draft document|draft]] for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the [[draft document|draft]]. Once a [[screenplay|script]] has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the [[screenplay|script]]. The process of how widely each [[draft document|draft]] is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com/2012/07/5-questions-with-writers-assistant-and.html aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the [[screenplay|script]] and again check the [[screenplay|script]] for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a [[Bible (writing)|show bible]] that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. 

A script coordinator is a distinct role from [[script supervisor]]. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the [[screenplay|script]] for editing purposes rather than [[pre-production]] coordination of the [[screenplay|script]] to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time [[screenwriter]] is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

A '''secret history''' (or '''shadow history''') is a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] interpretation of either fictional or real [[history]] which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. "Secret history" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.

==Secret histories of the real world==
{{main article|Historical revisionism}}
Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]": one such example is ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. Secret histories can range from standard [[historical revisionism]] with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negative historical revisionism]] wherein facts are deliberately omitted, [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] or distorted.

The quintessential example secret history is the ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Anecdota]]'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (known for centuries as the ''Secret History''). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the [[Vatican Library]] and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ("the unpublished composition"). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html The Secret History], English translation (Dewing, 1935) at [[LacusCurtius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional secret histories==
Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] universe to preserve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the present by reconciling [[paranormal]], [[anachronistic]], or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' cast the devastating [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] during the 1990s, and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] were all part of one wider conflict.

===Secret history thrillers===
A certain type of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando ''nearly'' carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not [[alternate history]] but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.

Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:

* ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' by [[Ken Follett]]: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling [[D-Day]];
* ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing [[Charles De Gaulle]], president of France, in 1963.

These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.

Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with [[World War II]] backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:
* ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'': a German spy in [[Cairo]] nearly succeeds in letting [[Erwin Rommel]] win at [[El Alamein]].
* ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'': a [[Russian anarchist]] in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the [[First World War]].

Works of other writers fitting within this type include:
* ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages.
* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' by [[Jack Higgins]]: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] out of wartime England.
* ''[[The Romanov Succession]]'' by [[Brian Garfield]]: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, [[Russia]]n exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and restore the monarchy.
* ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]]: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into not running for a third term.
* ''[[The Ninth Man]]'' by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt.
* ''[[Stalag Texas]]'', also by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].
* ''An Exchange of Eagles'' by [[Owen Sela]]: In 1940, senior officers of the German [[Abwehr]] and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army) |American Military Intelligence]] make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] with the assumption that they would be replaced by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating.
* In the 2006 [[historical detective]] novel, ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' by [[Jason Goodwin]], a power-mad [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan [[Mehmet II]] and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of [[Ataturk]].
* In the thriller ''[[The Redbreast]]'' by [[Jo Nesbø]], a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince.

Different types of secret history thriller include:

* ''[[The Leader and the Damned]]'' by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]]: [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a [[Look-alike|double]]. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of [[Martin Bormann]] in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. 
* ''[[XPD]]'' by [[Len Deighton]]: [[Winston Churchill]] was far more of an [[appeaser]] than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle.
* The mystery series by [[Elliott Roosevelt]] in which his mother, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], is the detective – placing murder mysteries in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, ''[[Murder at the Chateau]]'', Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high-level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941.
* ''[[The Berkut]]'' by Joseph Heywood. [[Adolf Hitler]] did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with [[Eva Braun]]. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the [[Kremlin]] basement until the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, when he was secretly executed.
* Many of the "Blackford Oakes" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in ''[[Who's on First (novel)|Who's on First]]'', Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching [[Sputnik]] ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in ''[[Marco Polo, if You Can]]'', Oakes is the real-life [[U2]] pilot [[Gary Powers]], and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the [[U2 incident]] was actually planned from the start, [[Gary Powers]] was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never happened).
* The plot of [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is based on the assumption that on the eve of [[World War I]] in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], with the cooperation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] – to sell [[Canada]] to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records – to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing).
* An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the [[BBC]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Imperial Moon]]'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his companions [[Vislor Turlough]] and [[Kamelion]] learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.
* Another example of a science-fiction secret history is ''[[The Proteus Operation]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of [[World War II]]: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] and provided invaluable  information about how the Germans won in their history – which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to  Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as [[Harry Hopkins]], and to a few scientists such as [[Einstein]]. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy – and strictly kept it until their deaths – and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told.
* [[James A. Hetley]]'s [[Contemporary Fantasy]] books ''Dragon's Eye'' and ''Dragon's Teeth'' are based on the assumption that in the Fourteenth Century several boatloads of rebellious [[Welsh people|Welsh]], opposing the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages| English conquest of their homeland]], secretly crossed the Atlantic and established themselves at what would become the State of [[Maine]]. Being not very numerous and not the harbingers of further immigrants, they were able to reach a reasonable accommodation with the matrilineal leadership of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. Centuries later they blended with later European immigrants, stating truthfully that their name was Morgan and that they were of Welsh origin, while being vague on when they had come to America. In the 17th and 18th Century they were involved in piracy, later shifted to other lucrative (and highly illegal) activities. By the present time, the Welsh Morgans along with the Native American Haskells are still the two leading families of Stonefort, Maine. In their well-guarded home are preserved various artifacts of their ancestors, and manuscripts in Medieval Latin and Welsh  - which historians would have loved to see, but the Morgans prefer not to share them with outsiders.

===Fictional "secret" versions of historical events===
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' last major work, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'' asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. 
* Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] by the junior officer [[John Felton (assassin)#In fiction| John Felton]]. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French [[Cardinal Richelieu]], while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. 
* [[Elizabeth Bear]]'s "Promethean Age" series constitutes a massive secret history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monette|first=Sarah|title=An Interview with Elizabeth Bear, conducted by Sarah Monette|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=fGCbg3M4XX5PLux3JCZiJA&amp;pq=elizabeth%20bear%27s%20%22promethean%20age%22%20%22secret%20history%22%20review&amp;cp=51&amp;gs_id=iw&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=22adff2dc2288598&amp;biw=840&amp;bih=359&amp;bs=1|publisher=Subterranean Press|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Elizabethan]] England, with considerable [[fantasy]] elements. Among other things the series asserts that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] was a secret illegitimate son of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]; that Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]] were dedicated to Marlowe; that [[Edmund Spencer]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch [[Morgan le Fay]]; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* The [[The Black Adder|first series]] of ''[[Blackadder]]'', in which [[Henry VII of England]] comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of "Richard IV" from the history books.  Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.
*The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" organization that originated with the [[Knights Templar]]. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret "First Civilization", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.
* The background of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series of [[contemporary fantasy]] detective thrillers includes the assertion that [[Isaac Newton]], in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who codified the basic principles of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis'' ([[Latin]] for "Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the [[Bodleian Library]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, [[World War II]] had also been fought by magical means, with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany – where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash [[vampire]]s and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of [[Caroline of Ansbach]]; during the [[War of 1812]] British wizards trained [[Tecumseh]]'s [[medicine men]] in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; [[Maynard Keynes]], though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the [[Iraq War]] suffered a major fiasco at [[Falluja]] which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.  
* [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' suggests that Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], who died while on the [[Second Crusade]], had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.
* Gore Vidal's novel "Creation", purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entagling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persian counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted.  Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly greatly influenced India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also the character of Buddhism, a major world religion.

* The books of [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]] often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, ''The Jefferson Key'', part of Berry's [[Cotton Malone]] series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President ([[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881,[[William McKinley]] in 1901 and [[John Kennedy]] in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret "Commonwealth" of pirates (or "privateers"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] during WWI and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth "a perpetual authorization" to act as [[privateer]]s. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], secret survivals of the [[Knights Templar]] and the fate of the books of the [[Alexandrine Library]].

==Secret histories of fictional worlds==
"[[Retcon]]", alteration of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] breach might be "revealed" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running [[superhero]] comic books.

===Examples===
* When [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote ''[[The Final Problem]]'' he fully intended to kill off [[Sherlock Holmes]] and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody – including even his close friend Dr. Watson – believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place : the "death" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' also alludes to hidden ''fictional'' history, establishing that during the events of the serial ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', the [[First Doctor]] had in his possession a super-weapon, the [[Hand of Omega]] stolen from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s. The story also implies that he knew of the [[Daleks]] before he "first" met them.
* [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' made years of "established" events and characters from the [[DC Universe]] (for example the existence of [[Krypto]]) "un-happen". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it "secret".
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family|Wold Newton]] universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways.
* [[Warren Ellis]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes.
* [[Philip José Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'' reinterprets [[Jules Verne]]'s famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf.
* Many of the novels by American [[Tim Powers]] are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' had a different interpretation of pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the [[Fountain of Youth]], Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as "Edmund Morcilla" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel ''[[Declare]]'' presents a secret history of the Cold War, with America and the U.K. jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces.

==Time travel secret histories==

The plots of some [[Time travel]] books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.

For example, [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "Brave to be a King" asserts that King [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is "cancelled out" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, "The Sorrow of Odin the Goth", asserts that also the Nordic god [[Odin]]/[[Wodan]] was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient [[Goths]] and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. 

[[Paul Levinson]]'s "[[The Plot to Save Socrates]]" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher [[Socrates]] did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general [[Alcibiades]] had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician [[Hypatia]] of [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher [[William Henry Appleton]] had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited [[Classical Greece]] and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.

According to [[David Drake]]'s novel "[[Birds of Prey (Drake novel)|Birds of Prey]]", the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Third Century Crisis]] was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named [[Diocletian]], realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Bĺake's Progress'' assumes that the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife [[Catherine Blake| Kate]] were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various [[alternate timeline]]s, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of [[John Milton]], the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. [[William Blake's mythology]] is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom  Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character [[Urizen]] was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27452">'''Stage combat''' or '''fight choreography''' is a specialised technique in [[theatre]] designed to create the [[illusion]] of physical [[combat]] without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live [[stage plays]] as well as [[operatic]] and [[ballet]] productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the [[choreography]] of [[film]]ed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of [[stunts]] and is a common field of study for [[actor]]s. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in [[dance]] or [[martial art]]s training.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with [[Aristotle]] quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chpt. 6, Sect. II. Line 16-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or indeed it may be traced to the [[origins of the human species]] and [[primate]] [[display behaviour]]. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in [[warrior|warrior societies]], and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into [[war dance]]s. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where [[Herodotus]] in his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histories|last=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Book II|location=|pages=Line 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.

===Post-classical history===
Fights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman [[gladiator]]s, and any public [[duel]], such as the [[judicial duel]] of the [[European Middle Ages]]. The [[medieval tournament]] and [[jousting|joust]] are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] developed into a [[sport]] with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary [[Formula One]] races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with [[fencing schools]]. Some German [[fechtbuch]] ("combat manuals", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such ''Klopffechten'' ("knockabout fighting"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (''fechten zu schimpf'', 'rant fighting') and real combat (''fechten zu ernst'', 'earnest fighting').

The history of European theatrical combat has its roots in [[medieval theatre]], and becomes tangible in [[Elizabethan drama]]. [[Richard Tarlton|Richard Tarleton]], who was a member of both William [[Shakespeare]]'s acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stage Fights|last=Gordon|first=Gilbert|publisher=Theatre Art Books|year=1973|isbn=0-87830-131-3|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern History===
During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese ''[[Kabuki]]'' theater (as ''tachimawari'' "fighting scenes"), Chinese [[Beijing Opera]] and Indian theater.

[[fencing (sport)|Fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]] and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Tony.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats", identified by names such as the "Round Eights" and the "Glasgow Tens".

[[Cinematic fencing]] has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was [[Paddy Crean]] who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in [[Errol Flynn filmography|Errol Flynn movies]], among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mayafair|title=The Fight Master: A Documentary about Paddy Crean|date=2008-03-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mW6P8bZADk&amp;t=330s|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. H. Barry]] and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/a-e/b.h.-barry|title=http://www.primarystagesoffcenter.org/interviews/a-e/b.h.-barry|website=www.primarystagesoffcenter.org|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Allen Suddeth founded the National Fight Directors Training Program in the United States and wrote the book "Fight Direction for the Theater" (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.safd.org/MemberProfile/Details/31025|title=https://www.safd.org/MemberProfile/Details/31025|last=Suddeth|first=J.

Informal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the [https://www.safd.org/ Society of American Fight Directors] in 1977.

Following this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The [[British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)]] and [http://www.fdc.ca/ Fight Directors Canada (FDC)] in 1993; the [https://safdi.org.au/ Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi)] in 1994; the [http://nordicstagefight.com/ Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS)] and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; [http://www.artofcombat.org/ Art of Combat] in 1997; [http://www.stage-combat.de/ Stage Combat Deutschland] in 2004; and the [https://www.australianstagecombat.org.au/ Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA)] in 2010; [http://thebritishguildofstagecombat.blogspot.com/ The British Guild of Stage Combat] in 2015. As of 2005, [[East 15 Acting School]], [[London]] offered a [[B.A. (Hons)]] Degree in ''Acting &amp; Stage Combat.'' Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.

==Techniques==
[[File:Sword parts no scabbard.PNG|alt=Diagram of a sword and it's parts.|thumb|The parts of a sword.]]
Stage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques;  theatrical adaptations of various forms of [[historical fencing|fencing]] such as [[rapier]] and [[dagger]], [[smallsword]] and [[broadsword]], as well as the use of other weapons, notably the [[quarterstaff]] and [[knives]]; and more specialized skills such as [[professional wrestling]] and different styles of [[martial arts]]. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.

The over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.

Another important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The Society of American Fight Directors. ''Glossary of Terms''. Updated 3/19/16. http://www.safd.org.&lt;/ref&gt; This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. 

The combat phase of a play [[rehearsal]] is referred to as a ''fight rehearsal''. Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much [[training]] and [[experience]] as possible. A "fight call" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to "mark" through the fight to increase their [[muscle memory]]. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a ''fight captain'', who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. 

The fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escrime-ffe.fr/images/stories/FFE/PRATIQUER/LES-DIFFERENTES-PRATIQUES/ARTISTIQUE/Livret_Escrime_Artistique-web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017005544/http://escrime-ffe.fr/images/stories/FFE/PRATIQUER/LES-DIFFERENTES-PRATIQUES/ARTISTIQUE/Livret_Escrime_Artistique-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.

== Types of weapons used in stage combat ==
For stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.
[[File:Quarterstaff line drawing - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumb|Quarterstaff fight]]

=== Quarterstaff ===
Used in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular [[quarterstaff]] fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of [[Robin Hood]] from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the [[Bō|bō staff]] from the Japanese martial art [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]] which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous [[Kabuki]] play ''[[Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura]]'' written in 1748.

=== Broadsword ===
[[File:Rapier MET sfeah29.16.10 004.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Rapier sword.]]
A large sword commonly used in the early [[Middle Ages]] in Europe. The [[broadsword]] was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' and is also seen in fantasy epics like ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]''.

=== Rapier ===
First school instructing on the correct use of the [[rapier]] in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weapons in the theatre|last=Wise|first=Arthur|publisher=Barnes and Noble|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5, 123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonetti took over the lease from playwright [[John Lyly]] to open his school in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Methods and Practice of Elizabethan Swordplay|last=Turner|first=Craig|last2=Soper|first2=Tony|publisher=Southern University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Carbondale, IL|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.
[[File:The art of fencing, or, the use of the small sword Fleuron T123392-15.png|thumb|Two men dueling using the smallsword.]]

=== Smallsword ===
The [[Small sword|smallsword]] came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Hampton play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' by [[Christopher Hampton]] written in 1985, based on the 1782 [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|novel of the same name]].
[[File:Knife fighting practice. Training session led by Dmitry Dyomushkin – Photo 002.jpg|thumb|Two opponents face off in a knife fighting rehearsal.]]

=== Knife ===
There are many styles of knives from the [[Bowie knife]] to a [[switchblade]]. [[Knife fight|Knife fights]] tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in ''[[West Side Story]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of [[Georges Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]],'' written in 1875.

[[File:Arbo-Valkyrien 1864.jpg|thumb|Approximate size and shape of shield used in stage combat.]]

=== Sword and shield ===
The [[Shield|shields]] used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's [[Wars of the Roses]] history plays.

=== Unarmed ===
This consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as [[aikido]] and [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' when Othello strangles Desdemona.

=== Found Objects ===
Found objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, [[sugar glass]] molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.
[[File:Katana moderne.JPG|thumb|Example of a katana.]]

=== Japanese weapons ===
Other weapons like a [[katana]], a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and [[Nunchaku|nunchuks]] can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.
[[File:Battle-axe (PSF).png|thumb|Example of a battle axe.]]

=== Melee weapons ===
[[Melee weapon|Melee weapons]] are used in large battle scenes and can include [[Spear|spears]], [[Axe|axes]], [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[Flail (weapon)|flails]], and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.

==Realism in fight choreography==
Fight choreography can vary widely from true [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to outright [[fantasy]] depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)]], by [[Edmond Rostand]], using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.

One school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted [[suspension of disbelief]].

==Types of choreographed fights==

===In theater===
Having its roots in [[Medieval theatre]], stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]] ([[Shakespeare]]'s simple and oft seen stage direction, ''they fight'').

===On film===
{{main|Combat in film}}
[[File:The three musketeers fairbanks.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for [[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|''The Three Musketeers'']] (1921) starring Douglas Fairbanks.]]

Cinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;2007 Britannica, s.v. fencing.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with [[Errol Flynn]] from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in  the wake of
''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] puts it, "movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique".
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, the fights for which are choreographed by [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] &amp; Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V &amp; VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II &amp; III), tend to portray its [[lightsaber combat]] using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as [[lightsaber]]s or [[the Force]], whereas the action featured in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by [[Wolf System stage combat training|Tony Wolf]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Sonny Chiba]], [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Jackie Chan]], who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. [[Hong Kong]]-based fight choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]] is known for his work on ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]], in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as [[bullet time]]. [[Ching Siu-tung]] is particularly noted in the field of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] for his use of graceful [[wire fu]] techniques. By contrast, films such as ''[[The Duellists]]'', fight directed by William Hobbs, ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', fight directed by Robert Bruce and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' &amp;  [[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]], fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' movies.

===Combat reenactment===
{{main|Combat reenactment|Historical martial arts reconstruction}}

'''Combat reenactment''' is a side of [[historical reenactment]] which aims to depict events of battle, normally a specific engagement in history, but also unscripted battles where the 'winner' is not predetermined.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. ''Strange as It Seems'' was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.

It was syndicated domestically by [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] and internationally by [[United Press International]]. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'' and ''[[It Happened in Canada]]'' by Gordon Johnston.

By 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.

The cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.

John Hix died of [[myocarditis]] on June 6, 1944 (which was also [[D-Day]]). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.

==Radio show==
''Strange as It Seems'' was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. ''Strange as It Seems'' began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee Coast]] radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer [[daylight saving time]]). The sponsor was [[Ex‐Lax]]. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the ''Strange as It Seems'' stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by [[Gayne Whitman]], produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as "butterflies smell with their feet" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16" [[33 RPM]] records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was [[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive Shave Cream]] and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. ''Stranger Than Fiction'' was the successor to the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction #2 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.

===Gayne Whitman (announcer 1935–1939)===
Alfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name [[Gayne Whitman]], beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.

===Gordon "Felix" Mills (musical director (1935–1939)===
Gordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the [[Golden Age of Radio]] in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a "gadget band" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.

He was also the musical director for CBS Radio's ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.

===Cyril Armbrister (producer and director 1935–1939)===
Cyril Edward Armbrister was born on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]] on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', [[Terry and the Pirates (radio serial)|''Terry and the Pirates'']], and [[Land of the Lost (radio)|''Land of the Lost'']], among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]]. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.

===Alois Havrilla (announcer 1939‐1940)===
Alois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, "Tancuj, Tancuj," a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the ''[[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive]] Hour'' on [[NBC]] from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in 1934–1935 and the [[Paul Whiteman]] radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]] Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.

==Film shorts==
[[Warner Brothers]] released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'' cartoon series. [[Universal Studios]] responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip ''Strange as It Seems''. There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by [[Jerry Fairbanks]] &amp; Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by [[Gayne Whitman]].&lt;ref name="SAIS1"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183823/ Strange as It Seems #1 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black &amp; White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their ''[[Popular Science|Popular Science (film)]]'' films, his ''Strange as It Seems'' series was taken over by the [[Universal Studios]] newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed ''Stranger Than Fiction''. The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla &amp; James Wallington.&lt;ref name="STF2"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla.&lt;ref name="STF70"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1556701/ Stranger Than Fiction (1940) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films and a total of 149 short films, including the ''Stranger than Fiction'' series. Columbia Studios brought back the ''Strange as It Seems'' shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.

==Books==
The first ''Strange as It Seems'' book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, [[Eastern Color Printing]] published the ''John Hix Scrapbook''. In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.

There was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.

==Comic books==
Comic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for [[Ex-Lax]] (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and [[United Airlines]] (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.

==Exhibitions==
The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like [[Gold Gulch]] (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium''. A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair "61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix "Strange as It Seems" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.

==Archives==
The ''Strange as It Seems'' archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the ''Strange as It Seems'' productions currently published on their website and [[YouTube]] channel. According to the [http://www.strangeasitseems.com ''Strange as It Seems'' website], the archives are a "40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's &amp; 60's."

==Ripley vs. Hix==
Robert Ripley of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' and John Hix of ''Strange as It Seems'' competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: 
*Robert Ripley was 16 years older than John Hix so he had a head start based on his age.
*In 1918, Robert Ripley began publishing his cartoons in newspapers. John Hix began nationally syndicating his newspaper cartoons in 1928, ten years later. 
*In April 1930, Ripley aired his first radio show; Hix started his ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program in March, 1935. 
*In May 1930, Ripley released his first movie shorts through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]]. 3 months later in August 1930, Hix released his first film shorts through [[Universal Studios]]. 
*Ripley was selected for an exhibit at the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in 1935. Hix replaced him with an exhibit at the show in 1936. 
*And in 1939, Hix scooped Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. Ripley countered by opening the first of his Ripley's Odditoriums a few blocks from the fair.

They also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.

John McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], then [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.

At an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the ''Nautilus'', the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the ''Greenville Daily News'' as a staff artist for $5 a week.
He was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-[[collie]] and half-[[Water spaniel]], followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. 

He studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame),{{cn|date=November 2018}} John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design|Corcoran School of Art]]. 

He also started a daily one-column comic strip called ''Hicks by Hix'', featuring various wise-cracking [[Yokel|hick]] characters. It was syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate]].  The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with [[McClure Syndicate|McClure Newspapers]] in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called ''[[Frank Merriwell|Young Frank Merriwell]]'', written by [[Gilbert Patten]].&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/05/frank-merriwell-bulletin.html Stripper's Guide: A Frank Merriwell Bulletin!], May 30th, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as ''Frank Merriwell's Schooldays'' and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm).&lt;ref name=Frank /&gt; He also created a strip called ''[[O. Henry]]'s Short Stories''.&lt;ref name="OHenry"&gt;[https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/09/obscurity-of-day-o-henrys-short-stories.html "Obscurity of the Day: O. Henry's Short Stories,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (October 05, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he attended a few classes at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York. His dream was to attend the [[Yale School of Art]] where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.

''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'', drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of ''Strange as It Seems'' and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day ''Young Frank Merriwell'' debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, "If you doubt this, write for proof to the author." In the May 20, 1929 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. ''Time'' compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: "Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the January 4, 1930 edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, ''Strange as It Seems'' would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that [[George Washington]] was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.

John Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.
''Strange as It Seems'' became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the ''Strange as It Seems'' cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's ''[[Believe It Or Not!]]'' cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for [[Paramount Studios]] beginning in May 1930. 

[[Universal Studios]] offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first ''Strange as It Seems'' short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney brothers]] a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to [[Hollywood, California]], in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.

In the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee network]]. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, ''The John Hix Scrapbook'' was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]''. But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. 

In its heyday, it was reported that the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the [[Office of Emergency Management]] to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.

John's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of ''Strange as It Seems'', but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.

On Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 ([[D-Day]]). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced that there would be a private service coordinated by [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries|Forest Lawn]] Mortuary. John was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA]]. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.

===Ernest Hix===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the "Strange as It Seems" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.

The plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.
Joseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' work.

===Elsie Hix===
Elsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA.  Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany. They immigrated separately to the United States in their twenties and were married in Pennsylvania in 1894. Elsie Huber graduated from [[Cedar Crest College]] in 1928. From 1928 to 1930, she taught secretarial courses at [[Virginia Intermont College]] in Bristol, VA. In 1930, she became the Office Business Manager of Remington Rand Co. in [[Washington, D.C.]] She held this position until her marriage in 1932 to Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. After the family moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, from 1939 until 1964, she was the Executive Secretary to George E. Kinsey, a Los Angeles real estate investor, philanthropist and former president of the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] Commission. After the death of her husband in 1948 in a private plane crash, she took over the work of ''Strange as It Seems''. She was the writer of the comic strip for 15 years until 1963, when she turned it over to her son, Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. In 1964, she married Donald Lee Chamberlin. They were married until his death in 1976. From 1985 she lived in Glendora, CA. She died on December 9, 1995 in Glendale, CA and is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale.

===Phyllis and Ernest Hix, Jr.===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Sr. and Elsie Elizabeth Huber Hix. He wrote and produced the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip with his wife Phyllis from 1963 until the feature ceased production in 1970.

===Jeff Hix===
Jeffrey David Hix is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Phyllis Hix and is curator of the ''Strange as It Seems'' archives. Hix is reviving the ''Strange as It Seems'' brand for the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historivision.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6317">The '''Tel-musici''' was an early entertainment innovation, which used telephone lines to transmit phonograph recordings to individual households. Subscribers called a central "music room" to request selections, which they listened to at home over specially designed loudspeakers called "magnaphones". The service later incorporated live programs, expanding its operations to more along the lines of a general "[[telephone newspaper]]".

A Tel-musici company was incorporated in Delaware in 1908, and the service began operation in Wilmington the next year. However, although there were plans to expand throughout the United States, only this single location ever became operational, until it ceased operations around 1914.

==History==
[[File:1909 Tel-musici home installation.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Tel-musici service home installation&lt;ref name="distributing"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0k_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA698&amp;lpg=PA699&amp;dq=%22Distributing+Music+Over+Telephone+Lines%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nVezDY13wH&amp;sig=gcIHm7J9xojr-MDBeQEF68J3KWE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx98LnpMjMAhVIQyYKHU20A8kQ6AEIGjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Distributing%20Music%20Over%20Telephone%20Lines%22&amp;f=false "Distributing Music Over Telephone Lines"], ''Telephony'', December 18, 1909, pages 699-701.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary individual behind the Tel-musici was inventor George R. Webb. In January 1908, while soliciting for investors, he arranged a demonstration of the concept at a Baltimore hotel, where listeners telephoned a remote location with their requests, which were played back as "'10 cents' worth of [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]],' or 'a quarter's worth of ragtime'" to the assembled participants.&lt;ref&gt;"Melody by 'Phone", ''Baltimore Sun'', January 26, 1908, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, a Tel-musici company with a capitalization of $10,000 was incorporated in the state of Delaware by "a number of Baltimorians".&lt;ref&gt;"Telmusici Co. Incorporated", ''Music Trade Review'', February 1, 1908, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 an operating Tel-musici system was established in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] with George Webb as the company president, and J. J. Comer the general manager. The music rooms' musical library was described as comprehensive and "embracing a complete line of all the latest productions". The charge was three cents for each requested standard tune, and seven cents for grand opera. Subscribers were required to guarantee purchases totaling $18 per year. Provisions were also made for transmitting a general program in lieu of individual requests.&lt;ref name="distributing" /&gt;

The promoters hoped to interest local telephone companies in installing their own Tel-musici operations. The Wilmington operation was later taken over by the Wilmington and Philadelphia Traction Co., which operated a Wilmington telephone franchise, and an advertisement for a Tel-musici "dance music program" appeared as late as 1914.&lt;ref&gt;"Last and Best April Dance Program" (advertisement), ''Wilmington (Delaware) Morning Star'', April 26, 1914, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not appear that any additional installations became operational.

In 1912, George Webb began promoting the similarly conceived Magnaphone system, established in New York City, which was intended to transmit recording and other audio offerings to subscribers for eight dollars a month.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RlbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA808&amp;lpg=PA808&amp;dq=%22Something+Really+New%E2%80%94The+Magnaphone%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XG9w1By8CG&amp;sig=Lvf1P5DzqYGLGUBBeHh-pIarLR0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-iI-s6tHMAhWJ7oMKHc_XCnQQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Something%20Really%20New%E2%80%94The%20Magnaphone%22&amp;f=false "Something Really New—The Magnaphone"], ''Popular Electricity'', December, 1912, pages 808-810.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Magnaphone and Music Company was granted a twenty-five year franchise for operations "in the Borough of Manhattan and that part of the Borough of The Bronx west of the Bronx River", however, the franchise was never built. J. J. Comer would later participate, in conjunction with the [[Automatic Electric Company]] of Chicago, with development of the [[Musolaphone]] system, which briefly operated in southside Chicago, and which transmitted live news and entertainment to subscribing homes and businesses over telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WwXnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Increasing+the+Revenue+Producing+Efficiency+of+a+Plant%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gYHtN2Rcsy&amp;sig=x95MQdTuPMbv2lWFDkgsV1vUijo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD1cPmm8PMAhWDJCYKHa_fAyYQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Increasing%20the%20Revenue%20Producing%20Efficiency%20of%20a%20Plant%22&amp;f=false "Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant"] by Stanley R.

== The 2 AM Principle ==

In the book, Levy counters the commonly held phrase "[[Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.]]", by suggesting,  "nothing good happens after 2 AM except the most EPIC experiences of your life." In this statement, Levy is referring to the EPIC model of Adventure.

Levy postulates that all adventures follow a four-stage process.  He attempts to prove this by using personal anecdotes and scientific research to show how it can be applied to everyday life.

== About the Author ==

'''''The Three Bogatyrs''''' (Три богатыря) is an [[Animation|animated]] [[Franchising|franchise]] produced by [[Melnitsa Animation Studio]]. Voices of [[Sergey Makovetsky]], [[Dmitry Vysotsky]], [[Liya Medvedeva]], [[Valery Soloviev]], [[Oleg Kulikovich]], [[Oleg Tabakov]], [[Anatoly Petrov]], [[Andrei Tolubeyev]] and [[Fedor Bondarchuk|Fyodor Bondarchuk]] with [[Elizaveta Boyarskaya]] are featured in the films. The overall plot through the series follows the adventures of three most famous [[bogatyr]]s: [[Alyosha Popovich]], [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] and [[Ilya Muromets]].

The series has now grossed over $135 million, making it the most high-grossing Russian animated films and earning a spot as one of the most profitable Russian films in the last 10 years.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

This animated film is anachronistic, following the lead of the other films in this series. Set in medieval times, this film combines history of [[Kievan Rus|early Russia]] and Slavic and [[Russian folklore]] with more modern elements including a nod to [[Alexander Pushkin]] and video games. Each of the first three films featured one of the [[bogatyr]]s, Russian epic heroes, based very loosely on the heroes in the legends about [[Prince Vladimir]] in the Kievan-Rus’ bylina cycle, a collection of traditional Russian oral epic narrative poems. The fourth film, The Three Bogatyrs and the Shamakhan Queen, unites all three of the bogatyrs, Alyosha Popovich, Ilya Muromets and Dobrynya Nikitych, in one film and includes unforgettable sidekicks such as Julius the talking horse, introduced in the previous films. Unlike the other three animated features, this film also makes reference to the Russian literature from 19th century and the famous narrative epic of Alexander Pushkin: [[The Tale of the Golden Cockerel]] (Сказка о золотом петушке, 1834) with the addition of the Shamakhan Queen.

The commercial success of this series has been increasing since the release of the first film in 2004, in part, because of such marketing.

The Three Bogatyrs and the Shamakhan Queen or How Not to Rescue a Princess is the fourth film in the animated series and was released December 30, 2010.

The DVD was released on 17 February 2011 and during the first six weeks made 566,731,786 rubles, breaking the record for Russian animated films and earning a spot as one of the most profitable Russian films in the last 10 years.

===''Three Heroes on Distant Shores'' (2012)===
{{Main|Three Heroes on Distant Shores}}
In English-speaking countries it was distributed as "Three Bogatyrs far far away", which was commercially successful despite rather negative reviews.

Kolyvan and Baba Yaga plan to take over the palace of the Prince of Kiev. They succeed in their attempt with the help of a singular army—two enormous bunnies. They also create a fake source of legitimation, the doubles of the three bogatyrs, who affirm that the charlatans are the legitimate successors of the Prince. In the meantime, with the help of further magic, Baba Yaga banishes the real bogatyrs to a remote shore. The plot develops through various episodes involving the impostors with their bunnies, the Prince of Kiev with the horse Iulii, the bogatyrs’ wives with the doubles, the real bogatyrs with the indigenous people and a giant gorilla, and the appearance of some characters from the previous series—Tikhon, babka and the dragon Gorynych.

The film is perhaps most successful in presenting a straight criticism on Russian society and rulers. A satire that is undoubtedly addressed at contemporary Russia, but that has in itself recurrent traits of satirical works emerging at different times during the Russian and Soviet era: infatuation with foreign products, blind awe towards foreigners, ineptitude of the rulers to govern, corruption, unfair tax collection, high prices on produce, and swift acceptance of new impostors without any opposition. This type of satirical accent acquires even more weight when followed by shots of nationalist characters, such as the beautiful domes of the village that assume different colors from the reflection of the rising sun.

To the contrary of many contemporary foreign animated films, Three Bogatyrs relies more on traditional, drawn animation than on computer graphics. As in many animation movies made in Russia, characters and scenes are first drawn, scanned, and only then do computer animators fill in the tasks of coloring, adding  backgrounds and special effects. Computers help the construction of the film and offer some special features, but the process of drawing successfully preserves the film from the cold and artificial effect that is common to pure computer animation.

===''Three heroes. Horse Course'' (2015)===
{{Main|Three heroes. Horse Course}}
Known also as "Roundabout way and new adventures of ancient Bogatyrs".

Court horse named Julius Caesar is at the hub of activity. The horse is supposed to save the grand duke of Kiev while the Bogatyrs are absent trying to catch the robber. The evil goes further eventually planning to take over not ancient Russia but over the whole world.
The villain is represented by a living oak tree who gambles and outplays simpletons. The second bad guy is a robber named Potanya.

'''''Trivial Pursuit''''' is a [[board game]] from [[Canada]] in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer [[trivia|general knowledge]] and [[popular culture]] questions.

Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al tie-ins (such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movies).

==History==
The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in [[Quebec]], by Canadian [[Chris Haney (Trivial Pursuit)|Chris Haney]], a photo editor for Montreal's ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', and [[Scott Abbott]], a sports editor for ''[[The Canadian Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit History |publisher=ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding pieces of their ''[[Scrabble]]'' game missing, they decided to create their own game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_trivia_pursuit.htm |title=The History of '&amp;#39;Trivial Pursuit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"/&gt;

In [[North America]], the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of TRIVIAL PURSUIT|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm|website=The Great Idea Finder|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the game were initially licensed to [[Selchow and Righter]] in 1982, then to [[Parker Brothers]] (now part of [[Hasbro]]) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the [[Virgin Group]]; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/03/31/trivial-sale.html |title=Trivial Pursuit sells for a non-trivial sum: $80 million US |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of [[Elroy, Wisconsin]] produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the "Games Hall of Fame" by [[Games (magazine)|''Games'' magazine]]. An online version of ''Trivial Pursuit'' was launched in September 2003.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/092903.html |title=Trivial Pursuit Launches Online Version |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=29 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Trivialpursuit Token.jpg|thumb|A ''Trivial Pursuit'' playing piece, with all six wedges filled]]
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', these are [[Geography]] (blue), [[Entertainment]] (pink), [[History]] (yellow), Arts &amp; [[Literature]] (originally brown, later purple), [[Science]] &amp; [[Nature]] (green), and [[Sports]] &amp; Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.

Playing pieces used in ''Trivial Pursuit'' are round and divided into six sections, similar to a [[cheese spread|cheese triangle]]. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelfox|first1=Hilarie|title=Tried and tested family games for Christmas|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/13-board-games-keep-family-12326946|work=Huddersfield Examiner|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.

During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal "hub" space. At the end of each spoke is a "category headquarters" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say "roll again," giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a "wild" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

==Editions==
[[File:Trivial Pursuit.jpg|thumb|Board and pieces of Trivial Pursuit.]]
{{Main article|List of Trivial Pursuit editions}}
Over the years, numerous editions of ''Trivial Pursuit'' have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the ''Genus'' edition (or ''Genus I''). Several other general knowledge editions (such as ''Genus II'') have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.

In the United Kingdom, ''Trivial Pursuit'' players complained that the 2006 version of the game was "[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537151/Trivial-brain-teasers-enrage-games-fans.html |title=Trivial 'brain-teasers' enrage game's fans |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=17 December 2006 |first1=Beth |last1=Jones |first2=Julie |last2=Henry |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==

===Fred Worth lawsuit===
In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Super Trivia'', and ''Super Trivia II'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of ''Trivial Pursuit''. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and [[fictitious entry|deliberately placed misinformation]]. One of the questions in ''Trivial Pursuit'' was "What was [[Columbo (character)|Columbo]]'s first name?" with the answer "Philip". That information had been [[Fictitious entry|fabricated to catch]] anyone who might try to [[Copyright infringement|violate his copyright]].&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598%2C4685968| publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Courier]]| location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]| title=Trivial Suit| date=25 October 1984| last=Overend| first=William| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors of ''Trivial Pursuit'' acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the ''Trivial Pursuit'' inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the ruling.&lt;ref name=9cir&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Company |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=596 |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/827/569/3179/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worth asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to review the case, but the Court declined, denying [[certiorari]] in March 1988.&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Co. |vol=485 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=977 |date=1988 |url=http://wy.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac./SCT/1988/19880328_0041517.SCT.htm/qx}} (''cert. denied.'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Wall lawsuit===
In 1994, David Wall of [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]], launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.

Wall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a ''Trivial Pursuit''-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.

Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] ruled against Wall.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962864.htm |title=Hitchhiker loses Trivial Pursuit rights battle | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]] |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
{{See also|Trivial Pursuit (U.S. game show)||Trivial Pursuit (UK game show)|Trivial Pursuit: America Plays}}
A version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], aired on [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]] in the [[United States]] from 1993 to 1995 ([[Jay Wolpert]] had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version entitled ''[[Trivial Pursuit: America Plays]]'' aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In September 2004, [[Roger Lodge]] hosted a sports trivia game show on [[ESPN]] entitled ''ESPN Trivial Pursuit'', which aired five episodes.

[[BBC Television]] produced a ''Trivial Pursuit'' [[game show]] based on the game in the [[UK]] hosted by [[Rory McGrath]]. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on [[Challenge TV|The Family Channel (now Challenge)]] by [[Tony Slattery]]. [[Birgit Lechtermann]] hosted a version for [[VOX (TV channel)|VOX]] in [[Germany]] from 1993 to 1994.

In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled ''Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit'' aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of [[Jimmy Buffett]] and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.

In [[Spain]], a version of the show called ''Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays'' premiered in September 2008 on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]].&lt;ref name=antenna3&gt;{{cite news| title=Trivial deals, new gameshow for Debmar-Mercury| url=http://www.c21media.net/trivial-deals-new-gameshow-for-debmar-mercury/?ss=trivial+pursuit+spain| publisher=C21 Media| last=Grant| first=Jules| date=6 April 2008| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcade game===
In 1984, [[Bally Sente]] released a ''Trivial Pursuit'' arcade game.&lt;ref name=arcade&gt;{{cite web| title=Trivial Pursuit| url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10199| publisher=International Arcade Museum| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the board game, several variants were also released.

===Home computer games===
British software company [[Domark]] released a home computer version (billed as ''Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game'') for multiple formats during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="page6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.page6.org/archive/issue_26/page_24.htm |title=Issue 26 - Trivial Pursuit| publisher=Page 6| date=March–April 1987| last=Davison| first=John S. |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpcpower"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&amp;onglet=jaquette&amp;num=2297| title=Trivial Pursuit Edition Genus |publisher=cpc-power.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zxsoftware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|title=ZXSoftware.co.uk|publisher=ZXSoftware.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2012-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309145154/http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|archivedate=2013-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemon64"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3125 |title=Trivial Pursuit: Commodore-Genus Edition |publisher=Lemon64.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version included pictorial and musical questions&lt;ref name="ysorig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=November 1986 |first=Gwen |last=Hughes |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618224434/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |archive-date=2014-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.

Later, Domark released another version called ''Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning'', also across multiple formats.&lt;ref name="lemon64new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3475 |title=Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning |publisher=Lemon64.com |date=1988 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ysnew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |title=Trivial Pursuits - A New Beginning |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=January 1989 |first=Phil |last=South |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619011101/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |archive-date=2014-06-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version featured a plot about the dying Earth&lt;ref name="incredibly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incrediblystrangegames.com/post/1166003331/trivial-pursuit-a-strange-new-beginning |title=Trivial Pursuit: A Strange New Beginning |publisher=Incredibly Strange Games |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="ysnew"/&gt;

[[Hasbro Interactive]] released a "Millennium Edition" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:
*''Classic Pursuit'': Played just like the board game.  A "QUICKPLAY" option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question.  Up to six can play.  The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer.
*''Party Pursuit'': Up to three can play.  The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from.  A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category.  The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game.  After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players.
*''Point Pursuit'': Same as ''Party Pursuit,'' except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points.  Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question.  Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.

There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online game===
In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of ''Trivial Pursuit'' on the now-defunct website Uproar.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20031118005445/en/Trivial-Pursuit-Online-Games-Brings-Worlds-Popular|title=Trivial Pursuit Online Games Brings World's Most Popular Trivia Game to Uproar.com|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040204013755/http://www.uproar.com/promos/trivialpursuit/ Trivial Pursuit on Uproar]&lt;/ref&gt;where it features five editions such as: ''Genius'', ''Silver Screen'', ''Music'', ''1980s'' and ''TV''.

===Video games===
Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including [[Sega CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Trivial Pursuit|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ign.com/games/hasbro-game-channel-trivial-pursuit-live/ps4-20022843 Trivial Pursuit Live! on PlayStation 4], ign.com&lt;/ref&gt; The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called ''[[Trivia Crack]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4135">'''Virtual Print Fee''' (VPF) is a subsidy paid by a [[film distributor]] towards the purchase of [[digital cinema]] projection equipment for use by a [[film exhibitor]] in the presentation of first release motion pictures.  The subsidy is paid in the form of a fee per booking of a movie, intended to match the savings that occurs by not shipping a film print.  The model is designed to help redistribute the savings realized by studios when using digital distribution instead of film print distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkpe.com/digital_cinema/faqs/|title=Digital Cinema Business FAQs|first=MKPE Consulting|last=LLC|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first public demonstration of digital projection for cinema took place at ShoWest in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital cinema#Technology demonstrations and system prototyping]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was readily apparent that the technology was further ahead than the business model.  Early technology presentations attempted to claim that the technology would pay for itself through new revenues generated by new forms of content. But exhibitors knew their audience, and could see that digital projection was only a replacement technology, creating new financial liabilities, and not new revenue.  It wasn’t until the rollout of digital 3-D years later in 2005 that digital projection demonstrated that it could be used to generate additional revenue.

The economics were challenging.  Film projectors and platters cost in the neighborhood of US$30,000, while early digital projectors cost up to US$150,000.  Further, film projectors had a lifetime of 30 years with relatively small annual expenditures in maintenance and replacement parts.  On the other hand, exhibitors felt they would be lucky to get 10 years of service from a digital projector, after which there would have to be a refresh in capital expenditure.  Meanwhile, distributors would realize significant savings by eliminating the high cost of film prints with corresponding shipping costs, and instead distributing digital files either by satellite or hard drive. 

The Virtual Print Fee was designed to better balance savings and expenditures for both exhibitors and distributors.  It is intended to primarily assist in the replacement of film projectors, and not assist in the purchase of new projection equipment for new construction.  To give confidence to financial institutions that digital cinema technology was stable and worthy of investment, [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] was created in 2002, resulting in the release of the first version of the DCI Digital Cinema System Specification in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcimovies.com|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) - DIGITAL CINEMA SYSTEM SPECIFICATION, VERSION 1.2|first=|last=companyv|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DCI Specification continues to be the core specification for digital cinema, establishing the baseline technology and system requirements for which studios will release digital movies.

The first set of VPF agreements executed with four major studios were announced by Christie/AIX in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.cinedigm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=210434|title=NEW SONY PICTURES AGREEMENT WITH CHRISTIE/AIX SUPPORTS DIGITAL CINEMA TRANSITION (NASDAQ:CIDM)|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christie/AIX at that time was a subsidiary of Access Integrated Technology, now renamed [[Cinedigm]] Digital Cinema Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinedigm.com/|title=Home - Cinedigm|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The agreements were for the rollout of digital cinema technology to 4000 screens.  Since that time, numerous other Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements have been executed around the world, allowing exhibitors in nearly every territory to benefit from VPF subsidies in the conversion from film projection to digital projection.
