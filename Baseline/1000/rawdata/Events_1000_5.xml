An '''accident''', also known as an '''unintentional injury''', is an undesirable, incidental, and an unplanned event that could have been prevented had [[Attendant circumstance|circumstances]] leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.&lt;ref name=Robertson2015&gt;{{cite book | last = Robertson | first = Leon S. | title = Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition | year = 2015 | publisher = Lulu Books | url = http://www.nanlee.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical and non-physical===
Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, moving objects, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a [[secret]] or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.

===By activity===
* Accidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called [[work accident]]s. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm ILO Safety and Health at Work]". International Labour Organization (ILO)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, [[leisure]]-related accidents are mainly [[Sports injury|sports injuries]].

===By vehicle===

* [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Aviation]]
* [[Bicycle safety|Bicycles]]
* [[Sailing ships]]

==Common causes==
{{See also|Preventable causes of death}}
[[File:Accidents.svg|thumb|300px|Incidence of accidents (of a severity of resulting in seeking medical care), sorted by activity (in Denmark in 2002).]]
Poisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States [[National Center for Health Statistics]], falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runyan CW, Casteel C, Perkis D |title=Unintentional injuries in the home in the United States Part I: mortality |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=73–9 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15626560 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.09.010 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]].&lt;ref name=NEISS&gt;CPSC. [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/General-Information/National-Electronic-Injury-Surveillance-System-NEISS/ National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)]. Database query available through: [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/ NEISS Injury Data].&lt;/ref&gt; This program was revised in 2000 to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products.&lt;ref name=NEISS/&gt; Data on [[emergency department]] visits is also collected through the [[National Health Interview Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;NCHS. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/ervisits.htm Emergency Department Visits]. CDC.&lt;/ref&gt; In The U.S. the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has available on their website extensive statistics on workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif|title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|author=|date=|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident models==

Many models to characterize and analyze accidents have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;A long list of books and papers is given in: {{cite book|title=Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health|date=2004|author=Taylor, G.A.|author2=Easter, K.M.|author3=Hegney, R.P.|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0750661976|pages=241–245, see also pages 140–141 and pages 147–153, also on Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can by classified by type.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

'''''Bloodline''''' &lt;ref&gt;''Bloodline'' DVD (Cinema Libre, 2008, 113 minutes). The documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190537/ IMDb entry]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2008 [[documentary film]] by [[Bruce Burgess]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benhammott.com/rennes-le-chateau_tomb_page-2.html |title=Ben Hammott's page about ''Bloodline'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001074401/http://benhammott.com/rennes-le-chateau_tomb_page-2.html |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a filmmaker with an interest in [[paranormal]] claims, focused on the "[[Jesus bloodline]]" hypothesis and other elements of the book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Special report|the television program with the same name|Special Report (Fox News program)|other uses|Breaking news (disambiguation)}}
'''Breaking news''', interchangeably termed '''late-breaking news''' and also known as a '''special report''' or '''special coverage''' or '''news bulletin''', is a [[news|current issue]] that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always Free Online|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/breaking-news|author=Christopher Merrill|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Breaking News –  Journalism Terms|url=http://journalism.about.com/od/journalismglossary/g/breakingnews.htm|publisher=Journalism.about.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, breaking news is used after the news organization has already reported on the story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is sometimes used instead.

==Formats==
===Television===
The format of a ''special report'' or ''breaking news'' event on television commonly consists of the current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts) suddenly switching to a reverse countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any [[Network affiliate|affiliated stations]] to switch to the network news feed (television stations typically do not provide these countdowns for local coverage, normally leading with a graphic and/or voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to join the network news feed.
There is then an opening graphic, featuring music (such as [[NBC]]'s "[[The Mission (theme music)|The Pulse of Events]]", composed by [[John Williams]]) which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. This is usually followed by the introduction of a [[news anchor]], who welcomes the viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. [[Lower thirds]] and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of urgency. 

Once the story is introduced, the network or local station may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be passed to a [[reporter]] at the location of the breaking event, possibly sharing more information about the story as it breaks.

Depending upon the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or continue for multiple hours – or with the longest uninterrupted news events, four days – at a time (events in which the latter instances has occurred include the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], which took place between November 22–26, 1963 and September 11–15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, [[communications satellite|satellite]], [[broadband]] (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending on the severity of the event, regular [[television commercial|commercial advertising]] may be completely suspended for sustained coverage, and network affiliates will be required to insert their [[station identification]] in at the top of the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual means of a station imaging promo or program reminder. 

If a story occurs during the [[Dayparting|Early Fringe]] timeslot and depending on the magnitude of the events at hand, local stations might be given the opportunity to break away from the network feed and begin their evening newscasts. This is set up by a cue from the network's talent that they will pause for a few seconds to reset coverage, at which point an opening graphic may be rolled again. Information is also disseminated from an internal alert service utilized by a station's [[master control]]. After the local newscast, stations will likely return to the network's feed as they normally would for the nightly news, but they may be joining in on an "extended edition". Whether or not a station will take over for local news is usually the choice of that station's [[news director]].

When the coverage comes to a close, the network or station may either resume programming that was occurring prior to the event or begin new programming (if the breaking news occurs during a newscast the network will switch back to the newscast upon completion if time permits), depending upon the amount of time spent on the coverage. The anchor will usually remind viewers to check the network's website (or that of the station, if coverage is provided locally), or watch any [[United States cable news|cable news]] channels that may be co-owned with the network for more information. If the story breaks during daytime programming, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be or might be more details on their local news that day and a full wrap-up on the network's evening news program. Usually, regular daytime programming is re-joined in progress and segments may be missed.

If the event occurs during [[prime time]], the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be more details on their late local newscast and on the network's [[breakfast television|overnight news program]] (if applicable) the next morning. Programming at this time is either joined in progress or started back up at the point of the interruption, depending on whether the program is new to air, highly rated or has time left in its time slot to finish airing (for instance, [[ABC News (United States)|ABC]]'s breaking news report involving the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat missile strike]] took into account a new episode of the popular series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', where the show was resumed right at the point of interruption twice for those reports; [[NBC]]'s coverage featured the low-rated ''[[The Blacklist: Redemption]]'' joined in the middle of an episode in progress after their special report without any of that consideration). In either of the above instances, network (and in some cases, for local stations, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]]) programs that have segments not aired or are pre-empted in their entirety by breaking news reports – particularly those that extend to or longer than 20 or 45 minutes, depending on the length of the previously scheduled program – may have to be rescheduled to air at a later time. 

Some events, like [[State of the Union address]]es and [[United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], are scheduled to start at the top of the hour during prime time. Under those circumstances, regularly scheduled network programming is preempted for the entire duration of the event. If there is sufficient time (generally 60 minutes or more) remaining in prime time, the network may broadcast its next regularly scheduled program in its entirety or join regularly scheduled programming in progress. However, if there is insufficient time remaining for any prime-time programs, the special report will continue until the network affiliates begin airing their late local newscasts.

In the United States, on days when [[United States presidential elections|presidential elections]] take place, regularly scheduled prime-time programming is suspended so that networks can air up-to-the-minute coverage of the elections. Likewise, regularly scheduled daytime programs are suspended during coverage of [[United States presidential inaugurations|presidential inaugurations]]. However, during those types of events, regular commercial advertising is shown. Similar procedures are enacted for elections or political inaugurations that take place in other countries.

===Radio===
On radio, the process of a breaking news story is somewhat the same, though some different considerations are made for the medium. For instance, a breaking news theme is required by default to have an urgent tenor and be used only for the purpose of true breaking news or bulletins. This is obvious on the local [[all-news radio]] stations owned by [[Entercom]] (formerly owned by [[CBS Radio]]), which very rarely use a breaking news theme for all but the most urgent and dire of breaking news, and is purposefully structured to give a sense of attention for the listener, almost sounding like an alarm. For local events, continuous coverage may be imposed, or else the station may wait until they have a reporter at the scene and will promise more details of the event as they become available.

National news that is broadcast over a [[radio network]] requires constant monitoring by station employees to allow the network coverage to air, although many stations will take the 'urgent' signal sent by the network and break into programming immediately. Again, continuous coverage from a national radio network depends on the severity of the event, and often the network may just pass down the coverage by their local affiliate with spare commentary by the network's anchors.

Other considerations are made also; FM music stations rarely relay breaking news unless it is an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either in the form of updates provided by an on-staff anchor or [[disc jockey]], an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.

==Usage==
News bulletins have been a fixture of radio broadcasting since at least the 1920s. Examples of early news bulletins in the [[Golden Age of Radio]] include fictionalized versions in the 1938 radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and coverage of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which was also the first television news bulletin, reported on stations in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles is credited with being the first television station to provide extended coverage of a breaking news event: for 27½ hours from April 8 to 9, 1949, the station carried live coverage of an attempt to rescue three-year-old [[Kathy Fiscus]], who had fallen down an abandoned well in [[San Marino, California]], where she ultimately perished due to [[asphyxia]] from a lack of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Kathy Fiscus Story: Turning Point in TV News|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-kathy-fiscus-story-19890408-story.html|author=[[Stan Chambers]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 8, 1989|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Television News Pioneer Stan Chambers Dies at 91|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/los-angeles-television-news-pioneer-stan-chambers-dies-28953145|website=[[ABC News]]|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades before 24-hour news networks such as [[CNN]] began to exist, programming interruptions were restricted to extremely urgent news, such as the death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as "breaking news" coverage was for the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, (with [[CBS News]] anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]]'s [[Walter Cronkite#Kennedy assassination|coverage]] being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour [[news channel]]s, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as [[Sky News]], largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being "''first for breaking news''".

Another type of breaking news is that of [[severe weather]] events, which had such coverage evolve in a very similar manner. In [[North America]] until the 1990s, television and radio stations normally only provided long-form weather coverage during immediate, ongoing threats (such as a [[tornado]] that has been confirmed visually or by [[Doppler weather radar|radar]] to be producing damage or a landfalling [[hurricane]]); cut-ins and, in the case of television stations, [[news ticker|alert crawls]] during regular programming were used otherwise, even when higher-end alerts such as [[tornado warning]]s were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History (and Future) of Tornado Warning Dissemination in the United States|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1|author=Timothy A. Coleman|author2=Kevin R. Knupp|author3=[[James Spann]]|author4=J. B. Elliot|author5=Brian E. Peters|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=May 2011 |doi=10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1 |volume=92 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |pages=567–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in newsgathering and weather technology (including the deployment of [[helicopter]]s to provide aerial coverage and radar systems that can detect specific storm attributes), coupled with a few highly life-threatening events during the 1990s (such as [[Hurricane Andrew]] and the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]) and the resulting heightened urgency to advise those in the storm's path to take safety precautions in advance made extended (or "wall-to-wall") weather coverage once a high-end alert is issued more common in storm-prone areas, with cut-ins only being used in weather events of lesser severity.

In various countries and at various news outlets, terms such as "(late)breaking", "urgent", "flash", "bulletin", and "alert" may accompany breaking news reports. The term ''breaking news'' has come to replace the older use of ''news bulletin'', with the latter term relegated to only the most extraordinary of events. There has been widespread use of ''breaking news'' at the local level, particularly when one station in a [[media market|market]] wants to emphasize the exclusivity of coverage. Not all viewers agree that stories assigned as ''breaking news'' rise to the significance or level of interest that warrant such a designation.

American network news divisions still use the term ''special report'' for either a breaking news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out Latest Breaking News Headlines|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a developing news story or both, but tend to use the term ''breaking news'' on their [[Breakfast television|morning]] and evening news programs. Most local stations across the United States that interrupt regular programming for a news story use the ''breaking news'' and ''special report'' terms (though, local broadcast news outlets use the former most often), with a voice-over stating either "This is a breaking news special report" or "This is a special breaking news report" or "This is a(n) (network name) News Special Report" or "This is a(n) (station brand name) breaking news (special) report" or "(From [station brand name],) this is breaking news." The breaking news ending has a past-tense variation, followed by a disclaimer for viewers who would like more information to see the network's news division website.

However, "special report" has also been de-emphasized by cable news channels in the United States, as both Fox News Channel and CNN now use that phrase for regular programming; Fox News carries ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', a daily political affairs program, while CNN's ''Special Report'' is a catch-all banner for CNN's library documentary and [[true crime]] programming.

==Criticism==
In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited information that is available at the time. For example, during the [[Sago Mine disaster]], there were initial reports that all twelve miners were found alive, but news organizations later learned that only one actually survived.

Often it is considered important to be quick with news bulletins also for less important news. Such news might not be updated later, even if it was found that information was wrong or severely incomplete. If someone (e.g. when editing Wikipedia) later wants to research the event, only incomplete information might be found.

[[File:MSNBC 12-28-17 breaking news.jpg|right|thumb|An example of "breaking news" with no new developments, seen in a screenshot of [[MSNBC]]'s [[The 11th Hour (news program)|''The 11th Hour'']], on December 28, 2017 describing events from August 2017 during the [[2017–18 North Korea crisis]].]]

Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of "breaking news" by the need of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news channels]] to fill time, applying the title to [[soft news]] stories of questionable importance and urgency (for example, [[car chase]]s). Others question as to whether the use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Is Breaking News… Not?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|work=InsideTheCBC.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101055/http://insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|archivedate=2008-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs, such as [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]]'s defunct ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'', used the term for recurring coverage of events which occurred months before, even when [[criminal trial]] coverage which may deserve the breaking news tag was not occurring and no new information has developed.

In June 2013, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WDRB]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] gained notice in the television industry for a [[promo (media)|promo]] that criticized the broad and constant use of the "breaking news" term, explaining that it has been overused as a "marketing ploy" by other news-producing stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, on its website, WDRB posted "Contracts" with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to use "breaking news" judiciously (applying it to stories that are "both 'breaking' and 'news'").&lt;ref name=TVSpy06042013&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisville Station Stops Using 'Breaking News'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/louisville-station-stops-using-breaking-news_b92526|work=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a '''calendar year''' begins on the [[New Year's Day]] of the given [[calendar]] system and ends on the day before the following New Year's Day, and thus consists of a whole number of days. A year can also be measured by starting on any other named day of the calendar, and ending on the day before this named day in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calendar%20year | title=calendar year | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be termed a "year's time", but not a "calendar year".  To reconcile the calendar year with the astronomical cycle (which has a fractional number of days) certain years contain [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra days]] ("leap days" or "intercalary days").

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year, which is in use in most of the world, begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. It has a length of 365 days in an [[common year|ordinary year]], with 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes, or 31,536,000 seconds; but 366 days in a [[leap year]], with 8,784 hours, 527,040 minutes, or 31,622,400 seconds. With 97 leap years every 400 years, the year has an average length of 365.2425 days. Other formula-based calendars can have lengths which are further out of step with the solar cycle: for example, the [[Julian calendar]] has an average length of 365.25 days, and the [[Hebrew calendar]] has an average length of 365.2468 days. The [[Islamic calendar]] is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 [[lunar month|months]] in a year of 354 or 355 days.

The astronomer's [[mean tropical year]], which is averaged over equinoxes and solstices, is currently 365.24219 days, slightly shorter than the average length of the year in most calendars, but the astronomer's value changes over time, so [[William Herschel]]'s suggested correction to the Gregorian calendar may become unnecessary by the year 4000.

==Quarters==
The calendar year can be divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

* First quarter, Q1: 1 January – 31 March (90 days or 91 days in leap years)
* Second quarter, Q2: 1 April – 30 June (91 days)
* Third quarter, Q3: 1 July – 30 September (92 days)
* Fourth quarter, Q4: 1 October – 31 December (92 days)

When combined with a year, the quarter/year combination may be written, for example, as Q4{{CURRENTYEAR}} or 4Q{{CURRENTYEAR}} or {{CURRENTYEAR}}Q4.

[[Image:Mount St. Helens, one day before the devastating eruption.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Conical mountain|[[Mount St. Helens]], 9:00 am, May 17, 1980.]]
[[File:MSH80 eruption mount st helens 05-18-80.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Eruption column around 8:35 am on May 18, 1980.]]

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J. R. |year=2005 |title=Where Did The Moon Come From? |journal= [[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume= 129 | issue=3 | pages= 1724–1745 |arxiv=astro-ph/0405372 |bibcode=2005AJ....129.1724B |doi=10.1086/427539 |last1=Belbruno |first2=J.

A '''common year''' is a [[calendar year]] with 365 [[day]]s.  More generally, a common year is one without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]].  The [[Gregorian calendar]], (like the earlier [[Julian calendar]]), employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the [[tropical year]], which does not contain an exact number of days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 [[week]]s and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the [[Revised Julian calendar]] (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

In most instances, the effect is a rather negative one as it has disrupted many Africans’ traditional norms and practices. For instance, many West African communities rely on [[Traditional African medicine|traditional healers]] and [[witch doctors]], who use herbal remedies, massage, chant, and witchcraft to cure just about any ailment.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update 3 July 2014|publisher=WHO|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |title=West African Cultural Norms/Traditions That May Impact Ebola Transmission |publisher=HCA |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109123732/http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is difficult for West Africans to adapt to foreign medical practices. Specifically, West African resistance to Western medicine is prominent in the region, which calls for severe distrust of Western and modern medical personnel and practices.{{small|(see [[Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis#Ebola conspiracies|Ebola conspiracies]] below.)}}&lt;ref name=Gassel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publichealth.tufts.edu/About-Us/Public-Health-Rounds-Newsletter/How-Cultural-Norms-and-Practices-Impact-Ebola-OutbreakPage |title=How Cultural Norms and Practices Impact Ebola Outbreak |author= Sammi Gassel&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Tufts University |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, some African cultures have a traditional [[solidarity]] of standing by the sick, which is contrary to the safe care of an Ebola patient.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; This tradition is known as "standing by the ill" in order to show one's respect and honor to the patient. According to the Wesley Medical Center, these sorts of traditional norms can be dangerous to those not infected with the virus as it increases their chances of coming in contract with their family member's bodily fluids.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; In [[Liberia]], Ebola has wiped out entire families, leaving perhaps one survivor to recount stories of how they simply could not be hands off while their loved ones were sick in bed, because of their culture of touch, hold, hug and kiss.&lt;ref name="nyt20141005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html|title=Ebola’s Cultural Casualty: Hugs in Hands-On Liberia|publisher=The New York Times|first=Helene|last=Cooper|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities traditionally use [[folklore]] and mythical literature, which is often passed on verbally from one generation to the next to explain the interrelationships of all things that exist. However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song "White Ebola" was released by a [[diaspora]] based group and centers on the general distrust of "outsiders" who may be intentionally infecting people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|title=A brief background and history of African literatures|publisher=Exploring Africa|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culanth592"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|title=Beats, Rhymes and Ebola|publisher=Boima Tucker|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This initial misinformation increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: "No Ebola in West Point." Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-workers-battle-trust-issues-attacks-in-ebola-outbreak/|title=Health workers battle trust issues, attacks in Ebola outbreak|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients/|title=Report: Armed men attack Liberia Ebola clinic, freeing patients|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guinea]], riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in [[Nzerekore]]. Locals rumored that the medics were actually spreading the disease. In nearby [[Massacre at Womey|Womey]], 8 people distributing information about Ebola were killed by the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443|title=Ebola outbreak: Guinea health team killed|publisher=BBC News|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== West African cultural traditions and norms==
[[File:Response volunteers in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|right|Volunteers distribute health information in Nigeria.]]
The Ebola epidemic of 2014 has forced West Africans to face numerous difficulties on daily basis regarding their traditional norms and practices. In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for the African community, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased’s father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Specifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a "love touch."  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person’s spirit, also known as "tibo," will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;

===Resistance to Western medicine===
Resistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Due to the mistrust Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.&lt;ref name=Ravi&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301–305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sierra Leone health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.&lt;ref name=Ravi/&gt; In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

Resistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the African families.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; Lastly, the interference in the family’s care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family’s duty to provide comfort and care.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person’s blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

===Traditional medical practices===
Apart from the fact that traditional African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

== Personal account of a West African student==

Alakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that "everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the "uncivilized" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were "protective of their property", space, and time. She concluded that American society is "extremely individualistic". This truly made her miss living in Africa, "... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not "feel like the same place" anymore.

==Bushmeat==
The Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to [[bushmeat]], which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source. Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily get the virus from bats. Hunters usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.&lt;ref name=camghana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/understanding-the-bushmeat-market-why-do-people-risk-infection-from-bat-meat|title=Understanding the bushmeat market: why do people risk infection from bat meat?|work=Research News|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hogenboom | first1 = Melissa | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29604204 | publisher = BBC News | title = Ebola: Is bushmeat behind the outbreak? | date = October 18, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the suspected [[index case]] for the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola outbreak in West Africa]] is a two-year-old child in [[Guéckédou Prefecture|Guéckédou]] in south-eastern Guinea, who was the child of a family that hunted two species of fruit bat,&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt; ''[[Hammer-headed bat|Hypsignathus monstrosus]]'' and ''[[Franquet's epauletted fruit bat|Epomops franqueti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/voice-field/struggling-contain-ebola-epidemic-west-africa | publisher = MSF USA | title = Struggling to Contain the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa | date = July 8, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggested the case was caused by [[Zoonosis|zoonotic transmission]] though the child playing with an [[Microbat|insectivorous bat]] from a colony of [[Angolan free-tailed bat]]s near the village.&lt;ref name=EMBOMM123014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Almudena Marí Saéz |author2=Sabrina Weiss |author3=Kathrin Nowak |author4=Vincent Lapeyre |author5=Fee Zimmermann |author6=Ariane Düx |author7=Hjalmar S Kühl |author8=Moussa Kaba |author9=Sebastien Regnaut |author10=Kevin Merkel |author11=Andreas Sachse |author12=Ulla Thiesen |author13=Lili Villányi |author14=Christophe Boesch |author15=Piotr W Dabrowski |author16=Aleksandar Radonić |author17=Andreas Nitsche |author18=Siv Aina J Leendertz |author19=Stefan Petterson |author20=Stephan Becker |author21=Verena Krähling |author22=Emmanuel Couacy‐Hymann |author23=Chantal Akoua‐Koffi |author24=Natalie Weber |author25=Lars Schaade |author26=Jakob Fahr |author27=Matthias Borchert |author28=Jan F Gogarten |author29=Sébastien Calvignac‐Spencer |author30=Fabian H Leendertz |title=Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic|journal=EMBO Molecular Medicine|date=December 30, 2014|issue=Published online|doi=10.15252/emmm.201404792|url=http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792|accessdate=December 31, 2014|publisher=EMBO Press|format=online|quote=The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa likely stems from a single zoonotic transmission event involving a 2‐year‐old boy in Meliandou, Guinea, who might have been infected by hunting or playing with insectivorous free‐tailed bats living in a nearby hollow tree|volume=7|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/|title=Ground zero in Guinea: the outbreak smoulders – undetected – for more than 3 months|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/239123/icode/|title=FAO warns of fruit bat risk in West African Ebola epidemic|work=FAO|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_151010.html|title=Bushmeat consumption, wildlife trade and global public health risks|work=FAO|date=15 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ebola conspiracies ==
* The ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', a major Liberian newspaper, has repeatedly published Ebola-related conspiracy theories. In September 2014 it published an article claiming that Ebola and the [[HIV|AIDS virus]] are [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] to be used as [[Biological warfare|bio-weapons]] on Africans in an attempt to reduce Africa’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod|title=Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/17/the-major-liberian-newspaper-churning-out-ebola-conspiracy-after-conspiracy/  "The major Liberian newspaper churning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy", [[The Washington Post]], Terrence McCoy, October 17, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October the story went viral on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2014/10/28/Is-the-US-manufacturing-the-Ebola-virus-with-HIV|title=Claims of US manufacturing Ebola with HIV go viral|author=Jean-Jacques Cornish|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa developed in 2014, a number of popular self-published and well-reviewed books containing sensational and misleading information about the disease appeared in electronic and printed formats. The authors of some such books admitted that they lacked medical credentials and were not technically qualified to give medical advice. The World Health Organization and the United Nations stated that such misinformation had contributed to the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/02/popular-on-amazon-wildly-misleading-self-published-books-about-ebola-by-random-people-without-medical-degrees/|title=Popular on Amazon: Wildly misleading self-published books about Ebola, by random people without medical degrees|date=2 October 2014|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Liberia, some body-collection teams dispatched to collect the Ebola dead have collected bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that their dead relative did not die from Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim would also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families do not want to admit that their relative died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give their relative a traditional burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=Heidi|last=Vogt|date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late October 2014 it was reported that harassment of gay Liberians in Monrovia was occurring after some church leaders said that "God was angry with Liberians over corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality, and that Ebola was a punishment". The harassment included car windows being smashed and some gay people were forced from their homes and had to go into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-foundation-ebola-liberia-gay-idUSKCN0IC1GV20141023?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews|title= "Gay community under attack in Liberia over Ebola outbreak", Reuters, Misha Hussain and Maria Caspani, October 23, 2014.|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of Ebola-themed jokes circulating in West Africa to spread awareness.&lt;ref name="Bloom20140827"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-27/tell-me-the-one-about-ebola-how-jokes-spread-awareness.html|title=Tell Me the One About Ebola: How Jokes Spread Awareness|publisher=Bloomberg|author1=Pauline Bax|author2=Makiko Kitamura|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Liberian Football Association made an announcement that all soccer related activities would be put on hold "''indefinitely to protect players and fans''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28542577|title=Ebola outbreak: Liberia suspends football|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, in a joint venture between [[FIFA]] and [[WHO]], the [[Antoinette Tubman Stadium]] was converted into an Ebola treatment center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-12/monrovia-soccer-stadium-to-house-ebola-centre-fifa/5738710|title=Ebola outbreak: Soccer stadium in Liberia to be converted to virus treatment centre, FIFA says|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[African Cup of Nations]] (AFCON) was temporarily put on hold when the original hosts, [[Morocco]], asked the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) to postpone the final games till 2016, due to the Ebola outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30004279|title=Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco will not host finals over Ebola fears|publisher=BBC|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAF eventually moved the finals to [[Equatorial Guinea]], which eliminated Morocco from the game as hosts, and brought Equatorial Guinea in, even though they had been eliminated prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30053859|title=2015 Nations Cup: Equatorial Guinea to host tournament|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the qualifiers for 2015 AFCON have been influenced by many countries' fear of Ebola, with many refusing to enter or allow entry of teams from affected countries. In July 2014, [[Seychelles]] refused entry to the Sierra Leone team. CAF ruled that Seychelles forfeited the game, giving Sierra Leone an automatic pass to the next stage. [[Lesotho]] refused to send the [[African Youth Championship|Under-20]] team to [[Nigeria]]. CAF again ruled that Lesotho forfeited the game, sending Nigeria through to the finals.&lt;ref name="f24201408"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140824-african-football-struggles-play-amid-ebola-outbreak-cup-of-nations/|title=African football in disarray amid Ebola outbreak|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, CAF also decided to forbid any official games in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. For Liberia, who had already been eliminated, this was not of concern.&lt;ref name="f24201408" /&gt; Sierra Leone managed to move some home games to the visiting teams home; both home and away games against [[DR Congo]] were played in [[Lubumbashi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28995543|title=Sierra Leone move Afcon tie with DR Congo to Lubumbashi|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both games against [[Cameroon]] were played in [[Yaounde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29330276|title=Nations Cup 2015: Cameroon and Sierra Leone find venues|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea managed to get their home games moved to [[Casablanca]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28844477|title=Guinea move Togo 2015 Nations Cup qualifier to Morocco|publisher=BBC|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after calls to have the 2015 AFCON postponed, the Equatorial Guinea government and CAF organisers have downplayed these concerns, and insisted that they would have ample measures in place, including: {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*Temperature check for all passengers arriving at the international airports.

On 7 August 2014 a social media hoax message was doing the rounds in [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa#Nigeria|Nigeria]]. It urged readers to "''bath with hot water and salt before daybreak''" and to drink as much of it as possible. On 8 August the person who started the joke message to see how many of their friends would fall for it, identified it as such and posted an apology.&lt;ref name="dt17323"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/notes-from-atlanta/17323-understanding-how-the-salt-and-water-ebola-cure-hoax-spread-in-nigeria|title=Understanding how the salt-and-water Ebola cure hoax spread in Nigeria|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Farooq|last=Kperogi|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/salt-water-ebola-remedy-hoax.shtml|title=Salt Water Ebola Prevention Hoax Leads to Deaths|publisher=hoax slayer|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax message quickly went viral when "''several gullible, unsophisticated opinion leaders''" repeated the hoax message.&lt;ref name="dt17323" /&gt; Within days many were hospitalized due to excessive salt intake, with 2 deaths in [[Jos]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.view.com.ng/ebola-virus-two-die-after-drinking-salt-water-in-jos/|title=Ebola Virus, Two die after drinking salt water in Jos|publisher=View|author=Clems|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 deaths in [[Benué State|Makurdi, Benue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2014/08/14/ebola-two-nigerians-die-drinking-bathing-hot-salt-water/|title=Ebola: Two more Nigerians die drinking, bathing with hot salt water|publisher=Daily Post|first=Adenike|last=Orenuga|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 3 deaths in [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/four-feared-dead-intake-salt-water-bauchi/|title=Four feared dead after intake of salt water in Bauchi|publisher=Vanguard|first=Suzan|last=Edeh|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is ironic that these deaths all happened in states that had no known EVD infected people. In fact only [[Lagos State]] and [[Rivers State]] had any infected. Furthermore, the unconfirmed death toll of the hoax cure is as many as the EVD death toll for Nigeria, with 8 deaths each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1|title=WHO: Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report|publisher=WHO|date=1 October 2014|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/features/17359-ebola-more-deaths-from-salt-therapy-than-virus|title=Ebola: More deaths from "salt therapy" than virus|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Onimisi|last=Alao|author2=Hassan Ibrahim|author3=Ahmed Mohammed|author4=Hope Abah|author5=Femi Akinola|author6=Lagos|author7=Judd-Leonard Okafor|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two separate incidents in October, flights have been delayed from disembarking because of an Ebola joke. On 8 October 2014, [[US Airways]] flight 845 from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Punta Cana]], [[Dominican Republic]] was held up for two hours on the tarmac when an American passenger sneezed, then announced "I have Ebola. You're all screwed," during the flight. After landing, he was escorted off the plane by four emergency personnel wearing blue [[hazmat suit]]s, and detained until medical tests cleared him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/10/355108686/ebola-joke-triggers-passengers-removal-from-us-airways-flight|title=Ebola Joke Triggers Passenger's Removal From US Airways Flight|publisher=NPR|first=Scott|last=Neuman|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2787292/Hazmat-team-rushed-meet-US-plane-Dominican-Republic-passenger-sneezed-yelled-I-Ebola-poor-taste-joke.html|title=What NOT to say on a plane: American passenger bundled off U.S. to Dominican Republic flight by hazmat team after sneezing and joking 'I have Ebola!'|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Mia De Graaf|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2014, during the [[Aer Lingus]] flight EI 433, from [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] a passenger wrote "'Attenzione Ebola'" ("Attention Ebola") on a coffee lid before handing it to his daughter.

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L.

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros.

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

A '''disaster area''' is a region or a locale, heavily damaged by either natural, technological or social hazards. Disaster areas affect the population living in the community by dramatic increase in expense, loss of energy, food and services; and finally increase the risk of disease for citizens. An area that has been struck with a natural, technological or sociological hazard that opens the affected area for national or international aid.

==Natural hazard==
A natural hazard is a negative process of phenomena created naturally (tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes) that will affect people or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/GeographyVocabularyGCSEFarming.htm |title=Geography vocabulary: Gcse farming|year=February 2012|website=www.geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornadoes===
'''[[Tornado]]es''' are narrow aggressively rotating mixtures of air that come from the base of a thunderstorm, being the most violent of storms. Tornadoes are usually hard to see unless they form a condensations funnel made from:- dust, water droplets and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSL: Severe Weather 101: Tornadoes. NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes take place in several parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Africa but mostly occur in the United States, Argentina, and Bangladesh.

===Hurricanes===
[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumbnail| New York City after the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]]]]

'''[[Hurricane]]s''', [[cyclones]], [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] can be referred to as the same. They combine low pressure and strong winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones have a low pressure center, rain and strong winds. They usually initiate over tropical or subtropical waters. Hurricanes can be predicted several days before they hit and can be very destructive and destroy homes and some other buildings. Cyclones, although they are the same type of storm, are harder to predict before a few days like hurricanes thus giving people only a few hours of notice to evacuate their homes. In this case there are far more deaths from flooding and high tides. A recent (2012) example of a hurricane is [[Hurricane Sandy]], which was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States, leaving millions without power and a few homeless.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 30, 2012|title= Sandy death toll rises, millions without power in u.s|via= CBC News|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/10/30/us-hurricane-sandy-superstorm-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
'''Floods''' take place when water overflows or submerges land that is usually parched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floods |work=[[IFRC]] |date=November 5, 2012|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/floods/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. A floodplain is produced when water from a rivers spreads through the land from excessive rain, rapid ice melting, unfortunately placed beaver dam, and ruptured dam. There are two types of floods: general and flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Information, Flooding Facts, Flash Floods, Photos -- National Geographic. Environment Facts, Environment Science, Global Warming, Natural Disasters, Ecosystems, Green Living |website= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date= November 5, 2012|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/floods-profile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; General floods are predicted well in advance and usually cause the destruction of housing, people and crops. Flash floods come without warning and are sudden and extreme: A large volume of water flows rapidly and people have to make quick movements if they do not want to be caught in the flood. They have to find high safe ground where the water will not reach them.

===Earthquakes===
When two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past each other in the fault of the earth, it is called an earthquake. Energy released in many forms moves in all directions and causes the ground to shake.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title= Seismic Sources – Earthquakes, Nuclear Blasts, Mining Events|work= Canada's Natural Resources|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/info-gen/faq-eng.php#where}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes earthquakes may have foreshocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region which is followed by a larger earthquake. The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the Earth. 90% of the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.

==Technological hazards==
===Technical hazards===

[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Fukushima I [[Nuclear Power Plant]] after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Reactor 1 to 4 from left to right.]]
There are several technical hazards one should be aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are measured in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. Technical hazards are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these technical hazards.

===Nuclear and radiation (accidents/incidents)===
There are several thoughts that come to mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”,&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}	&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials."&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt; To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt;

===Nuclear accident===
'''Nuclear accidents''' are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. There are several examples of these nuclear accidents taken place around the world. To start off, a prime example of a [[nuclear accident]] would be [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|Palo mares B-52 Accident]]. On January 17, 1966, a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52]] [[bomber]] collided with a mid-tanker airplane that was being refueled at 31000 feet. When the two airplanes collided, the tanker airplane exploded completely killing all crew members, while the B-52 bomber split in half killing a small proportion of the crew. When the airplane split in half, four bombs dropped from the sky. Two of them detonated, causing 2 kilometers of land to be contaminated by radioactive plutonium. The fourth explosive was recovered when it was discovered that it landed on the sea. The soil on the contaminated area had to be removed and placed in barrels, to reduce the amount of pollution having been caused by the nuclear explosive.

===Nuclear incident===
'''Nuclear incidents''' are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url= http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set off 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated, the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from [[radioactive contamination]] that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present at the site of the explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.

==Sociological hazards==
Sociological hazards that create a disaster area are [[riots]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].

===Riot===
A riot is defined as a noisy, violent public disturbance caused by  a group or a crowd (three or more people) usually protesting against another group or government policy in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riot -  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK London riot in August 2011, for example, was started due to the shooting of [[Mark Duggan]] by the London police.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuchs|first= C. |year=2012|title= Behind the News: Social Media, Riots and Revolution. Capital and Class, 36(3), 383-391|accessdate=November 1, 2012 |url=http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/383.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters came together destroying neighborhoods and streets violently damaging property to protest the police's actions that happened a few days prior.&lt;ref name="Fuchs" /&gt; Riots increase expenses to repair costly damages putting the city in distress.

===Terrorism===
[[File:North face south tower after plane strike 9-11.jpg|thumb|[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] burning down during the [[9/11 attacks]].]]

Terrorism is defined as acts of violence and threats by a group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism|title=terrorism|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism occurs with an unexpected attack on [[non-combatants]] to create fear and panic having a detrimental consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism. The American Heritage: New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition|date= November 5, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist attacks]] create a massive, costly impact on the society. Not only is there large amount of property damage that may not be able to be repaired, there is also a large impact on citizens. People lose loved ones and suffer from their own health being impacted. The [[9/11|9/11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in [[New York City]] marks one of the largest attacks on the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1= H.|last2= Keenan|first2= K. |year=2012|title= The Impact of 9/11 on the Geography of Financial Services in New York. The Professional Geographer, 64(3), 370-388|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twin Towers were completely destroyed, damaging the surrounding buildings as well as causing the loss of many lives. People suffered from health problems from inhaling the sediments from the crumbling towers. The financial and social impact is still present thirteen years later in today's society.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; It is concluded that New York City still suffers from a post-disaster decline in financial services.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; New York City is a Disaster area due to the sociological hazard of terrorism.

===War===
War defined as a period where conflict is carried out as an act of hostility by [[armed forces]] between two or more nations or [[Civil war|within a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/war war]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, for example would be a sociological hazard causing disaster areas because it is considered a war zone. There has been an ongoing battle between United States and the Taliban in Afghanistan resulting in a war zone.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first= M. |year=2011|title=They were Hunting and Killing Us: Abc News' Mike Boettcher Caught in Taliban Firefight with U.S. Troops in Afghanistan|work= ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-mike-boettcher-caught-taliban-firefight-us/story?id=13702376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant bombing and shooting marks up Afghanistan destructing property, land and causing threats to the civilians living in the area.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Thousands have died and international aid for the cost of the war is implemented through tax payers.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; There is lack of resources due to the war area cutting off access to areas because of violence and danger.

==Examples of modern disaster areas==
An example of a '''technological disaster''' was the Fukushima disaster which was caused by a “massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake [that] hit northeast Japan”.&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst Nuclear Accidents / Disasters in History|year=2011| accessdate=November 5, 2012|url= http://www.smashinglists.com/worst-nuclear-accidents-disasters-in-history/|website=www.smashinglists.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earthquake caused a [[nuclear explosion]] at a power plant; five reactors were damaged, causing the plant to go into an emergency state. All this occurred because there was a technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power, causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health, as the area suffered nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt; and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone. Luckily, the “Japanese government [handled] the situation in the most efficient and amazing way that anyone can imagine.”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt;

A recent example of a disaster area caused by a '''natural hazard''' is [[Hurricane Sandy]] which hit October 27, 2012. It was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States. The storm killed about 50 people and many were also hit by falling trees. The hardest-hit state was New York, leaving millions without power and a few homeless. 

A disaster area caused by a '''sociological hazard''' would be the terrorist attack on [[September 11th, 2001]], in New York City. Two airplanes struck the Twin Towers, causing them to crumble, killing many people in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masud|first= E. |year=2006|title= What Really Happened on September 11 Remains a Mystery |work=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate= November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y2002/0427-Mystery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected attack harmed many people and had a detrimental impact on New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Earth Hour''' is a worldwide movement organized by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).  The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earthhour.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started as a lights-off event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/Earth_Hour_Report_2017.pdf|title=Earth Hour 2017 report|author=|first=|date=|website=www.earthhour.org|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, in years when [[Holy Saturday]] falls on the last Saturday of March, Earth Hour is moved a week early rather than its traditional date.

Earth Hour 2018 was on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.

Earth Hour 2019 is scheduled for March 30, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/earthhour|title=Earth Hour (@earthhour) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Conception and start: 2004–2007===
In 2004, confronted with scientific findings, WWF Australia met with advertising agency [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Sydney]] to "discuss ideas for engaging Australians on the issue of climate change".&lt;ref name="earthhour1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |title=history |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103047/http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a large scale switch off was coined and developed in 2006, originally under the working title "The Big Flick".  WWF Australia presented their concept to [[Fairfax Media]] who, along with Sydney Lord Mayor [[Clover Moore]], agreed to back the event.&lt;ref name="earthhour1"/&gt; The 2007 Earth Hour was held on March 31 in Sydney, Australia at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, local time.

In October 2007 San Francisco ran its own "Lights Out" program inspired by the Sydney Earth Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/19/local/me-lightsout19 |title= Hour leg of darkness | newspaper = [[LA Times]] | date = September 19, 2007| author = John M. Glionna}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their successful event in October, the organizers decided to rally behind the Earth Hour being planned for March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightsoutsf.org/2007/10/24/moving-forward/ |title=Moving forward &amp;#124; Lights Out San Francisco |publisher=Lightsoutsf.org |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Hour 2008 was held internationally on March 29, 2008 from 8&amp;nbsp;pm to 9&amp;nbsp;pm local time, marking the first anniversary of the event. 35 countries around the world participated as official flagship cities and over 400 cities also supported. Landmarks around the world turned off their non-essential lighting for Earth Hour. Some websites took part in the event, with Google's homepage going "dark" on the day .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cities Shut Lights for Earth Hour 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/03/29/world-cities-shut-lights-for-earth-hour-2008/|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Zogby International online survey, 36 million Americans—approximately 16 percent of the United States adult population—participated in Earth Hour 2008. The survey also showed there was a 4 percentage point increase in the level of interest in environmental issues such as climate change and pollution directly after the event (73 percent pre-event versus 77 percent post-event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/21/idUS134396+21-Apr-2008+BW20080421 | title = 36 Million Americans Take Part in World Wildlife Fund's Global 'Earth Hour' | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = April 28, 2008 | accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to WWF Thailand, [[Bangkok]] decreased electricity usage by 73.34 [[megawatts]], which, [[megawatt-hour|over one hour]], is equivalent to 41.6 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/03/29/earth-hour.html |title= Canadians go dark with world for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20080330/281500746965118 Bangkok Post]'' gave different figures of 165 [[megawatt-hours]] and 102 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]]. This was noted to be significantly less than a similar campaign initiated by Bangkok's City Hall the previous year in May, when 530 megawatt-hours were saved and 143 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide emission]] were cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/30Mar2008_news03.php|title=Lights out campaign disappointing: Bangkok helps save very little energy |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 |publisher=[[Bangkok Post]]}} {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]] used approximately 900 megawatt-hours less electrical energy during Earth Hour. At one point, [[Toronto]] saw an 8.7% reduction in consumption as compared to a typical March Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/EarthHour/article/407246 |title= Toronto hits energy target |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dubai]], where external lighting on several major city landmarks was turned off and street lighting in selected areas was dimmed by 50%, the Electricity and Water Authority reported savings of 100 megawatt-hours of electricity. This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the hour began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/515051-dubai-slashes-energy-use-for-earth-hour?ln=en |title= Dubai slashes energy use for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Arabian Business]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best result was from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, with the city reporting a drop of 13% in electricity demand. However, national grid operator [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] reported that New Zealand's power consumption during Earth Hour was 335 megawatts, higher than the 328 megawatt average of the previous two Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4457620a11.html Lights on, power use up for Earth Hour]. Kelly Andrew. ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''. Monday, March 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]], Australia reduced demand by 10.1%. Sydney, being the city that participated in both the 2007 and 2008 Earth Hours, cut electricity consumption by 8.4%. This is less than the previous year's 10.2%; however, Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley made the claim that after factoring [[margin of error]], the participation in this city was the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/407472 |title= Where do we go from here? |work=[[Toronto Star]] |pages=A1, A17 |date= March 31, 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-31 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Hour 2009 was from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm local time, March 28, 2009. The campaign was titled "Vote Earth" and was dubbed "the world's first global vote" with one billion votes was the stated aim for Earth Hour 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2009/02/vote-earth-worlds-first-global.html |title=Vote Earth – Leo Burnett to Launch the World's First Global Election |work=Campaign Brief Australia |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the pivotal [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

Despite official organizers WWF stating that the event is not about the reduction in electricity, a number of public institutions reported on electricity savings in their cities to see participation numbers. The [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], excluding the city of [[Toronto]], saw a decrease of 6% in electricity usage while [[Toronto]] saw a decrease of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) as many businesses darkened, including the landmark [[CN Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090329/earth_hour_090329/20090329?hub=TorontoHome |title=CTV Toronto – Earth Hour prompts 15 per cent T.O. power drop – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States polling showed that an estimated 90,000,000 Americans participated in Earth Hour as lights were turned off around the country, including landmarks such as [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Las Vegas Strip]], the [[Empire State Building]] and [[Niagara Falls]].

Some cities and landmarks took the opportunity to make more long-term adjustments to their everyday power consumption. In Chicago, the [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] (BOMA) developed lighting guidelines to reduce light pollution and reduce the carbon footprint of downtown buildings. [[Mount Rushmore]] in [[South Dakota]] started powering down each night around 9&amp;nbsp;pm instead of 11&amp;nbsp;pm.

===2011===
Earth Hour 2011 was the biggest year in the campaign's five-year history, reaffirming it as the largest ever voluntary action for the environment. In 2011, the tagline "Beyond the Hour" was adopted by organizers as a way to encourage people to take their commitment to the cause beyond the 60-minute event. Together with agency Leo Burnett, Earth Hour unveiled an updated planet themed logo that included a small plus symbol to the right of the signature "60" which was used in previous years. The 60+ symbol continues to be the main logo used by campaign organizers around the world.

Earth Hour 2011 took place in a record 5,251 cities and towns in 135 countries and territories on all seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |title=about |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330132314/http://www.earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an estimated reach of 1.8&amp;nbsp;billion people across the globe. In addition to this, the campaign's digital footprint grew to 91 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |title=#Earthhour Heats Up on Social Media |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628120010/http://earthhour.org/blog/earthhour-heats-social-media |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Earth Hour 2011 was held on March 26, 2011 from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm. IST, flagged off by the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]] [[Sheila Dikshit]] and Earth Hour 2011 Ambassador and Bollywood actress [[Vidya Balan]] in the presence of Jim Leape, Director General, WWF International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.indiaprwire.com/pressrelease/environmental-services/2011032881849.htm|title=India switches off on March 26 from 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm and beyond|publisher=India PRwire|date = March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosebowl channel suspended broadcasting from 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9.30&amp;nbsp;pm to mark the observance of Earth Hour.

The [[Philippines]], which has been an active participant of the Earth Hour, had an early "earth hour" when power was accidentally interrupted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatdulla and Villanueva|first=Rodina and Donabelle|title=Earth Hour comes early in Metro |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=670245&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=68&amp;newsalert|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plunging Metro Manila and nearby [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] into darkness. After power was restored, major buildings, commercial centers and residential areas in Metro Manila and most [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] continued to turn off their lights, while participating channels in the Philippines, ABS-CBN and Cartoon Network halted their transmissions for an hour.

30 provinces and cities in Vietnam took part in Earth Hour 2011 with the main event held in [[Nha Trang]]. The nation's electricity demand fell 400,000&amp;nbsp;kWh, one-fifth less than the previous year's. Vietnam managed to save 500 million [[VND]] (US$23,809) thanks to the saved power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |title=Vietnam Foreign Press Center – Vietnam saves 400,000 kWh of power during Earth Hour |publisher=Presscenter.org.vn |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322162359/http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube promoted the Earth Hour by changing its logo, and by adding a switch on/off feature near the title of each video, so that users could change the background colour from white to black.

One of the least co-operative areas traditionally has been [[Alberta]]; in 2008, Calgary's power consumption went up during Earth Hour. The trend continued in 2011 when [[Edmonton]]'s power usage also increased. While [[Calgary]]'s power usage went down in 2011 during the event, electricity officials could not distinguish their readings between normal usage and a conscious attempt to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/03/28/edmonton-earth-hour-failure.html |title=No Energy for Earth Hour |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of reduction in electricity use==
The Earth Hour Global FAQ page states:
{{Quote|Earth Hour does not purport to be an energy/[[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction]] exercise, it is a symbolic action. Therefore, we do not engage in the measurement of energy/carbon reduction levels for the hour itself. Earth Hour is an initiative to encourage individuals, businesses and governments around the world to take accountability for their [[ecological footprint]] and engage in dialogue and resource exchange that provides real solutions to our environmental challenges. Participation in Earth Hour symbolizes a commitment to change beyond the hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/celebrating-earth-hour |title=Celebrating Earth Hour |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 2014 study published in ''Energy Research and Social Science'' compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour in 10 countries, spanning 6 years, and found that the events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000474|title=The electricity impacts of Earth Hour: An international comparative analysis of energy-saving behavior|accessdate=May 31, 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.014|volume=2|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted the policy challenge of converting Earth Hour's short-term energy saving into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behaviour and investment.

==Criticism==

[[Bjørn Lomborg]], author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', wrote, "It is vital to make [[solar power|solar]] and [[green energy|other new technology]] cheaper than fossil fuels quickly so we can turn off carbon energy sources for a lot longer than one hour and keep the planet running... Fossil fuels literally gave us an enlightenment, by lighting our world and giving us protection from the fury of the elements.

Other criticisms of Earth Hour have included the following:  
* Some critics point out that the reduction in power consumption during Earth Hour itself is relatively insignificant.&lt;ref name = "rage against dimming"&gt;{{cite news | last = Soloman | first = David | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21694864-7583,00.html | title = Rage, rage against dimming of the light | publisher = The Australian | date = May 9, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Herald Sun]]'' equated the power savings in the Sydney central business district to "taking 48,613 cars off the road for 1 hour".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Australian columnist [[Andrew Bolt]] pointed out that "A cut so tiny is trivial – equal to taking six cars off the road for a year".&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Andrew (March 28, 2008).

*Other environmentalists have criticized Earth Hour's focus on individual behaviour, when a small number of fossil fuel companies have emitted the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainababble.fish/?p=101|title=Sustainababble Podcast - Earth Hour|last=|first=|date=29 March 2015|website=|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam McGibbon, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Earth Hour for releasing fossil fuel companies and politicians from their responsibility to deal with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/earth-hour-climate-change-environment-fossil-fuels-boycott-make-change-happen-really-care-a7643971.html|title=If you really care about climate change, boycott Earth Hour|date=2017-03-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that most candles are made from [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], a heavy [[hydrocarbon]] derived from [[crude oil]], a [[fossil fuel]], and that depending on how many candles a person burns (if one uses candles during Earth Hour), whether or not they normally use [[compact fluorescent light]] bulbs, and what source of energy is used to produce their electricity, in some cases, replacing light bulbs with candles will cause an increase, instead of a decrease, in carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/03/27/does-lighting-candles-for-earth-hour-defeat-the-purpose/ Does lighting candles for Earth Hour defeat the purpose?], ''Christian Science Monitor'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2009, one day after Earth Hour 2009, ''Dân Trí Daily News'' published an editorial expressing concern that many young people chose to drive around the darkened city of [[Hanoi]] for fun, exhausting petroleum instead of electricity and resulting in long traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dantri.com.vn/xa-hoi/cai-nhin-khac-trong-gio-trai-dat-316112.htm "Cái nhìn khác trong Giờ Trái đất"], ''Dân Trí Daily News'', by Cường Cao, date: 2009-03-29. {{vi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network criticized Earth Hour for "playing into the hands of (the critics of environmentalists)," as darkness is symbolic of fear and decay.  "The overwhelming need at the moment is to inspire ordinary people with a vision of a better world, to make them feel that action on climate change is utterly desirable and positive.... the cultural resonance (of Earth Hour) couldn't be any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions|title=Earth Hour: Turning out the lights plays into the hands of our critics|last=Marshall|first=George|date=2009-03-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has introduced an opposing ''Human Achievement Hour'' in celebration of human progress in various fields of industry, including technology, medicine, energy, and more. During this hour, the Institute suggests that people celebrate by using modern technology such as electricity, telecommunications and indoor plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/content/human-achievement-hour-2015|title=Human Achievement Hour 2015|work=cei.org|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2009, economist [[Ross McKitrick]] criticized the idea, saying, "Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century.[...] The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/earthhour.pdf | title=Earth Hour: A Dissent | last=McKitrick | first=Ross | authorlink=Ross McKitrick | year=2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' quoted Ross Hayman, head of media relations at the [[UK National Grid]], as saying "it could therefore result in an increase in carbon emissions" due to complications related to rapidly lowering then raising electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7527469/Earth-Hour-will-not-cut-carbon-emissions.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Earth Hour 'will not cut carbon emissions' | date=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2010, Rick Giles, president of [[ACT on Campus]], the youth wing of New Zealand's [[ACT Party]], appeared on the [[morning television]] show ''[[Sunrise (New Zealand TV program)|Sunrise]]'' to denounce Earth Hour and instead suggested the celebration of "Edison Hour". He argued that Earth Hour is an "anti-technology" cause, and that people will simply use candles instead, which is undesirable as they are petroleum-based. He argued that if we are heading for some kind of disaster, it makes sense to use technology to combat this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9MqNzQuuk |title=I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it |publisher=YouTube |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick said "I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it".
* The [[Ayn Rand Institute]] wrote, "Participants spend an enjoyable sixty minutes in the dark, safe in the knowledge that the life-saving benefits of industrial civilization are just a light switch away... Forget one measly hour with just the lights off. How about Earth Month...

* During the 2010 Earth Hour in the city of [[Uusikaupunki]] in Finland, a 17-year-old female motorcyclist hit a 71-year-old man, who was walking on the street instead of the sidewalk for an unknown reason. The man died from his injuries, while the motorcyclist and her passenger were uninjured. At the time of the accident the street lights had been turned off as part of the Earth Hour. The police stated that the lack of street lighting may have played a part in the accident, while the mayor believed the city's street lights would have been too dim to prevent it even if they had been on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mies kuoli moottoripyörän alle pimeystempauksen pimentämällä tiellä | work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] | url = &lt;!-- http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Mies+kuoli+moottoripy%C3%B6r%C3%A4n+alle+pimeystempauksen+piment%C3%A4m%C3%A4ll%C3%A4+tiell%C3%A4/1135255005911 --&gt;http://hommaforum.org/index.php?topic=25901.5;imode | date=March 27, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-28 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaupunki sammutti katuvalot Earth Hourin ajaksi – Mies jäi moottoripyörän alle pimeällä tiellä ja kuoli |work=[[Aamulehti]] |url=http://www.aamulehti.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/174590.shtml |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-28 |language=Finnish }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EgyptAir Flight 648''' was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens [[Ellinikon International Airport]] in Greece and [[Cairo International Airport]] in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a [[Boeing 737-200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 11241985 |publisher=Airdisaster.com |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085212/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by the terrorist organization [[Abu Nidal]]. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates – Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

The Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pallás and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre – The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi – Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta – a decision reversed too late – contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, ''Miles to Go Before I Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackie Nink Pflug|author2=Peter Kizilos|title=Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royVNfdQE6cC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2001|publisher=Hazelden Publishing|isbn=978-1-56838-837-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an ''[[Interpol Investigates]]'' episode, [[Interpol Investigates#Terror in the Skies|"Terror in the Skies"]], broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]].

The hijacking is also the subject of the book ''Valinda, Our Daughter'', written by Canadian author [[Gladys Taylor (publisher)|Gladys Taylor]].

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in [[Brad Thor]]'s novel Path of the Assassin.

==History==

Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the [[Risk register]]. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.

==Principles==

===Moment of risk and state of activity===

[[File:EventChainDiagramForOneActivity.png|thumb|355px|Event chain diagram for one activity]]Activities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using [[statistical distribution]]. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.

===Event chains===

Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. 
For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.

Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a "sender", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called "receiver" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.

===Event chain diagrams===
[[File:EventChainDiagramExample1.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts]]
[[Event chain diagram]] is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.&lt;ref&gt;Virine, Lev &amp; McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Virine, Lev &amp; Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:

*Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts.  
*Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. 
*Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark).
*Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
*Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. 
*Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability.
*Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events.
*Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
*Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.
By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

[[File:EventChainDiagramExample.png|355px|thumb|Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Goran Avlijas. (2018). Examining the Value of Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Time Management. Management:Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies. 10.7595/management.fon.2018.0004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashyap, Heena. (2016). Risk Analysis and Estimation of Schedule Using Monte Carlo Simulation. International Journal Of Engineering And Computer Science. 10.18535/ijecs/v5i9.42&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, T. "Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.

In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.

===Critical event chains===
Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These  are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.

===Project control with event and event chains===
Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for  performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project

==Phenomena==

===Repeated activities===
[[File:RepeatedActivity.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Repeated Activity]]Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.

===Event chains and risk response===
[[File:MitigationPlan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mitigation plan]]If an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. 
Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.

===Resource allocation based on events===
One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation 
of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

* [[George Washington]] – [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] where he warned of the dangers of [[Political party|political parties]] and [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|foreign alliances]].

*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] – [[Eisenhower's farewell address]] where he warned of the [[military–industrial complex]].
*[[Barack Obama]] – [[Barack Obama's farewell address|Obama's farewell address]] made from Chicago, breaking tradition of holding one in the White House.

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

=== Geohazards in Earth's history ===
Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

He was previously a successful high school football coach at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he coached [[Michael Oher]] and [[Greg Hardy]]. He would later follow both of them to the University of Mississippi.

==Early life==
Freeze attended [[Senatobia Municipal School District|Senatobia High School]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], from which he graduated in 1992 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] and a minor in coaching and [[sports administration]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=204944063 Hugh Freeze Bio], Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Briarcrest Christian School===
In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as the football team's [[offensive coordinator]] and [[defensive backs coach]].

While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305–63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/ncaafootball/hugh-freeze-coach-at-ole-miss-follows-an-unlikely-blueprint.html|title=Hugh Freeze, Coach at Ole Miss, Follows an Unlikely Blueprint|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his dismissal from [[Ole Miss]], some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heim|first1=Mark|title=Hugh Freeze stories emerge from former female students at Briarcrest Christian|url=https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/07/hugh_freeze_stories_emerge_fro.html|work=AL.com|date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Josh|title=Who is Hugh Freeze?

===Ole Miss===
In 2005, the [[University of Mississippi]] hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the [[tight ends coach]] and [[recruiting coordinator]], positions he held through 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|that season]], he replaced head coach [[Ed Orgeron]] on an interim basis before the hiring of [[Houston Nutt]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/13665882.html |title=Nutt Has Long List for New OC |date=January 9, 2008 |work=WTOK.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that eventually went to [[Kent Austin]].

===Lambuth===
In January 2008, [[Lambuth University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambutheagles.com/article/252.php Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach], Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he led Lambuth to an 8–4 record and a first round loss in the NAIA playoffs, marking their first appearance in the playoffs since 2004 under then head coach Vic Wallace. He was considered for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's head coaching position following the 2008 season, but remained at Lambuth University for another season and compiled a 20–5 overall record, and defeating opponents 41–17 on average. In 2009, he led the Eagles to their best regular season record in school history with an unblemished 11–0 mark. Lambuth advanced to the second round of the NAIA playoffs for first time in 11&amp;nbsp;years—having won one game before suffering elimination to finish 12–1 as the sixth-ranked team in the NAIA.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Arkansas State===
In 2010, he joined the staff at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] as offensive coordinator after a brief stint as offensive coordinator at [[San Jose State University]] under [[Mike MacIntyre]]. The Red Wolves finished with a 4–8 record, but their offensive rankings jumped from 95th in total offense and 90th in scoring offense in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] to 43rd and 46th, respectively. The Red Wolves' offense broke nine school records including total plays (856), first downs (262), pass attempts (438), pass completions (266), completion percentage (.607), passing yards (3,057), passing yards per game (254.8), and passing touchdowns (23). The Red Wolves' offense averaged 403.4 yards per game, eclipsing over 300 yards all 12 times it took the field for the first time in the history of the program. A-State posted at least 400 yards of total offense in seven games during the 2010 campaign, the most ever as an NCAA FBS member, all in his first year as offensive coordinator. After [[2010 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|the season]], Freeze was promoted to replace head coach [[Steve Roberts (American football)|Steve Roberts]].&lt;ref name=hired&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5875374&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines Hugh Freeze hired at Arkansas St.], ESPN, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his only season as head coach at Arkansas State, he led the Red Wolves to a 10–2 record and their first Sun Belt Conference title since 2005. The Red Wolves' offense averaged 447.8 ypg (28th nationally, 1st in Sun Belt Conference) including 293.6 ypg passing and 154.2 ypg rushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109125126/http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze left Arkansas State before the Arkansas State's appearance in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]] following the season.

===Ole Miss===
On December 5, 2011, Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the University of Mississippi. During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to "retire at Ole Miss." He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FreezeOMHire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugh Freeze is Rebels' new coach |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7319777/hugh-freeze-mississippi-rebels-emotional-accepting-coaching-job |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6–6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41–24 victory over Mississippi State in the [[Egg Bowl]]. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38–17 to finish 7–6.

Freeze received national attention on [[National Signing Day]] 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings?class=2013 |title=2013 Football Class Rankings |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org/2014/01/13/hugh-freeze-named-grant-teaff-coach-of-the-year/ |title=Hugh Freeze named coach of the year by Fellowship of Christian Athletes |work=FCA.org |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7–0 start, the program's best start since the [[Johnny Vaught]] era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]]–their first major bowl appearance since the [[1970 Sugar Bowl]], and easily the biggest bowl they had attended since Vaught's tenure.

On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43–37, in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], making Freeze only the third head coach, along with [[Les Miles]] and [[Steve Spurrier]], to defeat a [[Nick Saban]]-coached team in back-to-back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96–'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to #3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the [[2016 Sugar Bowl]], where they won 48–20 over [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]]. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll—their first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969.

In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous "impermissible benefits" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/2/22/14703296/ole-miss-ncaa-allegations-list-2017|title=The updated list of 21 NCAA allegations against Ole Miss football|author=Morgan Moriarty|publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laremy Tunsil says he took money from coach at Ole Miss |work=ESPN |date=April 28, 2016 |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15424437/2016-nfl-draft-laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-cash-ole-miss-rebels-coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017—three months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived—Ole Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations/&gt;

On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, [[Houston Nutt]], sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request for calls Freeze made on his university-issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-bc-fbc--mississippi-freezes-downfall-20170721-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female [[escort service]], and alerted Ole Miss officials about it.  Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2017/07/20/ole-miss-coach-hugh-freeze-called-number-tied-escort-service/498056001/|title=Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze made call to number tied to escort service|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as "a concerning pattern" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor [[Jeff Vitter]] and athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the [[morals clause]] of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator [[Matt Luke (American football)|Matt Luke]] was named interim coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited |title=Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze resigns; escort-service calls cited |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |author-link=Mark Schlabach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona Hotshots (AAF)===
On October 11, 2018, Freeze was named as the Offensive Coordinator for the [[Arizona Hotshots]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]].

[[File:JENNY LIND HUMBUG.jpg|thumb|An 1850 cartoon of [[Jenny Lind]] outside [[P. T. Barnum]]'s New American Museum, New York City, 1850, captioned as a "Panorama of Humbug"]]
[[File:Magic vs Science.jpg|thumb|''Humbugging, or raising the Devil'', 1800. [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]’s humbugging depicts the public as a credulous simpleton being distracted by a display of “the miraculous”, the better to have his pockets picked.]]
A '''humbug''' is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a [[hoax]] or in jest.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humbug|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/humbug|publisher=Collin's Dictionary|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first described in 1751 as student [[slang]], and recorded in 1840 as a "nautical phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Years Before the Mast | author=Dana, Richard Henry Jr. | authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. | year=1840|quote=When there is danger or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work faster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing, or, as the nautical phrase is, 'humbugged,' no sloth could make less headway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also often used as an exclamation to mean [[nonsense]] or [[gibberish]].

When referring to a person, a humbug means a [[fraud]] or [[impostor]], implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], created by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. His famous reference to [[Christmas]], '''"Bah! Humbug!"''', declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and television versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees.

Another use of the word was by [[John Collins Warren]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor who worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of [[ether]] anesthesia, administered by [[William Thomas Green Morton]], a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=William |title=The Genealogy of Mass General |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/genealogy-mass-general?page=5 |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=35 |issue=6 |year=1984 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book ''The Student'' (1750–1751), ii. 41, where it is called "a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's ''The Universal Jester'', subtitled "a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs" from 1754; as mentioned in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from 1911, which further refers to the ''New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Humbug |volume=13 |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven:
* [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''hum'', meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word ''bugges'' (used in the Bible), a variant of ''bogey'', meaning 'apparitions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling'' [1891], Chapter X [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gsft/gsft12.htm of ''The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse word ''hum'' mentioned, or ''hume'', actually means 'dark air' in [[Old Norwegian]]. From the other [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] based on Old Norse, there is ''húm'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which means 'twilight', ''hómi'' in [[Faeroese language|Faeroese]] which means 'unclear', and ''humi'' in Old [[Swedish language|Swedish]] which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hum|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this word is also derived the Swedish verb ''hymla'', still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hymla|title='Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hymla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' by [[Francis Grose]], 1731–1791, ''to hum'' in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with ''bugges'' from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word ''bug'' is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Bugge'' (of which the term ''[[Bogeyman|bogey]]'' is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word ''bögge'' (of which ''böggel-mann'' (''"Goblin"'') is derived)&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle English Dictionary'' by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, University of Michigan Press, 1958, {{ISBN|978-0-472-01025-7}}, page 1212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary'', 11th edition, Merriam-Webster, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-809-5}}, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Norwegian dialect word ''bugge'' meaning "important man".&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'', Merriam-Webster, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-603-9}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh ''bwg'' (''"ghost"'') could also be connected,&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bug |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought in the past to be the origin of the English term however more recent studies indicate that it is a borrowing from the much older Middle English word.&lt;ref&gt;''Metatony in Baltic, Volume 6 of Leiden studies in Indo-European'' by Rick Derksen, Rodopi, 1996, {{ISBN|90-5183-990-1}}, {{ISBN|978-90-5183-990-6}}, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog   : English bogey from a Slavonic root?'', Brian Cooper 1, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Correspondence to Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Northern English Lexis: A Literary Corpus-Based Study'', Javier Ruano-Garcia, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3-0343-0058-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-0343-0058-2}}. pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in folk life'', John Geraint Jenkins, Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate, Ayer Publishing, 1977,{{ISBN|0-405-10102-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10102-1}}. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with ''bug'' meaning ghost or goblin, the use of the term applies in Dickens' novel about the Christmas ghosts. In ''Etym. Diet.'' of 1898, [[Walter Skeat]] also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where ''hum'' meant to murmur applause, and ''bug'' being a spectre.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* It could also come from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''uomo bugiardo'', which literally means 'lying man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/dictionary/brewers/humbug.html |title=Factmonster |publisher=Factmonster |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug').
* ''Uim-bog'' is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in [[Irish language|Irish]], worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' also suggests that it is a form of "[[Hamburg]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print.
* A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug—''i.e.'' something small and inconsequential, such as a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], that makes a lot of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/012504.html#humbug |title=word-detective |publisher=word-detective |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything.

The word has been used outside of anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horst Conrad |url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-ismen_.html |title=etymologie.info |publisher=Etymologie.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden since at least 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=humbug|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v.

On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the [[US-Mexico border|Mexico–United States border]], while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks.
The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston|first=Julia|date=30 June 2014|title=Texas: Panel Rules Agent Can Be Sued Over Shooting Teenager Across Border|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/texas-panel-rules-agent-can-be-sued-over-shooting-teenager-across-border.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2014|title=Court: Mexican family can sue over fatal Border Patrol shooting|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/07/01/court-mexican-family-can-sue-over-fatal-border-patrol-shooting/|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2014|title=Mexican teenager killed by US Border Patrol agents had rights, court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/mexican-teenager-killed-us-border-patrol-agents-constitution|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|date=9 Jun 2014|title=After Shootings, Extended Silence: What The Border Patrol Hasn't Said|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/09/320220093/foi-request-sheds-some-light-on-border-patrol-shootings|newspaper=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2017 |title=Supreme Court seems split over Mexican teen's shooting death by Border Patrol agent|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-seems-split-in-case-of-boys-death-near-us-mexico-border/|newspaper=[[CBS]]|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games &amp; Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures
* [[Snaps (game)]]: A game in which a player spells out a name using finger snapping and verbal cues.  Featured in [[P.S. I Love You (film)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snaps|title=How to Play Snaps.|publisher=WikiHow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers. However, a playable version has been created by fans, based on the rules and play that are presented in the books.

===Hoax games===
* [[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|Numberwang]]: A recurring "game show" on the sketch series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|That Mitchell and Webb Look]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC - Numberwang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Mornington Crescent'' above, the "contestants" call out random numbers in an attempt to score a "Numberwang", though the responses are scripted and there are no actual rules to winning a "Numberwang".
* Clique: The online satirical gaming magazine ''Critical Miss'' featured rules for a card game called Clique, a parody of collectible card games that used printed cards and spurious spoken rules to confuse onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue9/clique1.html|title=Clique: The Uncollectable, Unplayable Card Game|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of games in Star Trek#Fizzbin|Fizzbin]]: In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "A Piece of the Action", [[James T. Kirk]] created this game while he and [[Spock (Star Trek)|Cmdr. Spock]] were being held prisoner. They "taught" the game to the guards, improvising the rules until their captors were sufficiently distracted, then overpowered them and escaped.

{{Campaignbox Pakistan–United States skirmishes}}
On 21 September 2008 at 10 pm local time, in the [[Ghulam Khan]] district of [[North Waziristan]] Pakistani soldiers fired on two American helicopter gunships that entered Pakistani airspace with 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm [[heavy machine gun]]s. The helicopters stopped and hovered for a while, before returning over the border to Afghanistan without retaliation. It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] – ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called?

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

Tyson grew up in the [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]] neighborhood of the Bronx, and later in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]].&lt;ref name="ndtking2"&gt;[http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/neil-degrasse-tyson-climate-change-afterlife-elon-musk-0_3wnw5ixmufx0 Larry King Now: Neil deGrasse Tyson on Climate Change, the Afterlife, and Elon Musk]. Ora.tv. Retrieved June 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; From kindergarten throughout high school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: P.S. 36, P.S. 81, the [[Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy]] (then called "P.S. 141"), and [[The Bronx High School of Science]] (1972–1976) where he was captain of the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] team and editor-in-chief of the ''Physical Science Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[SiriusXM]] |date=March 6, 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZiemfCkr0#t=41m55s |title=Opie &amp; Anthony: Neil deGrasse Tyson Neil deGrasse Tyson ft.

He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer &amp; Shepherd-Wynn 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 15, 2013 |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Prodigy Astronomer |url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182841/http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |accessdate=May 27, 2013 |archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=Whitaker2000 /&gt; In his book, ''The Sky Is Not the Limit'', Tyson wrote:

{{quote|My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention.

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson chose to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he majored in physics and lived in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]. He was a member of the [[Sport rowing|crew]] team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, [[Letterman (sports)|lettering]] in his senior year.

Tyson earned an [[Artium Baccalaureus|AB]] degree in physics at [[Harvard College]] in 1980 and then began his graduate work at the [[University of Texas at Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/02/star-power/ |title=Star Power |date=February 28, 2012 |work=The Alcalde|access-date=August 30, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in astronomy in 1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to consider alternate careers and the committee for his doctoral dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from the University of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cahalan |first=Rose |date=February 28, 2012 |title=Star Power |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/02/star-power |publisher=[[The Alcalde]] |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity.

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‘Tokyo bureau’ refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‘Washington bureau’ is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won’t Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

[[File:RidersOfJudgment.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

The '''Rio Nuñez incident''' or '''Rio Nuñez affair''' was an [[international incident]] which occurred on the [[Nunez river|Rio Nuñez]] near [[Boké]], in modern-day [[Guinea]], in 1849. The incident occurred when vessels of a joint [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[French Second Empire|French]] naval force fired on two [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] traders in the area. 

During the 1840s and 50s, [[West Africa]] was the site of fledgling colonial rivalry between European powers. The Nuñez region lay between the [[French conquest of Senegal|French colony of Senegal]] and [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. French traders were increasingly challenged by commercial trading expeditions from Britain, Belgium and America.

The French regional commander, [[Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez|Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]], hoped that the Nuñez region could be formally annexed as a protectorate of the [[French colonial empire]]. The attack, far from securing the region for France, went contrary to Bouët-Willaumez's plans. Both France and Belgium led a [[cover-up]]. Attempts by the British Prime Minister, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]], to force France to pay reparations for the incident were ultimately unsuccessful and the affair lasted four years.

The incident formed part of the "Prelude to the [[Scramble for Africa]]" and, as Bouët-Willaumez had hoped, did lead to increased French control of the Nuñez. In 1866, French forces occupied Boké. The affair was therefore one of the first signs of future French hegemony in West Africa in what would become [[French West Africa]] (AOF).

{{Distinguish|The Sound of Music Live!}}
'''''The Sound of Music Live''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 20 December 2015. The special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', starring [[Kara Tointon]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[3 Mills Studios]] in London. 

On 9 November 2018, the production was broadcast in the United States as part of [[PBS]]'s performing arts anthology series ''[[Great Performances]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/great-performances-imports-uk-s-sound-of-music/article_f1a6feb2-4b7f-57f9-9a41-e05aa84a76de.html|title='Great Performances' imports UK's 'Sound of Music'|work=UnionLeader.com|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
In October 2015, ITV announced that it would transmit a live adaptation of the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as part of its holiday programming lineup, in what would be the first time that such a programme had been attempted in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV To Mount ‘The Sound Of Music Live!’ UK Christmas Special|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/itv-sound-of-music-live-christmas-special-kara-tointon-1201590814/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live'' was part of ITV's continuing efforts to broadcast more live "[[Event television|event]]" programs, which are designed to attract critical masses of viewers by encouraging them to watch via the original broadcast, rather than via [[video on demand|catch-up]] services and [[digital video recorder]]s. The desire for increased ITV viewership came especially in the wake of declining ratings for its reality music competition ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', whose [[The X Factor (UK series 12)|series 12]] finale had the second-smallest viewership in the programme's history. ITV had similarly broadcast live episodes of its series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in [[Coronation Street Live (2000 episode)|2000]] and [[Coronation Street Live (2010 episode)|2010]] in honour of its 40th and 50th anniversary respectively, and in 2015 for ITV's 60th anniversary.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"/&gt;

This was not the first time that ''The Sound of Music'' had been adapted in such a manner. In 2013, U.S. network [[NBC]] broadcast its own [[The Sound of Music Live!|live television adaptation of ''The Sound of Music'']] starring [[country music|country]] singer [[Carrie Underwood]]; similarly to ITV's version, it was an adaptation of the original musical, and not based on the [[The Sound of Music|film version]]. Although it received mixed reviews, it was seen by over 18 million viewers. As follow-ups, NBC produced similar adaptations of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]'' in 2014 and 2015 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-wiz-live-nbc-s-latest-live-musical-broadcast-from-long-island-1.11164689|title=‘The Wiz Live!’: NBC’s latest live musical broadcast from Long Island|last1=Crook|first1=John|date=26 November 2015|website=newsday.com |publisher=Newsday|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-ratings-nbc/ |title=Ratings: NBC's Sound of Music Live!

==Cast==
[[Kara Tointon]] played Maria, and [[Julian Ovenden]] played Captain Georg von Trapp. The supporting cast included veterans of British television and theatre, including [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Max Detweiler, [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] as Baroness Elsa Schraeder, [[Maria Friedman]] as Mother Abess, [[Evelyn Hoskins]] as Liesl von Trapp, Jon Tarcy as Rolf Gruber, [[Mel Giedroyc]] as the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and [[Paul Copley]] as the butler, Franz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live!|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dwnsbw/the-sound-of-music-live|website=Radio Times|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Sound of Music Live'' received mixed reviews. Mark Shenton of ''[[The Stage]]'' said it was a failed experiment, with "uninspired and sometimes insipid" choreography and direction, although he praised the cast's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenton|first1=Mark|title=The Sound of Music Live review – ‘bold experiment doesn’t pay off’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-sound-of-music-live-review-bold-experiment-doesnt-pay-off/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Allfree of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said it lacked both the intimacy of live theatre and the scope of the big screen, but nevertheless judged it "more a success than it was a failure," saying that former ''[[EastEnders]]'' star Tointon "brought a refreshing earthiness and grit to Maria that made the passionate, unconventional novice feel thoroughly modern and accessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live, review: 'much to enjoy'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/12056862/the-sound-of-music-review-kara-tointon-live-itv.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said that Tointon was "showered with praise" for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kara Tointon shocks fans with incredible vocals as she plays Maria in The Sound Of Music live|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kara-tointon-shocks-fans-incredible-7048037|website=The Mirror|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was watched by over 3.82 million viewers according to overnight ratings figures, being beaten by the [[The Apprentice (UK series eleven)|series eleven]] finale of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' (5.31 million) and its lead-in, the [[2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] presentation (5.78 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-apprentice/news/a777848/uk-tv-ratings-the-apprentice-final-loses-800000-from-last-year-sports-personality-is-top-with-57m/ |title=UK TV ratings: The Apprentice final is lowest in 10 years, Sports Personality is top with 5.7m |author=Tom Eames |work=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV's The Sound of Music Live draws 4m viewers|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/itvs-the-sound-of-music-live-draws-4m-viewers/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

Randy Phillips, the CEO of [[AEG Live]], told The LA Times that Australia was part of Michael Jackson's international tour plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |title=Michael Jackson Planning Australian Tour Before His Death |publisher=Take 40 |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504000236/http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |archivedate=May 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous film and album==
{{Further|Michael Jackson's This Is It|Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)}}

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.  Some of the music and vocals in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="This Is It Worldwide Release Dates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |title=This Is It Worldwide Release Dates |work=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures.com]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214515/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accompanying album to the film was also released. Titled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|This Is It]]'', the compilation was distributed internationally on October 26, and to North America the following day. The two-disc album features music "inspired from the documentary of the same name".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/09/the-michael-jackson-new-musical-onslaught-begins.html |author=Chris Lee |title=The Michael Jackson new-music onslaught begins [Updated] |work=[[The LA Times|TheLATimes.com]] |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the album, Sony said, "Disc one will feature the original album masters of some of Michael's biggest hits arranged in the same sequence as they appear in the film" and stated that "the disc ends with two versions of the 'never-released' '[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]' [...] This song is featured in the film's closing sequence and includes backing vocals by Michael's brothers, [[The Jacksons]] and Alvin Chea of Take 6."&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a178845/new-jackson-single-lp-to-be-released.html?imdb |title=New Jackson single, LP to be released |author=Tim Parks |date=September 23, 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy|Digital Spy.com]] |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony added that the second disc will feature previously unreleased versions from Jackson's "catalogue of hits", along with a spoken word [[poem]] entitled "Planet Earth" and a 36-page commemorative booklet with "exclusive photos of Michael from his last rehearsal".&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theinsidersonginfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/2870440_Unreleased_Michael_Jackson_Song_to_be_Revealed|author=The Insider Staff |work=[[The Insider (TV series)|TheInsider.com]] |title=Unreleased Michael Jackson Song to be Revealed |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Soar''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fashion designer]], [[graphic designer]], [[event planner]] and [[DJ]].

==Career==
Soar began his creative career working with designer [[Neville Brody]] on an interiors project POST Design.  This was followed by independent practice as a graphic designer, and then in the design company STAC collaborating with photographer [[Andrew Catlin]]. His work was focussed in music, producing artwork for numerous international record sleeves, publications and campaigns.

==Career as a DJ==
While working with Neville Brody, Soar became involved in the music industry and began working as a DJ. Soar had residencies at a number of venues and clubs across London. He was also involved in the writing and arrangement of [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s song ''Just Like Everybody''. He was also part of the band called Toll, which released the album ''Christ Knows'' in 2006.

==Design label==
In 2005, Soar launched the Tim Soar design label and this was described as “really well-made menswear that mixes minimalism, sportswear, tailoring, and unusual fabrications.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=1162|title=London Fashion Week - Tim Soar|website=londonfashionweek.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Soar described his foray from music to fashion design with these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt that I had something to say about modern menswear and that it was time to move on from the flippant to something more serious. I was tired of seeing gimmicky menswear that was badly made and did not fit correctly. I set out to produce clothes that are a synthesis of minimalism and the avant garde made to the highest possible standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/soar|title=Soar {{!}} NOT JUST A LABEL|website=www.notjustalabel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first collection was presented by the London-based B-Store, the second collection by [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]], and has continued with packed shows at each [[London Fashion Week]] since Spring/Summer 09. His women's wear line debuted in 2011 with a capsule collection for Browns 24. Soar told [[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]] that the concept is womenswear for boyish women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/tim-soar-launches-womenswear|title=Girls Who Like Boys|last=Alexander|first=Ella|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soar's collections are now available in numerous countries worldwide.

==Music Concrete==
Soar is also creative head of Music Concrete, a music consultancy that was established in 1987. It initially catered to the boutique hotel market but has since expanded into launches, fashion, and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicconcrete.com/about-music-consultancy/|title=Music Concrete: Music consultant for hotels, spas and bars|website=musicconcrete.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked with many of the leading UK and international fashion designers and design houses, including [[Donna Karen]] [[Prada]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Levi's]], [[Fendi]], [[LVMH]], Mathew Williamson, Fendi and Adidas. Through Music Concrete, Soar also collaborated with luxury hotels groups including Schrager Hotels,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; St. Martin's Lane Hotel, Sanderson, Columbus and Great Eastern.

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.
