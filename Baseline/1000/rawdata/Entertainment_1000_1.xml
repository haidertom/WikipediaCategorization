[[Image:Vasnetsov Razvlechenie.jpg|300px|thumb|''Amusement'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

'''Amusement''', from the old French ''à muser'' – to put into a stupid stare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6786#eid4700112|title=Amuse, v.|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford English Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the state of [[experience|experiencing]] [[humour|humorous]] and [[entertainment|entertaining]] events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with [[enjoyment]], [[happiness]], [[laughter]] and [[pleasure]]. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.

Amusement is considered an "epistemological" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shiota, M. N., Keltner, D., &amp; John, O. P.|title=Positive emotion dispositions differentially associated with Big Five personality and attachment style.|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2006|volume=1|issue=2|pages=61–71|doi=10.1080/17439760500510833|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.1730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.

Current studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and sociology.  In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less 'amusing' than another, similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.

==Theories==

Two different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:

=== Evolutionary ===
The evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shiota, M. N., Campos, B., Keltner, D., &amp; Hertenstein, M. J.|title=Positive emotion and the regulation of interpersonal relationships in The Regulation of Emotion|date=2004|publisher=Philippot, P. &amp; Feldman, R. S. Eds. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=127–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latta, R. L.|title=The basic humor process: A cognitive-shift theory and the case against incongruity.|date=1999|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coser|first1=Rose Laub|title=Some Social Functions of Laughter|journal=Human Relations|date=1 April 2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=171–182|doi=10.1177/001872675901200205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructed emotion ===
The [[theory of constructed emotion]] suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=Solving the emotion paradox: Categorization and the experience of emotion|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=20–46|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_2|pmid=16430327|citeseerx=10.1.1.577.4057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|pmid=27798257|pmc=5390700|year=2017|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotional expression of amusement ==
The origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner, D., Tracy, J. L., Sauter, D. A., Cordaro, D. C. &amp; McNeil, G.|title=Expression of Emotion.| journal=In Barrett, L. F., Lewis, M. &amp; Haviland-Jones, J. M. Eds., Handbook of Emotions|date=2016|volume=4th|pages=467–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, Darwin published his book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals|orig-year=1872|year=1998|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, [[Paul Ekman]], an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman|first1=Paul|title=The argument and evidence about universals in facial expressions|journal=Handbook of Social Psychophysiology|date=1989|pages=143–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work focused on six basic emotions: [[happiness]], [[anger]], [[sadness]], [[fear]], [[disgust]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman, P., Sorenson, E. R., &amp; Friesen, W. V.|title=Pan-cultural elements in facial displays of emotion|journal=Science|date=1969|volume=164|issue=3875|pages=86–88|doi=10.1126/science.164.3875.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekman, P., &amp; Rosenberg, E. L. (Eds.).|title=What the face reveals: Basic and applied studies of spontaneous expression using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Displays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner|first1=Dacher|title=Signs of appeasement: Evidence for the distinct displays of embarrassment, amusement, and shame|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=68|issue=3|pages=441–454|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.441|citeseerx=10.1.1.420.9278}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon-Thomas, E. R., Keltner, D. J., Sauter, D., Sinicropi-Yao, L., &amp; Abramson, A.|title=The voice conveys specific emotions: evidence from vocal burst displays|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9 |issue=6|pages=838–846|doi=10.1037/a0017810|pmid=20001126|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laukka, P., Elfenbein, H. A., Söder, N., Nordström, H., Althoff, J., Chui, W., ... &amp; Thingujam, N. S.|title=Cross-cultural decoding of positive and negative non-linguistic emotion vocalizations.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2013|volume=4|pages=353|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00353|pmid=23914178|pmc=3728469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauter, D.

[[File:Ron Killings &amp; Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|Professional wrestlers [[Vince McMahon]] (right) and [[Ron Killings]] (left) showing amused facial expressions]]

=== Facial expression ===
An amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Intelligence Quiz|url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/take_quiz/ei_quiz|website=Greater Good Science Center|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Head: Thrown back with jaw lifted
*Eyes: Crow's feet at the eyes indicating that the muscles have tightened
*Mouth: Open, jaw dropped with relaxed muscles

=== Vocal burst ===
The expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural considerations ==

As a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Jeanne L.|title=Ideal affect: Cultural causes and behavioral consequences.|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|pmid=26151968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical uses==
=== Emotion regulation ===

Emotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=James J.|title=The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=271–299|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.7042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giuliani, N. R., McRae, K., &amp; Gross, J. J.|title=The up-and down-regulation of amusement: experiential, behavioral, and autonomic consequences|journal=Emotion|date=2008|volume=8|issue=5|pages=714–719|doi=10.1037/a0013236|pmid=18837622|pmc=4138973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugade, M. M., &amp; Fredrickson, B. L.|title=Regulation of positive emotions: Emotion regulation strategies that promote resilience|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=2007|volume=8|issue=3|pages=311–333|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience ===

As a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bai, S., &amp; Repetti, R. L.|title=Short‐term resilience processes in the family.|journal=Family Relations|date=2015|volume=64|issue=1|pages=108–119|doi=10.1111/fare.12101|pmid=26246651|pmc=4523303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson, B. L., Tugade, M. M., Waugh, C. E., &amp; Larkin, G. R.|title=What good are positive emotions in crisis? A prospective study of resilience and emotions following the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11th, 2001|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=84|issue=2|pages=365–376|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.365|pmid=12585810|pmc=2755263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotions help people build social resources that foster their ability to cope during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugade, M. M., Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Feldman Barrett, L. (2004).|title=Psychological resilience and positive emotional granularity: Examining the benefits of positive emotions on coping and health.|journal=Journal of Personality|date=2004|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1161–1190|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00294.x|pmid=15509280|pmc=1201429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in resilience lead to higher [[life satisfaction]] and general happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Michael A.|last2=Fredrickson|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Brown|first3=Stephanie L.|last4=Mikels|first4=Joseph A.|last5=Conway|first5=Anne M.|date=2009|title=Happiness Unpacked: Positive Emotions Increase Life Satisfaction by Building Resilience|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)|volume=9|issue=3|pages=361–368|doi=10.1037/a0015952|issn=1528-3542|pmc=3126102|pmid=19485613}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Laughter Yoga.jpg|thumb|People engaging in laughter therapy]]

=== Laughter therapy ===

Rapidly growing in popularity, [[laughter]] therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burbank|first1=Luke|title=The Growing Popularity of Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5165226|website=NPR.org|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the bodies' muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/|website=Cancer Treatment Centers of America|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed benefits include: Stress management,&lt;ref name="MayoClinicLaughter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Stress relief from laughter? It's no joke|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456|website=www.mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckelkamp|first1=Stephanie|title=Laughter Therapy is the New Meditation|url=http://time.com/84987/laughter-may-be-the-new-meditation/|website=Time.com|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin, R. A.|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=504–519|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7364">An '''article''' is a [[written work]] published in a [[Publishing|print]] or [[electronic media|electronic]] medium. It may be for the purpose of propagating news, research results, academic analysis, or debate.

==News articles==
{{See also|News style}}
A '''news article''' discusses current or recent news of either general interest (i.e. daily [[newspaper]]s) or of a specific topic (i.e. political or trade news [[magazine]]s, club newsletters, or technology news websites).

A news article can include accounts of eyewitnesses to the happening event. It can contain photographs, accounts, statistics, graphs, recollections, interviews, polls, debates on the topic, etc. Headlines can be used to focus the reader’s attention on a particular (or main) part of the article. The writer can also give facts and detailed information following answers to general questions like [[Five Ws|who, what, when, where, why and how]].

Quoted references can also be helpful. References to people can also be made through the written accounts of interviews and debates confirming the factuality of the writer’s information and the reliability of his source. The writer can use redirection to ensure that the reader keeps reading the article and to draw her attention to other articles. For example, phrases like "Continued on page 3” redirect the reader to a page where the article is continued.

While a good conclusion is an important ingredient for newspaper articles, the immediacy of a deadline environment means that [[copy editing]] often takes the form of deleting everything past an arbitrary point in the story corresponding to the dictates of available space on a page. Therefore, newspaper reporters are trained to write in [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] style, with all the most important information in the first paragraph or two. If the less vital details are pushed towards the end of the story, then the potentially destructive impact of draconian copy editing will be minimized.

===Elements of a news article===

====Headline====
A '''[[headline]]''' is text above a newspaper article, indicating its topic. The headline catches the attention of the reader and relates well to the topic. Modern headlines are typically written in an abbreviated style omitting many elements of a complete sentence and almost always including a non-copular verb.

====Byline====
A '''[[byline]]''' gives the name and often the position of the writer, along with the date.

====Lead====
The [[Lead paragraph|lead]] (sometimes spelled ''lede'') [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] captures the attention of the reader and sums up the focus of the story. The lead also establishes the subject, sets the tone and guides reader into the article.&lt;ref name="jaco"&gt;Jacobi, Peter, ''The Magazine Article: How to Think It, Plan It, Write It.'' Writer's Digest Books: 1991, {{ISBN|0-89879-450-1}}, pp. 50-77, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news story, the introductory paragraph includes the most important facts and answers the questions: ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'' and'' how''. In a featured story, the author may choose to open in any number of ways, often using a [[narrative hook]], possibly one of the following:&lt;ref name="polk"&gt;Polking, Kirk, ''Writing A to Z.'' Writer's Digest Books: 1990. {{ISBN|0-89879-556-7}}, pp. 136, 143, 224, 422, 497&lt;/ref&gt;
an [[anecdote]], a shocking or [[startle|startling]] statement, a [[generalization]], pure [[information]], a [[description]], a [[Quotation|quote]], a [[question]] or a comparison.
 
====Body or running text====
For the news story, details and elaboration are evident in the body or running text of the news story and flow smoothly from the lead. Quotes are used to add interest and support to the story. Most news stories are structured using what is called an inverted pyramid. The ''angle'' (also called a ''hook'' or ''peg'') is usually the most newsworthy aspect of the story and is specifically highlighted and elaborated upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/glossary.html|title=The News Manual - Glossary|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A featured article will follow a format appropriate for its type. Structures for featured articles may include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref name="jaco" /&gt;
* ''chronological'', where the article may be a narrative of some sort;
* ''cause and effect'', where the reasons and results of an event or process are examined;
* ''classification'', where items in an article are grouped to help aid understanding;
* ''compare and contrast'', where two or more items are examined side-by-side to show similarities and differences;
* ''list'', a simple item-by-item run-down of pieces of information;
* ''question and answer'', such as an interview with a celebrity or reybel
 
====Conclusion====
The conclusion will sum up the article, possibly including a final quote, a descriptive scene, a play on the title or lead, a summary statement, or the writer's opinion. Make the conclusion attention-grabbing.

===Characteristics of well-written news articles===
The article is usually on a well-defined topic or topics that are related in some way, such as a factual account of a newsworthy event.
The writer of a well-written article is seen as objective and showing all sides to an issue.
The sources for a news story should be identified and reliable.
The technique of [[show, don't tell]] is applied.

===Authorship===
Publications obtain articles in a few different ways:
* '''staff written''' &amp;ndash; an article may be written by a person on the staff of the publication.
* '''assigned''' &amp;ndash; a [[Freelancer|freelance]] writer may be asked to write an article on a specific topic.

'''''The Bad News Bears''''' is an American [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[multi-media]] franchise created by screenwriter [[Bill Lancaster]]. It began in 1976 with ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'', and was followed by two sequels and a remake: ''[[The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training]]'' (1977), ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' (1978) and ''[[Bad News Bears]]'' (2005).

While the first film garnered critical acclaim, critics were less enthusiastic about its sequels. Furthermore, the series has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and [[teen film]] narratives in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bruce David|last2=Mahan|first2=Jeffrey H.|title=Religion and Popular Culture in America|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=[[Oakland, California]]|isbn=0520246896|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaRJ2KkXSBQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31 31]|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Catherine|title=Teen Film: A Critical Introduction|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=1847886868|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CB4NOZ2_NGQC&amp;pg=PT136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle Dome''''' was a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] American television series that aired from September 1999 to April 2001. It combined elements of ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' – inspired athletic competition with scripted antics more reminiscent of [[professional wrestling]]. Recurring character-athletes known as "Warriors" competed against weekly contestants in a variety of physically demanding (and sometimes dangerous) events.  The series was filmed at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]].

The entire first and second season of ''Battle Dome'' is available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon Video]].

==Overview==
A Warrior typically entered the show's arena accompanied by his own bombastic theme music and-in several cases-a comely female sidekick; in later episodes, weekly contestants were also allotted female companions, courtesy of ''[[Perfect 10 (magazine)|Perfect 10]]'' magazine.

The announcer for the show was [[Steve Albert]] (brother of [[Marv Albert|Marv]] and the uncle of [[Kenny Albert|Kenny]]); [[Scott Ferrall]] provided [[color commentary]]. [[Seth Stockton]] served as referee for the entire run. [[Downtown Julie Brown]] appeared in early episodes, as a sideline correspondent but was replaced by [[Kathleen McClellan]] for the run of the show. The "Chairman", whose [[List of unseen characters|face remained off camera]], oversaw the proceedings. Halfway through the show's run, Ferrall and Brown were replaced by [[Ed Lover]] and [[Brien Blakely]], respectively, and "The chairman" was dropped from the show.

''Battle Dome'' was also broadcast in the UK, on the [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] and [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] networks, as well as on Channel 5, now "Five." It was also broadcast in Ireland on [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]].

Three male contestants competed in a series of four or five events, which varied in intensity and danger factor. After the fourth or fifth event, the two highest scoring competitors advanced to the Battle Dome final. In addition to facing the contestants, the Battle Dome Warriors were in a show-long competition against each other for the Battle Dome Warriors Championship belt. The Warriors were ranked before the competition started and could move up or down the list depending on either how well they performed during the show or how well they politicked with the chairman or his on-camera assistant, Bobbie Haven (played by model [[Bobbie Brown]], who prior to this was best known for her appearance in the video for [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]").

If the second and third place players were tied, the tie was broken in a rather novel way. Both players would stand on platforms on two separate metal discs, with the discs being pulled back and rammed together at high rates of speed. The intensity of the hit grew until one player fell off, at which point they would be going home. This also would help determine the Warriors champion if the championship was in question at the end of a show.

After all ties and championships between the Warriors and contestants were settled, the two remaining players moved into the Battle Dome for the final round, in which the two competitors wrestled each other in an attempt to throw the opponent off an elevated platform. Doing so won the match, a cash prize, and a Battle Dome championship ring. The winner would also advance in the Battle Dome tournament, with the winner getting a large cash prize, a motorcycle, and a [[Battle Dome Championship]] belt at the end of the season.

===Second season changes===
*The Battle Dome Warriors Championship and Warrior Championship Belt were removed.
*In addition to the male competitors, season two added a female special where five women competed against each other with the warriors acting as "Coaches".
*The Battle Dome Cage event changed significantly. Wrestling was no longer permitted with the emphasis put much more onto martial arts style fighting, in particular kickboxing. The aim was to remove your opponent from the platform. if both men fell, the battle would restart. this final event had no time limit.
*Most of the Battle Dome Warriors' valets (among those who had them) were replaced by the ''Perfect 10'' models that the contestants were accompanied by. With the exception of T-Money, who kept "The Possee".

===World Championship Wrestling===
In fall of 2000, the stars of ''Battle Dome'' and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) began a brief cross-promotional [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]]. It kicked off when WCW wrestlers disrupted a ''Battle Dome'' taping. In retaliation, on the November 6 edition of ''[[Monday Nitro]]'', [[Terry Crews|T-Money]], Cuda, [[Michael O'Hearn|Mike O'Dell]] (husband of WCW star [[Melinda O'Hearn|Midajah]]), [[Chad Bannon|D.O.A.]], and Bubba King began heckling in the audience as [[Diamond Dallas Page]] spoke to the Chicago crowd. [[Rick Steiner]], [[Ernest Miller]], and [[Buff Bagwell]] came to Page's aid before security ended the physical dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_7/ai_66686873 ``BATTLE DOME'' Warriors Shock ``Monday Nitro''; Live Broadcast Interrupted by Five Warriors Issuing Challenge to WCW] ''Business Wire'' (November 7, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between these men continued as far as November 20,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Nov_21/ai_67223910 ADVISORY/Photo of "Battle Dome" 'Warriors' Bubba King, Cuda, D.O.A. and T-Money is available on BW PhotoWire/AP PhotoExpress, NewsCom, PressLink and Business Wire's Web Site] ''Business Wire'' (November 21, 2000). Retrieved on 9–21–08.&lt;/ref&gt; mere months before the buyout of WCW by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).

==Events==

All events were overseen by Referee [[Seth Stockton]]. His actual level of authority is unclear although he did ban a few warriors from competing for bad behaviour.

'''Battle Wheel'''

Two warriors competed.  The event took place on a large, rotating platform which resembled a right circular [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] with its outside edge and apex flattened.  The contenders had 60 seconds to force both warriors to touch the bottom ring of the wheel with any part of their body. The warriors were allowed to do essentially anything necessary to keep this from occurring. The contenders had to dispatch of the first warrior on the lower portion of the wheel (usually Jake Fury) before taking on the warrior at the top of the wheel (usually Cuda). 25 points were earned for removing the lower warrior from the wheel, and an additional 25 points were earned for getting the 2nd warrior off the wheel.

*Jake Fury suffered a nasty ankle injury on the Battle Wheel towards the end of Season 1. Fury's ankle was "blown out" and facing the incorrect direction. He only competed sparingly on the show afterwards.
*Scott Anthony, a contestant, also had his ankle broken/twisted (similar to Jake Fury's) under virtually the same circumstances in episode four of season 1.
*In Season 2, the Battle Wheel was significantly changed as the Wheel was lowered and wider, making it difficult for a contestant to defeat a warrior and so the ankle blow-out injury never happened again.

'''Take Down'''

A football type event. The contender was placed in the center of an enclosed area with 2 warriors on each end (Michael O'Dell participated in this event most often). Behind each warrior were 4 different lights with actuators beneath them. In the 1st season, a light was lit up behind the warrior (Steve and Scott typically noted that the warriors did not know which light was lit). On the referee's whistle, the contender tried to hit the actuator to turn the light off. Each light turned off was worth 25 points. The contender was only allowed one attempt per light; no "second effort" was allowed. After each attempt, the contender returned to the center and repeated against the other warrior. This would continue for 60 seconds. In the 2nd season, all 8 lights (4 at each end) were lit up. The contender chose which light to go after and the warrior would have to stop them. Otherwise, the rules remained the same from season 1.

'''Rollercage of Fire (1st Season), Rollercage (2nd Season)'''

Contenders were raised up into a revolving [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] cage with holes built into it. In the 1st season, a ring of fire was set outside the cage at each end, mainly to set the atmosphere. The fire ring was removed in season two, as well as the reference to it in the event's title. Contenders had 60 seconds to force the warrior (Almost always T-Money, with 1 or 2 appearances by DOA in the later part of the 1st season) through one of the holes while avoiding the same fate. Forcing the warrior out earned 25 points (later 50). Draws originally scored nothing, but were later increased to a 25-point score.

'''Aerial Kickboxing'''

Contenders and opposing warriors hung from an undulating metal grid roughly 10 feet off the ground. The contender attempted to kick the warrior (most often Bubba King) off the grid within 60 seconds without being removed from the grid themselves. Kicks to the head were technically against the rules and would result in DQ's. At least 1 contender was DQ'd because of head shots. If the contender kicked the warrior off the grid, the contender scored 50 points. Draws scored 25 points. Most contenders were lucky to score short of a DQ of the warrior. Bubba King and Sleepwalker were almost impossible to beat, but O'Dell actually was impossible to defeat, as he never lost a match and rarely surrendered a draw.

*On one occasion, a contestant kicked Bubba King in the head. Bubba was stunned, but he still won.
After the match, the "reporter" had Bubba talk about the match. Bubba was angry, and complained about the contestant breaking the rules (by kicking him in the head), and Bubba said half his body went numb from the head kick.

'''G-Force'''

A central rotating tower had three arms extending from the top of the central tower.  Each of the contenders hung onto a handle at the end of each arm.  A warrior stood on a platform above this tower, throwing balls at the contenders as the tower spun.  The tower's speed increased steadily as the event progressed.  The last contender/s standing earned 25 points, and a bonus 25 points was earned for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Bridge'''

A large bridge spun quickly in mid-air. The contender and the warrior were each given a large padded club to use to knock the other off the bridge as it spun. Contenders scored 50 points for successfully knocking the warrior off the bridge, or 25 points for lasting 60 seconds.

'''Battle Field'''

This event was similar to [[List of American Gladiators events|Powerball]] on [[American Gladiators]]. Unlike Powerball, contenders competed one-on-one against a single warrior, who defended a single scoring bin. The scoring bin was located in the center of the playing field atop an approximately {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pyramid. The warrior wore boxing gloves and could freely attack the contender as much as they wanted to keep them from scoring. Each ball scored was worth 25 points.

'''Battle Hoop'''

Contenders began in the center of a circular field. A large hanging hoop moved around the outside perimeter of the field, with its opening always facing the center of the field. A warrior stood on the outside perimeter of the field to block the contender from jumping through the hoop. Contenders had 60 seconds to try to jump through the hoop as many times as they could, returning to the center after each attempt. Each successful pass through the hoop earned 25 points.

'''Battle Wall'''

Contenders had to get over three walls defended by the Battle Dome warriors. A warrior stood on the opposite side of each wall. Each wall was around 3 feet in height. The walls became narrower as the event went on making it harder to get by the warriors. Each wall that a contender was successful in climbing was worth 25 points.

'''Evader'''

A contender had to light targets while avoiding medicine balls being launched by two warriors. Contenders had 60 seconds to light up all the targets on the two towers (one at a time).  Originally, the warriors only had to hit the contenders 3 times to end the match, but it was later increased to 5 times.  Lighting up all the targets on a tower (this may not have ever been done) was worth 25 points and lighting up all the targets was worth 50.  This event was considered to be Jake Fury's signature event.

'''Anti-Gravity'''

This event, along with Interceptor, was always played last because of the point opportunities. Contenders had to light strips by hitting buttons on a grid while moving along handles placed on the grid. Every strip lit was worth 25 points, for a possible 150. The contenders were also chased by a Battle Dome Warrior, which was almost always The Commander, and could lose the game in one of two ways: either losing their grip, which would result in the contender floating away, or having the Warrior rip their harness off and send them to the floor.

'''Interceptor'''

Called a game of cat and mouse, a contender had to fly around the Interceptor grid lighting targets worth 25 points each until caught by the warrior (again, almost always The Commander) or time ran out. Each target was worth 25 points.  There was a maximum of 175 points available to the contenders.

'''Ultimate Body Slam'''

This was a tiebreaker, usually between the warriors for the right to hold the warrior belt. If the top warrior had been less than stellar and a fellow warrior close in the rankings had performed well, but not well enough to win the belt outright, the two warriors would compete in Ultimate Body Slam. This game was simply a test of endurance; each player stood on a platform behind a metal disk. The disks were then pulled back and slammed into each other at increasing speed until one of the two fell off and lost.

==Warriors==
During the first season, the warriors maintained distinct personalities, similar to [[professional wrestling]] characters. The warriors competed for the Battledome Belt. After each event the warriors were "ranked", according to how well they did in the competition. At the end of that days competition the top ranked warrior received the Battledome Belt. The "ranking" was done by the mysterious chairman. The chairman supposedly owned the Battledome. He was only seen in silhouette wearing a large [[cowboy hat]]. What little else was known about him is that he was supposedly an older man. Karen Ko was supposed to be his [[trophy wife]], and Bobbie Haven his secretary. It was Bobbie he would deliver the messages from The chairman to the other warriors and the fans. At the start of the second season The chairman, standings board and the Battledome Belt were dropped from the competition.

'''First season warriors'''

The original series had 9 warriors. Some competed every week with some making only a few appearances.

* Bubba King ([[Timothy Elwell]])
The "king" of aerial kickboxing. Had very few defeats and proved almost invincible with most challengers lasting a maximum of 30 seconds. Did not play any other event during the shows run.

* The Commander ([[Christian Boeving]])
Speciality event appeared to be Anti-Gravity with Interceptor a close second. One of the smaller warriors proved very speedy and powerful against challengers.

* Cuda ([[Randolph Jones]])
The largest warrior during season 1. Dominated Battle Wheel. Always appeared in the top position on this event. Did make fleeting appearances on other events.

* D.O.A. ([[Chad Bannon]])
Made few appearances in Season one but became much more prolific in Season 2. Speciality event appeared to be Rollercage.

* Jake Fury, ([[Gary Kasper]])
The wild and unpredictable Fury appeared in several games. Particularly able at games G- force and Evader. Suffered a severe ankle injury during season one while participating in Battle Wheel. Thankfully he recovered and did return for season 2.

* Michael O'Dell ([[Michael O'Hearn]])
The poster boy of Battledome. Handsome, toned and tanned. One of the most all round warriors. Played most games with Aerial Kickboxing and Takedown proving specialities.

* Payne ([[John Sperandeo]])
Appeared fleeting during season 1. Mainly as cover for injured warriors.  Entered arena wearing a straitjacket and howling. Difficult to tell what he was good at as he didn't participate in many events.

* Sleepwalker ([[Woon Young Park]])
Another warrior who seemed to be cover for fellow injured warriors. Did participate in Anti-Gravity and aerial kickboxing but suffered a shoulder injury in the event. Seemed very capable in events he participated in.

* T-Money ([[Terry Crews]])
Smug, arrogant and always accompanied by "The Posse". Blinged up with jewellery and a dollar sign chain around his neck. Very good at several games but Rollercage was his speciality. Did not take losing very well!

'''Second season warriors'''

Season 2 saw the departure of Payne and Sleepalker for unknown reasons. The remaining 7 warriors returned and were accompanied by 6 new warriors to bring the total up to 13.

'Returning Warriors:
* Bubba King
* The Commander
* Cuda
* D.O.A.
* Jake Fury
* Michael O'Dell
* T-Money

New Warriors 
* Baby Blue ([[Anthony McClanahan]])

* Johnny Rocco ([[Ron Cerenzo]])
Did not appear until later in the season then became a regular. Played several games. Takedown and Battle Hoop clearly his best.

* Snake ([[Jesse "Justice" Smith, Jr.]])
An all-rounder who participated in lots of games. No real stand out performances but very capable on events he played in.

* Mad Dog Steele([[Stefan Gamlin]])
Dominated his early appearances and Participated in many games. Got injured later in the season and did not appear again.

* Moose (Scott Milne)
Appeared only fleetingly during the series. Mainly as cover for injured warriors. The biggest of all warriors weighing over 300&amp;nbsp;lbs.

* The Prince ([[Maximilien Atoki]])
Another warrior who made on and off appearances throughout the season. Played a few games with Battle Wheel proving his speciality.

==The women of ''Battle Dome''==
A partial list of female companions:
* Nicole, Jaclyn and Erica Dahm – [[Nicole, Erica and Jaclyn Dahm|The Dahm Triplets]] – Always accompanied O'Dell during his outings. Unless they were tempted away by another warrior! 
* Bobbie Haven ([[Bobbie Brown]], best known for Warrant's "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]" music video) – The Chairman's very helpful and giving secretary...
* Angel (Karen Taucher) – Girlfriend of Jake Fury.

{{distinguish|Chorography}}
[[File:Zorn Cachucha.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Choreography for the Spanish dance [[Cachucha]], described using [[dance notation]]]]

'''Choreography''' is the [[art]] or practice of designing [[sequence]]s of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Visual appearance|form]], or both are specified. ''Choreography'' may also refer to the [[design]] itself. A '''choreographer''' is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as ''choreographing''. Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, [[cheerleading]], [[cinematography]], [[gymnastics]], [[fashion shows]], [[ice skating]], [[marching band]], [[show choir]], [[theatre]], [[synchronized swimming]], [[cardistry]], video game production and animated art. In the [[performing arts]], choreography applies to human movement and form. In [[dance]], choreography is also known as [[choreography (dance)|dance choreography]] or ''dance composition''.

==Etymology==
The word ''choreography'' literally means "dance-writing" from the Greek words "χορεία" (circular dance, see [[choreia (dance)|choreia]]) and "γραφή" (writing). It first appeared in the American English dictionary in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and "choreographer" was first used as a credit for [[George Balanchine]] in the Broadway show ''[[On Your Toes]]'' in 1936.&lt;ref name=Taper180&gt;

[[File:Card trick.jpg|thumb|Card trick. Upper left: "Pick a card, any card". Upper right: Back-palming a card. Bottom left: A "spring" flourish. Bottom right: A [[riffle shuffle]].]]
'''Close-up magic''' (also known as '''table magic''' or '''micromagic''') is [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] performed in an intimate setting usually no more than  ten feet (three metres)  from one's audience and is usually performed while sitting at a table.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark [1975] (1988). Mark Wilson's Complete Course In Magic. Courage Books. {{ISBN|0-89471-623-9}}. Card Magic, pp. 17-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Close-up magic can combine sleight-of-hand manipulations with [[card flourish]]es, and is called [[cardistry]]. 

[[Sleight-of-hand]], also known as prestidigitation ("quick fingers") or ''léger de main'' (Fr., "lightness of hand"), is the set of techniques used by a micromagician to manipulate objects such as cards and coins secretly.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Bill. Now You See It, Now You Don't!: Lessons in Sleight of Hand. Vintage. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Card flourish]]es are an example of skill rather than of illusion or deceit. It is the equivalent of [[juggling]] to a juggler.&lt;ref name="Hugard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hugard |first1=Jean |first2=Frederick |last2=Braué |first3=Paul |last3=Fleming |location=Mansfield Centre, CT |year=2015|title=The Royal Road to Card Magic |publisher=[[Dover Publications]], Martino Publishing |origyear=1999  |isbn=978-1614278603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two principal forms of micromagic are [[card tricks]] and [[coin tricks]] but any small item can be used for sleight-of-hand performances including dice, bottle caps, sugar cubes, sponge balls, pebbles, pens and [[cups and balls]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulves, Karl. Self-Working Table Magic: 97 Foolproof Tricks with Everyday Objects. Dover Publications. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for micromagicians to combine several of these objects in a single trick. Micromagician [[Johnny Ace Palmer]] produces baby chicks in his cups-and-balls routine.

Micromentalism is [[mentalism]] performed in an intimate session. This form of mentalism involves examples of [[telekinesis]], [[extrasensory perception]], [[precognition]] and [[telepathy]]. Most [[cold reading]] takes place in such an intimate session, as do most [[theatrical séance]]s.

The player's goal is to charm girls from National Star God Academy, raise their affection for Itsuki, then produce and take the "Star Children" to explore dungeons and battle "impurities".&lt;ref name="famitsu102111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="andriasang102611"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andriasang.com/comyrf/ |title=More Facts About Conception |author=Anoop Gantayat |date=October 26, 2011 |work= |publisher=Andriasang.com |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Performance''' is a very wide category filled with a range of productions, it is a generic [[performance]] but with an extra element of incorporating and integrating [[computer]] technologies and techniques into the production.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;Dixon, Steve (2007). ''Digital Performance''. Cambridge: MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-04235-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; You can incorporate [[multimedia]] into any type of performance whether it is live on a [[theatre]] stage or in the street. Anything as small as [[video recording]]s or a visual image classes the production as multimedia and therefore a digital performance. When the key role in a performance is the computer technologies rather than it being an additional role is when it is classed as a digital performance. This can be as little as projections on a screen in front of a live audience to creating and devising a performance in an online environment to using [[animation]] and sensing [[software]]’s.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

==Introduction==

If we were to look at the history of performance itself we would be able to find traces of digital performance from centuries ago, where it may be an old type of performance it is made new everyday by the increase in software and techniques and even by the uniqueness of performers' works, meanings and experiments. It is a continuing job to try and see how the acceptance of technology can increase the effects and spectacles of performances and [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Performances are normally reliant on the audience and obviously to receive a good reception from the audience so with the ongoing integration of multimedia within productions surprises the audience and keeps them on edge. It also deals with the emotional and sensorial impact of the audiences. The [[social]] [[Social influence|impact]] it has after the performance is out in the world and what meanings have come of the performance from different cliques of people.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

The Digital Performance Archive&lt;ref&gt;AHDS Performing Arts. "Digital Performance Archive", &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahds.ac.uk/performingarts/collections/dpa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123033925/http://ahds.ac.uk/performingarts/collections/dpa.htm |archivedate=2007-11-23 |df= }}&gt;, 2003, Retrieved 21/10/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; stores a lot of physical and catalogued archives from the 20th century, as they carried out a [[research project]], which involved the increase and creative use of [[computer technology]], and techniques within live theatre and [[dance]] productions to even [[cyberspace]] interactive dramas and [[webcast]]s.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Looking at a broad range of diverse productions would have enhanced their research project as they saw how each type of performance was affected and even how new types of performance came about due to the involvement of computer technologies and techniques and all other multimedia sources. Happenings also from the 20th century included new and emerging forms of drama and genres in performance; this occurred due to the active and escalating role of computer technology within all types of performances and productions. It became a significant and very important role within the society of live theatre.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Not only did it start to play a key role within theatre it also became a key role within our whole society, with businesses and [[education]] involving and using computers more and more as a convenience. As our society became more reliant on computers in everyday life it is exciting to then see how artists and performers use this everyday convenience to create new productions.

[[CD-ROM]]s, [[video game]]s and countless [[Art installation|installations]] exaggerated and performed by users, upped the level of interactive potential of computers.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; With computers becoming more and more accessible and popular as well as advanced with time so are the performances that contain them.&lt;ref&gt;InfoTech Trends. "Market Research", &lt;http://www.infotechtrends.com/marketresearch.htm&gt;, 1997, Retrieved 25/10.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first digital performance to present day trends have been set and this has been helped by the upgrades that surround computers. [[Artist]]s have followed each other’s works and therefore set trends of their own whilst the technology has set its own trends through upgrades and new software’s coming out which appeal to artists in the field. Another trend that is apparent is theoretical trends to do with all digital productions. Online environments are a strong base for theoretical trends as the frameworks are similar and sometimes the same.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

The largest base for theatre in the world is the [[World Wide Web]]; the [[Internet]] is seen as a satisfying place for relaxation and offers everyone who uses the Internet their ‘fifteen megabytes of fame.' Every single person who uses online networking sites, [[blog]]s, [[chat room]]s, [[MOO]]s and [[IRC]] is creating their own performance with the use of e-friendships.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Therefore it is not just the artists who deliberately devise theatrical events via the use of computer techniques and technologies.

The whole catalogue of Digital Performance is so diverse and a wide spread that it creates new and different visual and stylistic aspects. Computers have so many platforms available to create performances on that each production allows the artist/s or companies to gain extraordinary and unique experiences, new genres and experience new existences and beings via [[Virtual reality|virtual realities]].

The relationship formed between [[technology]] and [[art]] is a wonderful one. Two completely different areas joined together to create something new. They blend so well together and complement one another perfectly to become a strand under digital performance. ‘Performance is undertaking a shift in the conception of technology’.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; As the educational [[curriculum]] also upgrades with the latest technologies,&lt;ref&gt;American School and University. "Technology Push", &lt;http://asumag.com/Construction/technology/technology_push_university_president/&gt;, 2008, Retrieved 25/10/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; school/college/university students are becoming more aware of the techniques they can include in performances and they want to involve the digital side as it is seen as more modern nowadays and appeals to a wide audience.

Performers and devisors of digital performance productions have to approach the aspects of technology in diverse ways to be able to reach different meanings, content, drama, the impact of visuals and the audience-performer relationship. The computer is seen as the middle man, who fixes lasting problems rather than creating original and new performance processes and hype, in digital performance.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

==History==

The term Digital Performance can usually be defined to consist of all types of performance in which computer technologies have taken on the main role rather than an auxiliary one in the content, techniques, aesthetics or the delivery forms.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Performance Institute. "Definging Digital Performance", &lt;http://www.digitalperformance.org/node/1&gt;, 2003, Retrieved 25/10/11.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital performance will usually explore the representations of the [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]], [[dream]]s, and [[fantasy]] worlds.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

Over the past decade or so we have witnessed a very vast and incredible development within every aspect of the technological world. And as a result of this, there has been a large increase in the experimentation with computer technologies being integrated within the [[performing arts]]; and with the new technological creations and the developments of existing digital technologies they are also beginning to create a greater, more significant impact on the way in which different art forms are being practiced. [[Digital media]] now has a new and much more dramatic role to play in live theatre, dance and performance; and while digital media performances are now beginning to proliferate there are now many new forms of interactive performance genres that have emerged. These new genres are most commonly in the style of [[Audience participation|audience participatory]] installation pieces that can take place either on the internet or can be played on a CD – ROM. “Computers are arenas for social experience and dramatic interaction, a type of media more like public theatre, and their output is used for qualitative interaction, dialogue and conversation.”&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Allucquere. "The war of desire and technology at the close of the mechanical age", MIT Press, Cambridge, 1996. Retrieved 25/10/11.&lt;/ref&gt; The computer is vastly becoming a significant tool and agent of performative action and creation. Computer technologies can be contextualised as being of a social, cultural and artistic change. Computers do now permit for the artistic modes of expression and for the new generic forms of networking and interactive performance. Theatre itself has always been right at the cutting edge of technology and it has been quick on the mark to be able to recognise, and to take full advantage of the dramatic and aesthetic potentials that these new and existing technologies have to offer. Theatre, dance and [[performance art]] have always been known to be a form of multimedia; and right at the very core of the theatre through all the manifestations right to the contemporary experimentation, as well as incorporating all of the visual elements into a production; at the foreground to any piece there is the human voice and the spoken text.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

Locating the roots of digital performance practices can be traced back for many decades or even centuries. There are three main periods that can be highlighted in the history of multi - media performance; [[Futurism]] during the 1910s, mixed media performance during the 1960s and experimentation with a performance and the computer during the 1990s. Both during the eras of Futurism and the experimentation with computer incorporated within performance, they are both greatly inspired by the development of new and existing technology.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Researching back, digital performance practices have experimented with numerous of the different avant – garde movements which can date right back from the early twentieth century, some of these movements can include the likes of [[Bauhaus]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and many more. It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement. One of the main links that has been found which can connect futurism to digital performance was with the use of the ‘machine’ which was used in the set of [[Robert Lepage]]’s Zulu Time (1999). Although, it can be said that the avant – garde movement Futurism does have a more philosophical basis for contemporary digital performance, more so than any of the other avant – garde movements such as the likes of Bauhaus, Dada and Surrealism which are mainly used to provide inspiration for a large part of the content and styles for the artistic expression. Looking back at the early twentieth century avant – garde, there were many works that would use pre – digital technologies.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

One of the earliest examples of when theatre and film were being integrated together in a performance, with the use of digital technology was to try and challenge the distinction between what is ‘liveness’ as in the live performer on the stage and the media imagery, it is about the relationship between the virtual and the actual performance being the dialogical [[interactivity]]. With the increased usage of digital media in a performance, not all performances are necessarily live, without the body’s physical presence it could be argued whether this is this still live theatre or just a set of media images and footage. Theatre pieces which have integrated digital media and computer generated projections built into performances have a long historical lineage that stretches back to over a hundred years ago to an experiment that was conducted by [[Loie Fuller]]. Fuller was the first modern dance choreographer to try out and to use new technology within her performance work. In 1911, Fuller, a dancer, conducted an experiment where she used film footage and projected it onto diaphanous robes. In the performance, as Fuller danced the robes in which she was wearing became a sort of ‘screen’ where multi – coloured lights were projected upon it. This was one of the first pieces of theatre where film footage was integrated into becoming a part of a live theatre performance.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

From the early 1960s, computer generated imagery had then began to emerge as a distinctive art form, and in [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney’s]] film Catalog (1961) viewers witnessed one of films’ first ever uses of computer transformations.  Although digital arts had been developing since the 1960s, in the 1990s computer technologies had become much more accessible to artists which then led to a large increase in the digital performance activity. It was during this time that computer [[computer hardware|hardware]] was built to become much more “user – friendly” and we then witnessed the invention of the [[digital camera]] and the home PC’s ([[Personal computer|Personal Computer]]) and the establishment of the World Wide Web. It was during this period of time which would then go on to be known as being the ‘[[Digital Revolution]]’. During the period of the ‘Digital Revolution’ there was a great influence on the aesthetics, creation and culture of the performance arts; this had a significant effect on the process for film and television production to the creative writing and the visual and performance arts.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

From 1970 there was a period of time of when theatrical experimentation elevated the visual over the verbal; there was a proliferation in the use of media projections in theatre, dance and performance art, using both screens and video monitors. With the ease of using these [[video]] technologies more and more artists began to play around with the possibilities of integrating visual media within their live performance work. The use of media technology including the likes of film, video and sound equipment became some of the main characteristics for the [[experimental theatre]], and some of the most noted performance artists of this time were creating work by incorporating video and film footage into their theatre productions. By the 1990s multimedia and computer technologies had widely become a part of everyday life. In live multimedia theatre: the projection screens or video monitor frame additional space, in two dimensions. Media screens are able to provide a uniquely flexible space, unlike the fixed point of view in which a traditional theatre provides to the members of the audience. Moving towards the end of the twentieth century digital computer technologies have become increasingly more ubiquitous.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

As digital media has now become more and more popular over the years, the perception of digital images and videos now are now lacking in legitimacy as these technologies have gradually intensified over the past few years. Digital performance is an expansion of a constantly progressing history of which embracing the adaptation of these new and already existing technologies, in which to amplify a performance and the visual art aesthetic effect, and to create the sense of a spectacle as well as capturing the emotional and the sensorial impact.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

==Production examples==

Video conferencing is also a part of digital performance, some theatre companies (such as ‘The Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre’&lt;ref&gt;The Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre. "GSRT", &lt;http://www.gertstein.org/&gt;, 2005, Retrieved 24/10.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘Kunstwerk-Blend’&lt;ref&gt;Lycouris, S. "Kunstwerk-Blend", &lt;http://www.ad406.dial.pipex.com/&gt;, 1997, Retrieved 24/10/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced this into their productions to bring different performers from different locations together live on stage to create a lively new brand of digital performance. The Internet is used as a base for these productions with text-based online environments such as [[MUD]]s and MOOs as well as the use of [[webcam]]s and webcasts. They all created new forms to come under the live and interactive performance area. With the ongoing increase of internet users more and more people are made accessible to these software’s therefore more and more artists are experimenting and devising performances using computer technologies which them branches out and raises the number of digital performances and productions.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

Another case of what is under the title of digital performance is dance productions, using software and computer techniques such as advanced animation and [[Motion capture|motion capturing]]. You can project images of your virtual dancers made on to the stage.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; As you are using computer techniques and software to project on to a stage, which has a live audience the performance/production, then becomes digital due to the elements involved. Software that is highly involved with digital performance is custom-made [[motion sensing]]; this software allows you to control images, avatars, sounds and lighting live on stage.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; This is important for today’s artists and audiences, as audiences are looking for something new and memorable. Artists are equally looking to create something new that will grab audiences, this software allows this to happen as you can experiment and change as much as you like live.

Communication through the Internet has been classed as a type of digital performance as it has been theorized as a type of virtual performance of the self. As this is so, people have already stated digital performance as being everywhere, which has led to digital performance being modernized itself. It has been noted as incorporating the elements of [[electronics]] in everyday life through the communicational and production elements.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt;

Some strands of performing have always been seen as multimedia forms such as theatre, dance and performance art. Dance involves an intimate relationship with [[music]] for a start. All three of the above are involved with visual aspects such as sets, props, lighting and costume which are all a part of the production to enhance the body/bodies in a space.&lt;ref name="Dixon"/&gt; Using such aspects makes the performance become multimedia and that is becoming more advanced with the new techniques that computers are upgrading to therefore making digital performance a strong and popular area to study.

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

'''Dwarf-tossing''', or '''midget-tossing''', is a [[Public house|pub]]/[[Bar (establishment)|bar]] attraction in which people with [[dwarfism]], wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes, are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro-coated walls.&lt;ref&gt;International Dwarf Tossing Association&lt;/ref&gt; Participants compete to throw the dwarf the farthest. A related formerly practiced activity was dwarf-bowling, in which a person with dwarfism was placed on a skateboard and used as a bowling ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php Dwarf Bowling on Staten Island Lands in Gutter: Gothamist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002832/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwarf Tossing was started in Australia as a form of Pub entertainment in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ozzienews.com/news/is-dwarf-tossing-coming-to-melbourne/ Dwarf Tossing Coming to Melbourne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistededge.org/Funny_As_Hell/World_According/Midget_Throwing/ World according to Midget Throwing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===Australia===
Commonly thought of as the place where dwarf tossing originated. Laws may prohibit dwarf tossing implicitly, but there are not explicit laws preventing a consenting dwarf from being 'tossed'.

===Canada===
In [[Ontario]], Canada, the Dwarf Tossing Ban Act was introduced in 2003 by [[Windsor West]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] [[Sandra Pupatello]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=1128 Dwarf Tossing Ban Act, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[private member's bill|private member's public bill]] did not proceed beyond its introduction to second or third readings, nor did it receive royal assent, and therefore died at the close of the 37th [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"/&gt; The bill proposed a fine of not more than $5,000, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both. The bill was hastily advanced in response to a dwarf-tossing contest&lt;ref name="OntLA2"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/2003-06-12_L025.htm#PARA511 Legislative Assembly of Ontario Transcript of Debates for Thursday, June 12, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; that was held at Leopard's Lounge in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario with a dwarf nicknamed "Tripod".&lt;ref name = "GlobeAndMail1"&gt;{{cite news

===France===
The [[mayor]] of the small French town of [[Morsang-sur-Orge]] prohibited dwarf-tossing. The case went through the appeal chain of administrative courts to the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', which found that an administrative authority could legally prohibit dwarf-tossing on grounds that the activity did not respect human [[dignity]] and was thus contrary to public order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007877723 Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°136727, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The question raised legal questions as to what was admissible as a motive for an administrative authority to ban an activity for motives of public order, especially as the ''conseil'' did not want to include "public morality" in public order. The ruling was taken by the full assembly and not a smaller panel—proof of the difficulty of the question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062531/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html |date=27 September 2011 }} of the ruling on the Conseil d'État's site&lt;/ref&gt; The ''conseil'' ruled similarly in another case between an entertainment company and the city of [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007882056&amp; Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°143578, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Human Rights Committee decided on July 26, 2002, that the ban was not discriminatory with respect to dwarfs. It ruled that the ban could be considered as "necessary to protect public order, which brings into play considerations of human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1010&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, dwarf-tossing is not prohibited outright in France. The ''Conseil d'État'' decided that a public authority could use gross infringement on human dignity as a motive of public order to cancel a spectacle, and that dwarf-tossing constituted such a gross infringement. However, it is up to individual authorities to make specific decisions regarding prohibition.

===United States===
Robert and Angela Van Etten, [[Florida]] members of the [[Little People of America]], convinced the state's legislators in 1989 that dwarf-tossing be made illegal.

In 2001, Dave Flood, who appeared on the MJ Morning Show as "Dave the Dwarf," filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1989 law allowing the state to fine or revoke the [[liquor license]] of a bar that allows dwarf-tossing. The pastime was popular in some Florida bars in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lQFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1342,4094341 "Florida Radio Personality Files Suit to Allow Return of 'Dwarf Tossing'"].

In October 2011, [[Ritch Workman]] introduced legislation that would overturn the ban on dwarf-tossing, claiming such a ban to be an "unnecessary burden on the freedom and liberties of people" and "an example of Big Brother government". Although not a personal advocate of the activity, Workman stated "if a little person wants to make a fool out of themselves for money, they should have the same right to do so as any average sized person".&lt;ref name="PBP dwarves"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/cerabino-lawmaker-wants-state-to-reinstate-dwarf-tossing-1898183.html |work=The Palm Beach Post |first=Frank |last=Cerabino |title=Lawmaker Wants State to Reinstate Dwarf Tossing |date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the statue Ethos.jpg|thumb|A sculpture representing Ethos outside the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] in Canberra, Australia]]
'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fabrice Morvan''' (born 14 May 1966) is a French singer-songwriter, dancer and model. He was half of the pop duo [[Milli Vanilli]], with [[Rob Pilatus]], selling multi-platinum albums around the world. However, he was later involved in one of the largest [[scandal]]s in pop music history when it was revealed that neither he nor Pilatus had actually sung on any of Milli Vanilli's recordings. After the scandal, the group reformed as [[Rob &amp; Fab]] in the 1990s with limited success. Morvan  had a solo comeback in the 2000s releasing his first solo album, ''[[Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album)|Love Revolution]]''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Morvan was born in 1966 in Paris, France, to parents from [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/milli-vanilli-p4917/biography|title=Milli Vanilli – Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18, he moved to Germany, where he was a dancer and model, and was influenced by [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. He met Rob Pilatus in a nightclub in [[Munich]]. They decided to form a rock/soul group.

=== Fame ===
Morvan and Pilatus were noticed by music producer [[Frank Farian]], who signed them as part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to [[Turkey]], where they reputedly got the band's name from a local advertising [[slogan]], Milli Vanilli was born. Morvan and Pilatus served as the public faces for singers [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]], John Davis, and [[Brad Howell (singer)|Brad Howell]], who Farian thought were talented musicians but lacked a marketable image.

The first Milli Vanilli album was ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]''. Despite critical derision, Milli Vanilli's fame continued to grow worldwide. The album had four hit singles: [[Girl You Know It's True (song)|the title track]], and the group's three #1 hits, "[[Girl I'm Gonna Miss You]]", "[[Baby Don't Forget My Number]]", and "[[Blame It on the Rain]]". Milli Vanilli won the [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist on 22 February 1990 for ''Girl You Know It's True''.

Morvan and Pilatus were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of on-stage [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] and not having sung on the album. Shaw told a reporter the truth about Milli Vanilli, but recanted after Farian paid him $150,000 to do so{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} .

When Morvan and Pilatus pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus had not actually sung on any of the records. As a result, Milli Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later and [[Arista Records]] dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, thus making ''Girl You Know It's True'' one of the largest-selling albums to ever be taken out of print. A court allowed any American who bought the album to get a refund.

Farian would later attempt a failed comeback for the group without Morvan and Pilatus.

===Aftermath===
Months later, Morvan and Pilatus parodied the scandal in a commercial for Carefree [[Chewing gum|sugarless gum]]. They began to lip sync to an opera recording. An announcer asked as they were lip synching, "How long does the taste of Carefree sugarless gum last?" The record then began to skip and the announcer answers, "Until these guys sing for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1331F937A25755C0A967958260|title=Milli Vanilli Appears Again|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=14 June 1991|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then moved to [[Los Angeles]], where they released an eponymous album under the name ''[[Rob &amp; Fab]]''. Despite positive reviews from critics, the album failed due to financial constraints, poor promotion, and the scandal surrounding Milli Vanilli's lip-synching allegations. The album itself only sold around 2,000 copies.

Pilatus later served three months jail for assault, vandalism, and attempted robbery. He spent six months on drug rehabilitation before returning to Germany. He died of an alcohol and prescription drug overdose at a hotel in [[Frankfurt]] on 2 April 1998.

===Solo comeback===
Morvan spent several years as a [[session musician]] and [[public speaker]]. In 1998, he was hired as a [[radio programming|radio]] [[Disc jockey#Radio DJs|DJ]] at famed L.A. radio station [[KIIS-FM]]. During this time, he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 [[Wango Tango]] festival concert before 50,000 people at [[Dodger Stadium]].

In 1997, Morvan was interviewed for the premiere episode of [[VH1|VH-1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''. He was also featured in a 2000 [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] documentary on Milli Vanilli. Morvan then spent 2001 on tour, before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the [[Hard Rock Café]] Hotel in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, ''[[Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album)|Love Revolution]]'', producing, recording, writing and singing all the tracks. On 14 April 2011, Morvan released a new single, "Anytime", to digital outlets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 25 May 2012, Morvan released a single, "See the Light" with a new band, Fabulous Addiction.

In March 2014, it was mentioned that Morvan was working on his next single in Los Angeles with Grammy-winning viral producer [[Clarence Jey]] and Grammy-winning singer Delious Kennedy from U.S. R&amp;B group [[All-4-One]].

Morvan also DJs for private [[Heineken International|Heineken]] functions at the [[Heineken Experience]] center in Amsterdam. As a solo musician, Morvan has worked with several DJ/producers including [[Don Diablo]], Guy J, Dance Spirit, Desert Minds, DJ Prinz, Patrick BP Bruyndonx, MuziJunki, Sean McCaff, Limoncello, Guan Elmzoom, and has collaborated on well-received dance releases with several. Some of his other pursuits include writing, painting and fashion design.

=== Film and ''Best of the Best'' album ===
On 14 February 2007, it was announced that [[Universal Pictures]] was developing a film based on the true story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall in the music industry. [[Jeff Nathanson]], screenwriter from ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', was to write and direct the film. Morvan was supposed to serve as a consultant, providing his and Pilatus' point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117959531.html?categoryid=16&amp;cs=18query=Milli+Vanilli+film Variety.com : Universal sets up Milli Vanilli film]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Michael Fleming, 14 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/20/girl-you-know-its-true-milli-vanill-biopic-will-reveal-the-truth/ RollingStone.com : Girl, You Know It's True: Milli Vanilli Biopic will reveal the truth (!)], by Nicole Frehsee, 20 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was never completed. In 2011 German director [[Florian Gallenberger]] declared that he was reviving the project and would be rewriting the script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/02/the-milli-vanilli-film “Milli Vanilli” Movie Gets Rewrite And New Director, FIX, 16 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2007, the Milli Vanilli ''[[Best of the Best (Milli Vanilli album)|Best of the Best]]'' album was released.

Morvan now resides in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Los Angeles]] as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20446957,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This page is about the automobile sport. For the 1957 film starring Stanley Baker, see [[Hell Drivers (film)]]''
[[File:Car rolling in a crash (AM 81275-1).jpg|thumb|Chrysler rolling in a crash.]]
'''Hell Drivers''' -  numerous automobile thrill-based productions performing at fairs and racetracks by various squads of stunt drivers since the 1930s. Earl "Lucky" Teter was the first to coin the phrase ''Hell Drivers'', when he began touring his show in 1934. Hell Drivers provided audiences with a show filled with precision driving and deliberate crashes.  

Featured stunts included driving cars on two wheels, crashing through flaming barricades, and jumping an automobile ramp to ramp through mid air.  For many years, Hell Drivers were used to demonstrate the dependability of a manufacturer's automotive product. Major Hell Driver automotive sponsors have included [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], [[Chrysler]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], and [[Toyota]].

Later thrill shows coining the phrase "Hell Drivers" were launched by such drivers and race promoters as [[Jack Kochman]], [[John Francis "Irish" Horan]], [[Danny Fleenor]], Geoff Williams and [[Joie Chitwood]]. Chitwood bought Teter's Hell Drivers from Teter's widow after Teter was killed in a jump in 1943. Ford Motor Company supplied cars and financed Chitwood for several years until the mid 50's when Chitwood switched to Chevrolet after unsuccessfully trying Plymouth for a year. 

General Manager of Kochman's troupe was Bob Conto. Conto, a native of Malone, New York in the state's North Country was a former radio-television announcer whose staccato delivery kept pace with the 50-mile per hour events.

The Danish city of Aalborg is known internationally as the world's centre of Hell Drivers

Currently, the only traditional new-car stunt show in the United States is the Black Cat Hell Drivers, produced by Johnny Wisner.

There is a current documentary produced by filmmaker Dan T. Hall and Vizmo Films about the life and times of Lucky Teter.

Early [[hip hop]] hype men included Cowboy and Creole of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name= Hilltop/&gt;&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop/&gt; [[Kool Moe Dee]] calls Creole “the original hype man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/moedee.htm |title=Kool Moe Dee |publisher=Thafoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Enemy 4.jpg|thumb|right|American rapper [[Flavor Flav]] hyping up a crowd in May 2008]]
The quintessential hype man, for many fans and musicians of the era, was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s hype man [[Flavor Flav]], whose exuberant approach to the art in the group's recordings and videos made him, arguably, the first household-name hype man, a figure more famous than many MCs. He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to [[Chuck D]]'s booming baritone).

==Examples==&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE WITHOUT RELIABLE CITATIONS --&gt;

'''Kuso''' is the term used in [[East Asia]] for the [[internet culture]] that generally includes all types of [[camp (style)|camp]] and [[parody]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{Nihongo|kuso|糞,くそ}} means "crap" or "[[shit]]" and "bullshit", and is often uttered as an interjection. It is also used to describe outrageous matters and objects of poor quality. This definition of kuso was brought into Taiwan around 2000 by young people who frequently visited Japanese websites and quickly became an [[internet phenomenon]], spreading to [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] and subsequently to the rest of [[China]]. 

==Etymology==
In Chinese kuso is called "e'gao" (S: 恶搞, T: 惡搞, P: ''ègǎo''), with the first character meaning "evil" or "gross" and the second meaning "to make fun of [someone/something]." In 2007 the word was so new that it was not listed in Chinese dictionaries.{{update inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="egao"&gt;Wu, Jiao. "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/22/content_788600.htm E'gao: Art criticism or evil?]" ''[[China Daily]]''. January 22, 2007. Retrieved on January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Christopher Rea, "E’gao, the main buzzword associated with online Chinese parody, literally means “evil doings” or “malicious manipulation”"; he notes that e'gao's "semantic associations [to kuso] can be misleading, however, since e’gao is not fundamentally scatological—or even, as the Chinese term might suggest, malicious. In its broad usage, it may be applied to parody of any stripe, from fan tribute-mimicry to withering mockery. In a more restricted sense, it refers the practice of digitally manipulating mass culture products to comic effect and circulating them via the internet. The term e’gao may thus be interpreted in multiple senses, as it denotes variously a genre, a mode, a practice, an ethos and a culture."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, “Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.”In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The root of Taiwanese "kuso" was ''kuso-ge'' from [[Japan]]. The word ''[[kusoge]]'' is a [[clipped compound]] of ''kuso'' and ''gēmu'' (ゲーム, game), which means, quite literally, "crappy (video) games." The introduction of such a category originally was to teach gamers how to appreciate and enjoy a game of poor quality—such as appreciating the games' outrageous flaws instead of becoming frustrated by them. This philosophy soon spread to Taiwan, where people would share the games and often satirical comments on [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es. Games generally branded as kuso in Taiwan include ''[[Hong Kong 97 (video game)|Hong Kong 97]]'' and the ''[[Death Crimson]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Because ''kuso-ge''s were often unintentionally funny, soon the definition of kuso in Taiwan shifted to "anything hilarious," and people started to brand anything outrageous and funny as kuso. Parodies, such as the Chinese [[robot]] [[Xianxingzhe]] ridiculed by a Japanese website, were marked as kuso. [[Mo lei tau]] films by [[Stephen Chow]] are often said to be kuso as well. The [[Cultural Revolution]] is often a subject of parody too, with songs such as ''[[I Love Beijing Tiananmen]]'' spread around the internet for laughs.

Some, however, limit the definition of kuso to "humour limited to those about [[Hong Kong comics]] or Japanese [[anime]], [[manga]], and games." Kuso by such definitions are primarily [[doujin]] or [[fanfiction]]. [[Fictional crossover]]s are common media for kuso, such as redrawing certain [[bishōjo]] anime in the style of ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', or blending elements of two different items together. (For example, in ''[[Densha de D]]'', both ''[[Initial D]]'' and ''[[Densha de Go!]]'' are parodied, as [[Initial D characters and teams|Takumi]] races trains and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]]s his railcar across multiple railway tracks.)

In [[China]], earlier ''e gao'' works consisted of images edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]]. An example of this would be the [[Little Fatty]] internet meme.&lt;ref&gt;Meng 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10560">'''Literary forgery''' (also known as '''literary mystification''', '''literary [[fraud]]''' or '''literary [[hoax]]''') is writing, such as a [[manuscript]] or a [[literary work]], which is either deliberately misattributed to a historical or invented author, or is a purported [[memoir]] or other presumably nonfictional writing deceptively presented as true when, in fact, it presents untrue or imaginary information.

== History ==
Literary [[forgery]] may involve the work of a famous author whose writings have an established intrinsic, as well as monetary, value.  In an attempt to gain the rewards of such a reputation, the forger often engages in two distinct activities. The forger produces a writing which resembles the [[Style (fiction)|style]] of the known reputable author to whom the fake is to be attributed.  The forger may also fake the physical alleged original [[manuscript]]. This is less common, as it requires a great deal of technical effort, such as imitating the ink and paper.  The forger then claims that, not only is the style of writing the same, but also that the ink and paper are of the kind or type used by the famous author. Other common types of literary forgery may draw upon the potential historical cachet and novelty of a previously undiscovered author.

Literary forgery has a long history. [[Onomacritus]] (c. 530 – 480 BCE) is among the most ancient known literary forgers.  He invented [[prophecy|prophecies]], which he ascribed to the bard [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Ehrman, ''Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are'', HarperOne (2011){{ISBN|0062012614}}, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century CE, a certain Septimius produced what appeared to be a Latin translation of an eyewitness account to the [[Trojan War]] by [[Dictys of Crete]].  In the letter of dedication, the translator gave additional credence to the document by claiming the Greek original had come to light during [[Nero]]'s reign when Dictys' tomb was opened by an earthquake and his diary was discovered.  Septimius then claimed the original had been handed to the governor of Crete, [[Publius Rutilius Rufus|Rutilius Rufus]], who gave the diary to Nero during his tour of Greece in 66-67 CE.  According to historian Miriam Griffin, such bogus and romantic claims to antiquity were not uncommon at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nero: The end of a Dynasty, Miram T. Griffin, 1984. Chapter 9. {{ISBN|0415214645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longest lasting literary forgeries is by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a 5th-6th century Syrian mystical writer who claimed to be a disciple of [[Paul the Apostle]].  Five hundred years later, [[Abelard]] expressed doubts about the authorship, but it was not until after the Renaissance that there was general agreement that the attribution of the work was false.  In the intervening 1,000 years, the writings had much theological influence.&lt;ref&gt;
Sarah Coakley (Editor), Charles M. Stang (Editor), ''Re-thinking Dionysius the Areopagite'', Wiley-Blackwell (2009), {{ISBN|978-1405180894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Chatterton]] (1752–1770), the English poet and letter writer, began his brilliant medieval forgeries when little more than a child. While they brought him praise, and fame after his death, his writing afforded little in the way of financial success and he committed suicide aged 17, penniless, alone and half-starved.

[[The English Mercurie]] appeared to be the first English newspaper when it was discovered in 1794.  This was, ostensibly, an account of the English battle with the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588, but was, in fact, written in the 18th century by [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke]], as a literary game with his friends.&lt;ref&gt;''Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', Volume 9, January 18, 1840, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary forgery was promoted as a creative method by [[Charles Nodier]] and, in the 19th century, many writers produced literary forgeries under his influence, notably [[Prosper Merimee]] and [[Pierre Louys]].

''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' was an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] forged document first published in Russia. The abridged version was available to the public in 1903. The unabridged version was later edited by a retired officer of the Russian Imperial Guard, G.V. Butmi. This forgery exploits Jews by stating that Jews were inevitably trying to exercise a coup against [[Christianity]] in order to essentially rule the world. The document was exposed as [[plagiarism]] by English journalist [[Philip Graves]] in 1921. Graves exposed the strong similarities in the political satire by [[Maurice Joly]], ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]''.  The forged document was supported and promoted by [[Henry Ford]] in his newspaper, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Philip|title=The Truth about the Protocols: A Literary Forgery|year=1921|publisher=The Times of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake memoirs==
The [[genre]] of false and deceptive [[autobiography]] or [[fake memoirs]] has seen the rise of [[misery lit]] books, in which the author claims to have suffered illness, abuse, and/or drug abuse during his or her upbringing.

[[Stephen Longstreet]], a prolific and popular novelist in the mid-20th century, referred to and eventually produced a manuscript called ''Nell Kimball: Her Life as an American Madam, by herself,'' allegedly penned by a prostitute who lived from (1854-1934) and worked in New Orleans. Additionally, the work was partly plagiarized from the works of [[Herbert Asbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:longstreet&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes|title=Guide to the Stephen Longstreet Papers|last=|first=|date=|website=Yale.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A recent example is ''Love and Consequences'' by Margaret B. Jones, the author's story about being a young American foster girl who was raised in a gangland culture in Los Angeles involving drugs, forced sex and criminality.  The author, real name [[Margaret Seltzer]], was exposed as a fraud by her elder sister: in reality, she has lived a middle-class life without trauma, and received a good education (which also included a course in [[creative writing]]).&lt;ref&gt;William McGowan, ''Gray Lady Down: What the Decline and Fall of the New York Times Means'',  pp. 160-161, Encounter books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1594034862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Lewis James|Danny Santiago]], author of ''Famous All Over Town'', published a novel in which he depicts life through the eyes of a young Hispanic boy growing up in East Los Angeles.  The novel won the Rosenthal Award for Literary Achievement in 1984, though suspicion arose about the true identity of Danny Santiago when the author refused to supply a biographical sketch for editors at Simon &amp; Schuster who wanted to submit the book for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Folkart, Burt A. "OBITUARIES : Daniel James : Writer Who Masqueraded as a Latino."Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Times, 21 May 1988. Web. 24 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-21/news/mn-2879_1_daniel-james&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation revealed that the writer was actually Daniel James, a middle- to older-aged Caucasian male writing from the standpoint of a young Latino American boy.  He received criticism from the literary community, and gave up writing for good.

[[James Frey]], another author chastised for forging his memoir, published ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a memoir about his struggle with drug addiction and his journey through the inner working of the legal system and rehabilitation.  The truth about his "imagined escapades" eventually came to light when his close family and friends revealed that he had actually never been a drug addict or incarcerated.  Frey eventually faced more than 10 [[class action]] lawsuits, including negligence, false advertising, and breach of contract.  At the heart of each suit was an allegation of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Simon. "Sentimental Frauds." Law &amp; Social Inquiry 36.1 (2011): 83-113. Academic Search Premier. Web. 24 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Low comedy''', in association to [[comedy]], is a dramatic or literary form of [[entertainment]] with no primary purpose but to create [[laughter]] by [[boasting]], boisterous jokes, [[drunkenness]], scolding, [[fighting]], [[buffoonery]] and other riotous activity.&lt;ref&gt;low comedy. (2013). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349662/low-comedy&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by "horseplay", [[slapstick]] or [[farce]]. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the [[wedgie]].

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays.  Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers.  Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: [[stand-up comedians]], [[musicals]], etc.  This type of comedy also was employed in most [[cartoons]].

== Society ==
Low comedy in [[society]] is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of [[mass media|media]], such as [[television]] and [[theatre]]. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term ''low'' is represented in association to [[low culture]]. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;.  Gans, H. J. (1975). Popular culture and high culture; an analysis and evaluation of taste. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. 

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to [[high comedy]]. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.&lt;ref&gt;By, B. A. (1934, Jan 21). Salute to low comedy. New York Times (1923-Current File). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/101030559&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of [[sitcoms]] in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, M. (1995, Oct 30). Low comedy of 'high society'. USA TODAY. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/408705508&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=April 2014}}  Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10304">A '''media franchise''', also known as '''multimedia franchise''', is a collection of related [[Media (communication)|media]] in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work, such as a [[film]], a work of [[literature]], a [[television program]] or a [[video game]]. The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for [[merchandising]] purposes.

A media franchise often consists of [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and can create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers ([[fandom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jaylemke.squarespace.com/storage/Games-Franchises-CulturalOrder-2005.pdf | title=Critical Analysis across Media: Games, Franchises, and the New Cultural Order | publisher=First International Conference on CDA | date=2004 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Lemke, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4#.UjcTWD-9H-s | title=The Culture and Business of Cross-Media Productions | author=Aarseth, Espen | journal=Popular Communication: the International Journal of Media and Culture | year=2006 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=203 | doi=10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Idol]] was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] signing with [[RCA Records]] and having the release of ''[[A Moment Like This]]'' becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100.&lt;ref name=ai&gt;{{cite book | title=Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide | publisher=NYU Press | author=Jenkins, Henry | year=2006 | page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an ''American Idol'' book that made the bestseller list and the film ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]''.&lt;ref name=ai /&gt; A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term "media franchise." The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' book series]] that was adapted into the five films of ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bitten by Twilight: Youth Culture, Media, and the Vampire Franchise | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | author=Click, Melissa | year=2010 | page=12 | isbn=978-1433108945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including '''metaseries'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which can be used to describe works such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;Palumbo, Donald. "Asimov's Crusade Against Bigotry: The Persistence Of Prejudice as a Fractal Motif in the Robot/Empire Foundation Metaseries." JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS 10 (1998): 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, "[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:

{{quote|"In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, [[The Wachowskis|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], creators of ''[[The Matrix trilogy]]'', produced the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie's actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by [[Michel Ancel]] and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars films'' (1999–2005); all five ''[[Harry Potter films]]'' (2001–2008); all three ''[[Spider-Man films]]'' (2002–2007); ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007); and ''[[Transformers]]'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises"|source=Harry Brown, ''Videogames and Education''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Development to other forms==
===Fiction===
Long-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include [[Andy Hardy]], [[Ma and Pa Kettle]], [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Superman]], [[Tarzan]], and [[Batman]]. The longest-running modern film franchises include [[James Bond]], [[Godzilla]], ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.

Media franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as [[Nancy Drew]], [[Miss Marple]], and other popular [[detective]]s, as well as popular [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in [[novel]]s, particularly those in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into [[animated television series]], video games, or both.

A media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' or the [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|''National Lampoon'' series]], and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/how-to-kill-a-major-media-franchise-in-a-decade | title=How To Kill A Major Media Franchise In A Decade | publisher=Buzzfeed | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Bernstein, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-fiction===
[[Non-fiction]] literary franchises include the ''[[...For Dummies]]'' and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]'' [[reference book]]s. An enduring and extensive example of a media franchise is [[Playboy Enterprises]], which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, ''[[Playboy]]'', within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (''Playboy's Penthouse'', in 1959), and even its own [[Playboy TV|television channel]]. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, [[Playboy Radio|a radio show]], [[direct to video]] films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.

'''Moviefone''' is an [[United States|American]]-based movie listing and information service. Moviegoers can obtain local showtimes, theatre information, film reviews, or advance tickets. The service is owned by [[Helios and Matheson | Helios and Matheson Analytics]].

==History==
In 1989, [[Russ Leatherman]], Rob Gukeisen, [[Andrew Jarecki]], Pat Cardamone, and Adam Slutsky launched the interactive telephone service, with initial service in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Russ Leatherman provided the voice of "Mr. Moviefone" for the automated phone service.{{cn|date=July 2018}} After gaining popularity, it later expanded across the United States and eventually adopted an online presence as Moviefone.com.

In 1999, [[AOL]]  purchased Moviefone for $388 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/02/01/deals/moviefone/?iid=EL |title=AOL buys MovieFone |publisher=[[CNN]]  |date=February 1, 1999 |accessdate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Moviefone entered into a partnership with [[MovieTickets.com]] that crosslinked their ticketing offerings; by 2004, Moviefone's online arm was acquired outright by MovieTickets.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movietickets.com/press.asp?year=2004&amp;pr_id=42 |website=MovieTickets.com |title=Press release|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012, Moviefone announced a partnership with MovieTickets.com's rival [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Verrier, Richard |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fandango-20120523,0,812900.story |title=Fandango and Moviefone dial up new partnership|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lucas Shaw|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/13767140/fandango-and-moviefone-partner-for-ticket-sales/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716080905/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/13767140/fandango-and-moviefone-partner-for-ticket-sales/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 16, 2012|title=Fandango and Moviefone partner for ticket sales|work=Reuters|date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2014, it was reported that Moviefone would be shutting down its call-in service and its "777-FILM" phone number but would maintain its mobile app services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/business/media/moviefone-is-hanging-up-but-its-app-will-go-on.html?rref=business&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;pgtype=Blogs |title=Moviefone Is Hanging Up, but Its App Will Go On|work=New York Times |date=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2014, Moviefone was relaunched with a new look, an expansion into TV content, and a comprehensive search tool that allows users to find theaters, channels, and streaming services offering movies and television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/business/media/moviefone-will-add-broadcast-and-on-demand-tv-information.html?rref=business/media&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Media&amp;pgtype=article|date= May 5, 2014|title=Moviefone will add broadcast and on-demand TV information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5th, 2018, [[Helios and Matheson|Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc.]], the majority owner of movie ticketing service [[MoviePass]], announced the acquisition of Moviefone from [[Oath Inc.]] for $1 million in cash and $8 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Fritz|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/upstart-moviepass-to-join-with-cinema-service-moviefone-1522930504/|title=Upstart MoviePass to Join With Cinema Service Moviefone|work=Wall Street Journal|date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/04/05/moviepass-buys-moviefone/|title=MoviePass Just Bought Moviefone.

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With [[Frederick Luis Aldama]], [[Brian McHale]] and [[Robyn Warhol]], Phelan directs [[Project Narrative]] at [[The Ohio State University]]:)

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''news agency''' is an organization that gathers [[news]] reports and sells them to subscribing news organizations, such as [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. A news agency may also be referred to as a &lt;!--do not link these, as they will just redirect back to news agency--&gt;'''wire service''', '''newswire''', or '''news service'''.

Although there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP), [[Associated Press]] (AP) and [[Reuters]], have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information. All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. [[Jonathan Fenby]] explains the philosophy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises – or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Only a few large newspapers could afford bureaus outside their home city. They relied instead on news agencies, especially [[Havas]] (founded 1835) in France and the [[Associated Press]] (founded 1846) in the United States. Former Havas employees founded [[Reuters Group|Reuters]] in 1851 in Britain and [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] in 1849 in Germany; Havas is now [[Agence France-Presse (AFP)]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; For international news, the agencies pooled their resources, so that Havas, for example, covered the French Empire, South America and the Balkans and shared the news with the other national agencies. In France the typical contract with Havas provided a provincial newspaper with 1800 lines of telegraphed text daily, for an annual subscription rate of 10,000 francs. Other agencies provided features and fiction for their subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France: 1848–1945'' (1977) 2: 538–539&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, France had several specialized agencies. Agence Havas was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and advertising agent, [[Charles-Louis Havas]], to supply news about France to foreign customers. In the 1840s, Havas gradually incorporated other French agencies into his agency. Agence Havas evolved into [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W. Miller |editor= |others= |title=Consider the source: A Critical Guide to 100 Prominent News and Information Sites on the Web |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2007 |publisher=Information Today, Inc. |location= |language= |isbn=0-910965-77-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=1 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his employees, [[Bernhard Wolff]] and [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Reuter]], later set up rival news agencies, [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in 1849 in Berlin and Reuters in 1851 in London. [[Guglielmo Stefani]] founded the [[Agenzia Stefani]], which became the most important press agency in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy from the mid-19th century to World War II]], in [[Turin]] in 1853.

The development of the telegraph in the 1850s led to the creation of strong national agencies in England, Germany, Austria and the United States. But despite the efforts of governments, through telegraph laws such as in 1878 in France, inspired by the British [[Telegraph Act]] of 1869 which paved the way for the nationalisation of telegraph companies and their operations, the cost of telegraphy remained high.

In the United States, the judgment in ''Inter Ocean Publishing v. Associated Press'' facilitated competition by requiring agencies to accept all newspapers wishing to join. As a result of the increasing newspapers, the Associated Press was now challenged by the creation of [[United Press Associations]] in 1907 and [[International News Service]] by newspaper publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1909. Driven by the huge U.S. domestic market, boosted by the runaway success of radio, all three major agencies required the dismantling of the "cartel agencies" through the Agreement of 26 August 1927. They were concerned about the success of U.S. agencies from other European countries which sought to create national agencies after the First World War. Reuters had been weakened by war censorship, which promoted the creation of newspaper cooperatives in the Commonwealth and national agencies in Asia, two of its strong areas. After the Second World War, the movement for the creation of national agencies accelerated, when accessing the independence of former colonies, the national agencies were operated by the State. Reuters, became cooperative, managed a breakthrough in finance, and helped to reduce the number of U.S. agencies from three to one, along with the internationalization of the Spanish [[EFE]] and the globalization of Agence France-Presse.

In 1924, [[Benito Mussolini]] placed Agenzia Stefani under the direction of [[Manlio Morgagni]], who expanded the agency's reach significantly both within Italy and abroad. Agenzia Stefani was dissolved in 1945, and its technical structure and organization were transferred to the new [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]] (ANSA). Wolffs was taken over by the Nazi regime in 1934, and Reuters continues to operate as a major international news agency today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/25/us-reuters-baroness-idUSTRE50O1GV20090125 "Baroness Reuter, last link to news dynasty, dies"], ''Reuters'', January 25, 2009. Retrieved February 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, Reuter and Wolff signed agreements with Havas's sons, forming a cartel designating exclusive reporting zones for each of their agencies within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentalhistory.org/revcomm/timelines/ch7-telegraph/ "Ch 7 Telegraph"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801114401/http://www.environmentalhistory.org/revcomm/timelines/ch7-telegraph/ |date=2013-08-01 }}, ''Revolutions in Communication: Media history from Gutenberg to the digital age'' (2010). Retrieved February 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, the major agencies were provided with new opportunities in television and magazine, and news agencies delivered specialized production of images and photos, the demand for which is constantly increasing. In France, for example, they account for over two-thirds of national market.&lt;ref name="SgDdai"&gt;« Statistiques d’entreprises des industries culturelles », par Valérie Deroin, Secrétariat général Délégation au développement et aux affaires internationales au sein du Département des études, de la prospective et des statistiques [http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/content/.../Cchiffres08_4.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial services==
News agencies can be [[corporations]] that sell news (e.g., [[Press Association]], [[Thomson Reuters]] and [[United Press International]]). Other agencies work cooperatively with large media companies, generating their news centrally and sharing local news stories the major news agencies may choose to pick up and redistribute (i.e., [[Associated Press]] (AP), [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) or American Press Agency (APA)) and Indian Press Agency [[Press Trust of India|PTI]].

Governments may also control news agencies: China ([[Xinhua]]), France ([[Agence France-Presse]]), Russia ([[ITAR-TASS]]), and several other [[countries]] have government-funded news agencies which also use information from other agencies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver, ed. (2010). ''[http://llibreria.gencat.cat/product_info.php?products_id=4585 News Agencies in the Turbulent Era of the Internet]''. Generalitat de Catalunya. {{ISBN|978-84-393-8303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial newswire services charge businesses to distribute their news (e.g., [[Business Wire]], [[Globe Newswire|GlobeNewswire]], [[Marketwire]], [[PR Newswire]], [[PR Web]], and [[Cision|CisionWire]]).

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts, and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

News sources, collectively, described as [[alternative media]] provide reporting which emphasizes a self-defined "non-corporate view" as a contrast to the points of view expressed in [[corporate media]] and government-generated news releases. [[Internet]]-based [[alternative news agency|alternative news agencies]] form one component of these sources.

==Associations==
There are several different associations of news agencies. [[European Alliance of News Agencies|EANA]] is the European Alliance of Press Agencies, while the [[Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies|OANA]] is an association of news agencies of the Asia-Pacific region. [[MINDS International|MINDS]] is a global network of leading news agencies collaborating in new media business.

==Early life==
Irving was born in [[Fort Meade, Maryland]] on the [[United States Army|US Army]] post [[Fort George G. Meade]] growing up the son of two enlisted soldiers.&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/18/how-an-army-rangers-sniper-became-the-reaper/|title=How an Army Rangers sniper became 'The Reaper'|accessdate=April 27, 2016|date=January 18, 2015|first=Kyle|last=Smith|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wasn’t a great student — the only A he ever got was in junior ROTC — and his discipline needed some work.&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;

==Books==
In 2012, Irving wrote and published ''Team Reaper: 33 Kills...4 months''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Team Reaper: 33 Kills...4 months|publisher=[[CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1470022839|location=[[Seattle, Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he wrote and published with Gary Brozek a book about his time in the military fighting the [[War on Terrorism]] called ''The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irving|first1=Nicholas|first2=Gary|last2=Brozek|year=2015|title=The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1250045447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishersweekly.com/978-1-250-04544-7|title=The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers|work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 2015, [[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the television rights to make a [[miniseries]] out of the [[autobiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/406023-the-weinstein-company-plans-five-part-sniper-miniseries-the-reaper|last=Lesnick|title=The Weinstein Company Plans Five-Part Sniper Miniseries The Reaper|work=Coming Soon|accessdate=April 27, 2016|date=February 2, 2015|first=Silas}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2015, [[NBC]] picked up the miniseries from Weinstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/sniper-miniseries-the-reaper-nbc-pickup-weinstein-co-1201386994/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 5, 2015|title=NBC Picks Up Sniper Miniseries ‘The Reaper’ From Weinstein Co.|first=Nellie|accessdate=April 27, 2016|last=Andreeva|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In late 2017 Irving revealed in a podcast that the miniseries has been scrapped, but a movie based on the book was in preproduction.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In May 2018 he published a book called ''Reaper: Ghost Target''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Career==
Irving joined the [[U.S. military]]. Failing a colorblindness test ended the young man's hopes for joining the [[Navy SEALs|SEALs]], but Irving took to life as a [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]]. Before serving in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], he left his wife at [[Fort Benning]]. Irving took an [[SR-25|SR-25 rifle]] with him, calling it ''Dirty Diana''.&lt;ref name="NYPost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/reaper-sniper-nick-irving-killed-5000234|title=The Reaper: US sniper Nick Irving killed 33 enemies in under four months with gun called 'Dirty Diana'|date=January 18, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016|work=|first=Christopher|last=Bucktin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Rangers nicknamed Irving "The Reaper" because of his proficiency for killing.&lt;ref name="The Reaper"/&gt;

After serving his country, he decided to work in television. Irving first served as legal and business affairs associate in ''911: The Bronx'' (TV series [[documentary]] 2008), ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' (2008–10), and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' (2008–11).

'''Performance''' is completion of a task with application of knowledge, skills and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Shields|author2=Michelle Brown|author3=et al.|title=Managing Employee Performance and Reward: Concepts, Practices, Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-4-4115-2|pages=125+}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Management science ==
In work place, performance or job performance means good ranking with the hypothesized conception of requirements of a role. There are two types of job performances: contextual and task. Task performance is related to cognitive ability while contextual performance is dependent upon personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ivan T. Robertson|author2=Cary L. Cooper|title=Personnel Psychology and Human Resources Management: A Reader for Students and Practitioners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5MtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=12 January 2015|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-119-09060-1|pages=24+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Task performance are behavioral roles that are recognized in job descriptions and by remuneration systems, they are directly related to organizational performance, whereas, contextual performance are value based and additional behavioral roles that are not recognized in job descriptions and covered by compensation; they are extra roles that are indirectly related to organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R.

Lance|author3=David J. Woehr|title=Performance Measurement: Current Perspectives and Future Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EunJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-317-82454-1|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonnentag, S &amp; Frese, M. (2009). Dynamic Performance. In S.W.J Kozlowski (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts ==
In the [[performing arts]], a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more [[Work of art|works of art]] to an [[audience]]. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically described as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Music as Play.'' In: Paulo de Assis (ed.), ''Virtual Works – Actual Things: Essays in Musical Ontology.'' Leuven University Press, Leuven 2018 (Orpheus Institute Series), pp. 115–133. [https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/publicaties/virtual-works-actual-things/ pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the performers participate in [[rehearsal]]s beforehand. 

An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994 defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.&lt;ref name="ShippmannAsh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shippmann|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=Ash|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Batjtsta|first3=Mariangela|last4=Carr|first4=Linda|last5=Eyde|first5=Lorraine D.|last6=Hesketh|first6=Beryl|last7=Kehoe|first7=Jerry|last8=Pearlman|first8=Kenneth|last9=Prien|first9=Erich P.|last10=Sanchez|first10=Juan I.|title=THE PRACTICE OF COMPETENCY MODELING|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=53|issue=3|year=2000|pages=703–740|issn=0031-5826|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance may also describe the way in which an [[actor]] performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a [[mime artist]], [[comedian]], [[Evocation|conjurer]], or other entertainer.

== Performance state ==
[[File:Deep Purple - MN Gredos - 01.jpg|thumb|300px|English rock band [[Deep Purple]] performing in [[Hoyos del Espino]], [[Spain]] (2013)]]
Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal performance state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff , G. Gregory|author2=Triplett , N. Travis|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfuXCgAAQBAJ|edition=4th|year=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-1-4925-0162-6|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of [[fear]]
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or [[self-efficacy]]
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve [[automaticity]]. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Landy|author2=Jeffrey M. Conte|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K1rnp9uAscC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9025-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill, even over practice itself can result in failure due to [[ego depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. L., Hardy, T., &amp; Arkin, R. (2009). When practice doesn't make perfect: Effort expenditure as an active behavioral self-handicapping strategy.

Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|issue=1|pages=123–130|pmid=7367532|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2|pmid=24477850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported [[anxiety]] of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclntyre|first1=Valerie|title=Heart Rate Variability as a Predictor of Speaking Anxiety|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2010|volume=27|issue=4|pages=286–297|doi=10.1080/08824096.2010.496323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other physiological responses to public performance include [[perspiration]], secretion of the [[adrenal glands]], and increased blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brutten|first1=Eugene|title=A Palmer Sweat Investigation of the Effect of Audience Variation Upon Stage Fright.|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92–96|doi=10.1080/03637756309375363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieces Project''' is an experimental art/ [[comics]] project. It was initiated in 2006 by a Polish artist Jakub Mazerant.&lt;ref&gt;Pieces Project official website http://www.piecesbooks.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces Project involves various artists working on one [[comic book]]. Each artist creates only one panel ("piece") of the story. There is no script provided. The story evolves with each and every panel.

'''Pieces Project - first edition'''

The first edition lasted from 2006 until 2010. 94 international artists contributed to the first edition of the project. The countries involved included: Poland, Japan, USA, Belgium, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Argentina, Sweden, France, Chile, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Lithuania. The first edition of the Pieces Project was released in a printed form. 
The "Pieces Project - Pieces Book 1" set an official '''[[Guinness World Record]]''' in October 2013&lt;ref&gt;IllustrateYourself.com Gallery website http://illustrateyourself.com/news/entry/pieces-project-pieces-book-1-guinness-world-record&lt;/ref&gt; in "The most contributors to a published comic book" category.&lt;ref&gt;Culture.pl http://culture.pl/en/article/guinness-world-record-winning-comic&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieces - Project - second edition'''

The second edition was initiated in 2012. This edition is still in progress. There have been almost 100 artists involved.

'''Pieces Project exhibition'''

Both editions of the project were presented during the International Festival of Comics and Games in Lodz (Poland) in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;International Festival of Comics and Games official website http://komiksfestiwal.com/en/comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical cheerleading''' is a performative style of political activism, derived from mainstream [[cheerleading]]. Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or [[non-violent direct action]] with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara, Aimee and Colleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, in 1996.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and Europe. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt [[Cheering|cheers]] that promote [[feminism]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;ots=h1VYipd5FH&amp;dq=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=Grindstaff|first=Laura Anne|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-0916-7|location=Los Angeles|page=126|chapter=Cheerleading: The Gender Politics of Contemporary Cheerleading}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Subculture ==
Over time, radical cheerleading developed into a subculture apart from [[cheerleading]]. To understand how radical cheerleading became a culture of its own, it is important to consider the impacts of mainstream cheerleading.

Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. Still, cheerleaders were (and often still are) consistently stereotyped as unintelligent, ditzy, and promiscuous, as opposed to true athletes. Regular cheerleaders are often hypersexualized and defined by an idealized female body type. Author Christine Ro writes, "the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/hey-hey-ho-ho-where-did-radical-cheerleaders-go|title=HEY HEY! HO HO! WHERE DID RADICAL CHEERLEADERS GO?|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=August 10, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical cheerleaders reclaimed the identity of the cheerleader and re-shaped mainstream cheerleading to include all bodies, as opposed to certain bodies. They transformed cheerleading from a sideshow into the main event. They shifted the focus of cheerleading from sexualized spectacle to the promotion of larger ideas, like civilian empowerment and political awareness. In these ways, radical cheerleading developed into a distinct culture of its own.

== Gender non-conformity ==
Mainstream cheerleading is marked by heteronormativity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In contrast, gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, [[transgender]], non-binary or non-gender identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncXeMQUMtPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=usJqypZj99&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Cheerleader!: An American Icon|last=Adams|first=Natalie Guice|last2=Bettis|first2=Pamela|publisher=Palgrave|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6184-6|location=New York|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for "cultivating a queer sensibility."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The subculture’s inclusion of non-gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts.
[[File:Radical cheerleaders at climate change action.jpg|thumb]]

== Aesthetics ==
Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make [[Pom-pom|pom-poms]] using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. 

Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/were-here-we-cheer-get-used-it-136589|title=We're Here!

== Notable demonstrations ==
[[File:S15 Radical Cheerleading 1.jpg|thumb]]
Radical cheerleaders often perform at political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR5uGYkTj5UC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=HVwsoN399_&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Media and Politics of Resistance: A Communication Perspective|last=Atkinson|first=Joshua D.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0517-3|location=New York|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people-friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. Chicago's Lickity Split radical cheerleaders frequently used this tactic.

A notable radical cheerleading appearance was at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in [[Washington, DC]] on April 25, 2004. The participants' aim was to raise awareness about the lack of access low-income women have to [[abortion]] clinics.

Another remarkable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the "Taco Bell Protest," participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gimme-an-a-6323520|title=Gimme an A!|last=Roe|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2001|work=Broward Palm Beach New Times|access-date=April 2, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taco Bell Protest serves as an encapsulating example of all that radical cheerleading stands for: peaceful (if not disruptive) demonstration, DIY construction of protest tools/props, an anti-capitalist agenda, and a demand for fair wages, a classic feminist ideal. 

Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cheer content ==
Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York:

{{Quote|Sound off! I don’t wanna work anymore! What did you say? I said the system doesn’t work anymore! What did you say? I said STOMP, smash the state, Let's liberate, Acknowledge me or go to hell, another womyn to rebel, let's liberate, Stomp, smash the state, let's liberate, organize and raise some hell, act up, unite and rebel!&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;}}

An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: "We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media ==
While the subculture has received some attention from the media, radical cheerleading receives less media attention than mainstream cheerleading.

In ''Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance'', radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|title=Give Me an F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance|last=Vaccaro|first=Jeanne|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120655/https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director [[Lisa Jervis]] placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed ''Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up'', a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of ''American Cheerleader'' magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an "uphill battle" towards gaining respect,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is "all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W. R. Burnett]]'s novel, ''Goodbye to the Past'' (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David (April 2006). ''The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K.

[[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A.

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S.

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RollerGames logo.png|right|200px]]
[[Image:World Alliance of Rollersports logo.png|right|150px|thumb|'''World Alliance of Rollersports''' (fictional league for ''RollerGames'')]]

'''''RollerGames''''' was a U.S. television series that presented a theatrical version of the sport of [[roller derby]] for a national audience, and featured a number of skaters who had been in the [[Roller Games]] league (1961–1975), as well as younger participants. It was broadcast for one season (1989–1990).  The series came from the combination of Roller Games owner William Griffiths, Sr. and the television production team of David Sams and [[Mike Miller (TV producer)|Mike Miller]]. 

==Format==
The show took place in the [[Super Roller Dome]], where all matches were broadcast. Instead of a banked oval track, a [[Figure 8 racing|figure eight]] track was used where one side was heavily banked. It included obstacles such as the "Wall of Death" (which was located on the heavily banked side) and the "Jet Jump". The only ones who could score during each 45-second scoring [[Frequency|cycle]] were the "jetters," who wore helmets and got six points if they got above the top line for three steps on the Wall of Death without going over, and two points if they got between the two lines for three steps.  The "Jet Jump" had a 12-foot marker that allowed six points if the jetter got past it, and two if the jetter landed in front of it. In either case, the jetter had to land safely.  Also, there were only four skaters on the track at a time (instead of the usual five). 

The rest of the cycle involved traditional roller derby elements of scoring one point for every opponent lapped.  The players got as many 45-second cycles as possible within four six-minute periods (cut down from eight 12-minute periods in traditional roller derby).  The team with the most points won.  The last cycle went the full 45 seconds regardless of what the period clock said.

The first jetter to legally enter the jetwave won the status of "lead jetter," and could cut off the cycle early by tapping his or her helmet, signaling the referees to call off the cycle.

As a [[tiebreaker]], two skaters would skate around a pit full of [[alligator]]s. The first skater to skate around the pit five times or to throw his or her opponent into the alligator pit was declared the winner.  The debut episode was the only time live alligators were ever used, as no ties ever happened after that (although a "news report" featured another tiebreaker).  The episode revealed one of the rare times that the T-Birds lost the championship, with the Violators taking it (although later footage revealed that Skull, the manager, cheated by interfering, but the Violators got to keep the Commissioner's Cup in spite of that).

Instead of a [[penalty box]], skaters that committed misdemeanors sat in a "penalty pod," one of each was located on either side of the broadcast booth where Sams and Underwood called the action.  Because the rules said there were always four skaters on the track, a jetter got one bonus point each time they passed the skater inside the pod.  Referee [[Don Lastra]] frequently referred to the penalty pod as "jail," and would tell skaters who got a penalty to "go sit down."  (Lastra would also fine players specific amounts of money; these fines were to be paid out of pocket as a check and given to him, since he issued the fines.  Fines usually were issued if the act incurring a penalty came in between a period or after the end of the game, but the players who got fined always said vindication was theirs, and thus a [[moral victory]] was earned).

==Teams ==
The "world famous" [[Los Angeles T-Birds]] were one of the teams used for the show. Other teams were the Rockers, Hot Flash, Violators, Bad Attitude and Maniacs. Many of the athletes that skated for Griffiths in the past were used for ''RollerGames''. (The Hot Flash team was referred as "Hollywood Hot Flash" on a couple of occasions.)  Some of the most visible skaters included twin sisters [[Jennifer Van Galder|Jennifer]] &amp; [[Kristine Van Galder]], the "T-Bird Twins" (two blonde waitresses that Sams recruited while dining at a trendy LA area eatery), "The IceBox" Robert Smith, brothers "Mr. Mean" Harold Jackson &amp; "Monster Man" Bernie Jackson, Michael Flaningam "The California Kid", "Skinney Minnie" Gwen Miller, "Electric" Randi Whitman (who got her nickname because of her hair), "Stars and Stripes" Matt Bickham, "Dar The Star" Darlene Langlois, "Latin Spitfire" Patsy Delgado, "Sweet" Stephanie Garcia, and Rocker Speed Skater and Guitarist on the Roller Games TV Theme Song, Michael "Fish" Fischer (who was forced to leave the team before the first telecast because he broke his hand in practice), and [[Ralphie Valladares]], whose daughter, Gina, skated for Hot Flash. Other past Roller Derby personalities to appear on ''RollerGames'' included "Mizz" [[Georgia Hase]], the cantankerous heel manager of the Detroit Devils and Bad Attitude, and "Little" Richard Brown, the Maniacs' top skater who got to manage and coach several skaters on ''[[RollerJam]]''.

== Storylines ==
Some of the storylines were off-the-wall, but tame by today's standards&amp;nbsp;— the main storyline was a controversy involving the T-Bird Twins being drafted as one person (more on that below), rather than two.  Hair-pulling and catfights were crowd favorites.  When a fight broke out, the cameras frequently cut to a shot of an angry woman in a pink dress, glaring at the skaters.

The show became noted for its "big controversy:" according to a report from Sams, Georgia Hase claimed the T-Bird Twins were improperly drafted as one entity.  Thus, Jennifer went to the Violaters, and Kristine went to the Maniacs. At the same time, the league office informed Ralphie Valladares that he was to be the first inductee into the Hall of Fame.  This led Hase to object that, according to the rule book, Ralphie could not enter unless he hung up his skates for good. The league office did not intend for that to happen.  Hase then decided that Ralphie would never skate again, as well as never go into the Hall of Fame.

After two rule violations by [[John "Guru" Drew]] (manager for the Maniacs) and [[Chuck Skull]] (manager of the Violators) of physically abusing each of the T-Bird twins, Sams and on-the-track commentator [[Shelley Jamison]] brought up how each twin's contract was null and void, thus returning them to the T-Birds.  This led Griffiths, Sr., as commissioner, to let the public decide on how this situation was to go.  The American public overwhelmingly elected that Ralphie continue to skate while being inducted into the Hall of Fame, and that the twins return to the T-Birds for good (viewers in the continental 48 states could vote by calling a 900 number, while Alaska and Hawaii residents had to write a letter to a specific address, as the 900 number was not available to them).  The exact number of votes was 75,468, with 96% voting "YES" and only 4% voting "NO."

Although the show was cancelled after one season, the show also featured an episode where Ralphie challenged the "unholy 3" ("Mizz" Georgia Hase, Guru Drew, Skull) to a 3-on-1 match race. Griffiths, Sr. pointed out that 3-on-1 wasn't legal according to league laws (during an interview with [[Wally George]]), but 2-on-1 was, so Skull had to drop out.  While Ralphie dealt with Georgia and Drew, "Stars and Stripes" Matt Bickham reported to Shelley Jamison that he'd keep an eye on Skull.  Due to the producers' bankruptcy and the show's subsequent cancellation, that match race never took place.  The show also offered the public a chance to dial the same 900 number and vote on whether or not the alligators should be banned from the sport, but due to the cancellation, the viewers never got to see the outcome.

== Production ==
In 1989, television producers David Sams and [[Mike Miller (television)|Mike Miller]] teamed with Roller Games owner Bill Griffiths, Sr. to create a modern version of the sport marketed as ''Rock and RollerGames''. Sams provided color commentary while [[Chuck Underwood]] provided the main play-by-play.

The show also included halftime entertainment by musical performers like [[Lita Ford]], [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]], [[Exposé (band)|Exposé]], and had halftime commentary by [[Wally George]]. Former [[Phoenix, Arizona]] news reporter [[Shelley Jamison|Shelly Jamison]] (who also appeared nude in ''[[Playboy]]'') served as sideline reporter. ''RollerGames'' premiered in 95% of the country, and, though generally panned by critics, was well received among teenagers and college students.{{fact|date=May 2010}}

Director [[Chet Forte]] was recruited to direct the show. Many of the graphics and camera techniques were unique for the day, like the cameras on the skaters.  Additional segments were directed by producer David Sams, [[Joe Dea]] and wrestling director [[Andrew Hecker]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443402/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In many cities, ''RollerGames'' aired late at night, against ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', while in others it aired mid-day on Saturdays. Although the show's ratings were quite good, even beating out ''[[American Gladiators]]'', it only lasted one season before getting cancelled due to some of the producers going [[bankrupt]] (War Productions, Sans-Miller Productions). However, co-producers Motown Productions, and the distributor, [[Qintex| Qintex Productions]] (who also co-produced the Disney Channel's version of ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' for two seasons) did not go bankrupt due to ''RollerGames''.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} RollerGames delivered a 4.7 national rating vs. the ''American Gladiators'' 2.5 rating. Its debut in New York scored a 9.3 overnight rating.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Revivals==
The show paved the way for a revival ten years later with the 1999 premiere of [[Spike TV|The New TNN]]'s ''[[WSL RollerJam]]'', where former ''RollerGames'' skaters Richard Brown, Patsy Delgado and Ray Robles skated.

In January 2008, ''RollerGames'' coproducer David Sams announced that he "intends to put banked-track Roller Sports back on Television and the Internet in 2008."&lt;!--Actual ref is a MySpace blog, but blog.myspace.com is blacklisted on Wikipedia--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17725020&amp;blogID=348468694

He also said "A tour is being planned for the winter/spring of 2009."&lt;!--Actual ref is a MySpace blog, but blog.myspace.com is blacklisted on Wikipedia--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=17725020&amp;blogID=371481808|title=Sams Looking For The Best Roller Derby Players In America To Star In PrimeTime TV Series...|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''RollerGames'', Griffiths continued promoting an untelevised league under the name [[Roller Games International]], which continues the sport of ''RollerGames'' to this day.

'''''S-Town''''' is an investigative journalism [[podcast]] hosted by Brian Reed and created by the producers of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' and ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|last1=Locke|first1=Charley|title=The Creators of ‘Serial’ Are Back With ‘S-Town,’ a Binge-Ready New Podcast|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/s-town-podcast/|website=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seven chapters were released on March 28, 2017. The podcast was downloaded a record-breaking 10 million times in four days,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rob, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/new-podcast-from-serial-makers-stown-breaks-download-records-20170402-gvc4l2.html "New podcast from Serial makers, S-Town, breaks download records"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', April 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and it had been downloaded over 40 million times by May of 2017.

==Synopsis==
In 2012, antiquarian [[Horology|horologist]] John B. McLemore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Woodstock man at the center of "S-Town" podcast|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20170328/woodstock-man-at-center-of-s-town-podcast|website=tuscaloosanews.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sent an email to the staff of the show ''This American Life'' asking them to investigate an alleged murder in his hometown of [[Woodstock, Alabama]], a place McLemore claimed to despise. After a year of exchanging emails, and several months of conversation with McLemore, producer Brian Reed traveled to Woodstock to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dibdin|first1=Emma|title=How The Serial Team's New Podcast S-Town Evolved From True Crime Into Human Tragedy|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a54090/shittown-podcast-interview-julie-snyder/|website=Esquire|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed investigated the crime, and eventually found that no such murder took place, though he struck up a friendship with the depressed but colorful character of McLemore. He recorded conversations with McLemore and other people in Woodstock, which are played on the podcast.

McLemore killed himself by drinking [[potassium cyanide]] on June 22, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John B.

In the narrative of the podcast, this occurs at the end of the second episode; subsequent episodes deal with the fallout from McLemore's death while exploring more of McLemore's life and character.

==Title==
Though the podcast was promoted under the name ''S-Town'', Reed reveals in the first episode that this is a euphemism for "Shittown," John B. McLemore's derogatory term for his hometown of [[Woodstock, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Reed generally refers to the podcast by the non-euphemized name in the episodes themselves.

 |ShortSummary= After more than a year of correspondence, investigative journalist Brian Reed visits John B. McLemore’s small hometown Woodstock, Alabama after John’s request that he investigate the murder and cover up of a young man named Dylan Nichols. John informs Brian that Kabrahm Burt bragged to an acquaintance named Jake Goodson that he had killed Dylan. After many failed attempts to speak to Jake Goodson, Brian begins to suspect that John is hiding something. Brian also meets Jake's brother Tyler, who does work for John and is very good friends with him. After days of searching for evidence with no results, Jake’s wife Skylar drops by John’s on a whim and finally confirms that she was there when Kabrahm admitted to killing Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;https://stownpodcast.org/chapter/1&lt;/ref&gt; |LineColor=A62821

 |ShortSummary= Brian begins to question the validity of the murder, he goes around probing for more answers from the people of S-town only to find that they are fixed to the idea. Uncertain about directly confronting Kabrahm, he speaks with Tyler, tattoo artist Bubba and other locals to learn a bit more about John. Finally, Brian seeks out Kabrahm to hear from the suspected murderer firsthand, however, he discovers that the murder was completely fabricated. John explains his discontent with the indifference of the people in S-town. A couple of weeks after this discussion, Skylar calls Brian informing him that John committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;https://stownpodcast.org/chapter/2&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary= While clearly shocked about John's death, Brian admits that John had discussed committing suicide before, usually in relation to his obsession with [[Ecological collapse|ecological]] and [[Economic collapse|economic]] collapse. Brian returns to Alabama to attend John's funeral and meets Tyler, who informs Brian that he and John had a falling out the day before his suicide. John's mother Mary Grace is taken in by John's cousin Reta and her husband, which Tyler believes is an attempt to get to her and John's assets. Further complicating things is the fact that John intended to leave his assets to Tyler, including a rumored stash of gold, but John didn't leave a will, meaning Tyler has no legal right to claim them. Tyler claims he will take the cousins to court and if that doesn't work, he'll take matters into his own hands.

==Further developments==
Shortly after the release of the podcast, John's online obituary was flooded with support and shared reflections from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/john-mclemore-obituary?pid=1000000175165387|title=John McLemore Obituary&amp;nbsp;– Bessemer, Alabama|last=admin|date=2015-06-26|website=Legacy.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2017 interview, Tyler Goodson said that he sometimes regrets "ever speaking into that microphone because [he] was probably upset, or wasn't thinking clearly" since he faced trial for the criminal actions that were described in the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/arts/s-town-arrest-tyler-goodson.html|title=Tyler Goodson of ‘S-Town’ Accused of Killing Brother’s Dog |last=Fortin|first=Jacey|date=2017-06-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-21| last2=Salam|first2=Maya|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Goodson pleaded guilty to the burglaries that were described in the podcast, and he will serve five years on probation with a ten-year [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/16/s-town-podcast-tyler-goodson-pleads-guilty-burglary|title= S-Town's Tyler Goodson pleads guilty to charges tied to events in podcast |publisher=The Guardian|access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Unbalanced section|date=October 2018}}
''S-Town'' was culturally popular and received mixed{{Disputed inline|Reviews only mixed?|date=February 2018}} critical reviews. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'s}} [[Ty Burr]] thought the show was complex and voyeuristic. He asked the question "is ''S-Town'' a freak show for the NPR crowd?" and described the series as "seven chapters of provocative [[red herring]]s that almost but never quite add up to a place, a people, or a man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burr |first=Ty |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2017/04/17/town-art-exploitation-complicated/7kW0hf0v2XA0chPRsNufPI/story.html |title=Is ‘S-Town’ art or exploitation? It’s complicated. |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2017-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Goudeau from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' questioned the ethics of the series, asking "is it okay to confess another person's pain for the sake of a good story?".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/04/was-the-art-of-s-town-worth-the-pain/522366/|title=Was the Art of S-Town Worth the Pain?|last=Goudeau|first=Jessica|date=2017-04-09|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goudeau also wondered how [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Robert Lowell]], or [[Elizabeth Bishop]] would have reacted to the podcast and the exploration of poor, white, rural America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'s}} Katy Waldman wrote that ''S-Town'' feels more like a new genre, "something more like aural literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waldman |first=Katy |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/03/30/s_town_the_new_true_crime_podcast_by_the_makers_of_serial_reviewed.html |title=The Gorgeous New True Crime Podcast S-Town Is Like Serial but Satisfying |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=2017-03-31 |accessdate=2017-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vox (website)|''Vox'']]'s Aja Romano called the podcast "stunning", but suggested the podcast was too invasive and should not have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/30/15084224/s-town-review-controversial-podcast-privacy|title=S-Town is a stunning podcast.

The podcast's critics claimed that the studio took advantage of John's death in order to gain publicity. ''Crixeo'', an online arts monthly, argues that Reed did not have the right to publicly out John as [[queer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crixeo.com/s-town-ethics/|title=‘S-Town’ and the Ethics of Storytelling&amp;nbsp;– Crixeo|date=2017-05-29|work=Crixeo|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other views contend that ''S-Town'' was a way for them to take the story of John's death and shed light on mental health in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/depression/s-town-john-mclemore|title=7 Ways 'S-Town' Showed How Devastating Mental Illness Can Be|work=Health.com|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'''s Spencer Kornhaber praised the series for its journalism, and humanism, as the series "hints at the possibility of cultural reconciliation" within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/s-town-podcast-review-empathy-cultural-divides/521325/|title='S-Town' Is a Monument to Human Empathy|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Nicholson from ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the series "a noble attempt at understanding life", as the series showed "the great hope that resides within", by showing a person trying to survive within their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/03/s-town-review-its-hard-to-recall-a-more-touching-devastating-podcast-serial-john-b-mclemore-brian-reed|title=S-Town review – it’s hard to recall a more touching, devastating podcast|last=Nicholson|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' gave ''S-Town'' a critical review. The opinion piece called S-town “a good story, but an indefensible one.” The article states that the podcast is supposed to leave you feeling positive, however instead it feels forced. The author feels that the podcast doesn’t fully addressed the main quandary at the center of S-town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/22/s-town-never-justifies-its-voyeurism-and-that-makes-it-morally-indefensible |first=Gay |last=Alcorn |title=S-Town never justifies its voyeurism, and that makes it morally indefensible |work=The Guardian |date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2017, the podcast series was downloaded over 40 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Quah|first=v|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/s-town-podcast-40-million-downloads.html|title=S-Town Has Exceeded 40M Downloads, Which Is Truly a Ton of Downloads|date=2017-05-04 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It retained a high ranking in the iTunes chart and continued to be analysed in the press well into 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=SALAM|first1=MAYA|title=Can’t Let Go of ‘S-Town’?

Considered a difficult film to label while still managing to develop something of a [[Cult film|cult]] following throughout the years nonetheless, it was shot in a bizarre manner somewhat resembling [[film noir]] or neo-noir and black comedy as well as the [[exploitation film|exploitation]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and crime genres mixed with some elements of eroticism and [[horror film|horror]] with sex being used as a power game and received a theatrical release in Greece on 6 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hardy|editor-first=Phil|editor-link=Phil Hardy (journalist)|year=1995|title=The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror|title-link=The Aurum Film Encyclopedia|volume=3|publisher=New York, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]|pages=478–479|isbn=0-87951-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/08/25/review-singapore-sling-a-man-in-love-with-a-corpse/|title=Review: ''Singapore Sling'' – A Man in Love with a Corpse|website=The Dreamin' Demon: Real Life Horror (Reviews: S)|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Nikolaidis' career as a film director in his home country which stretches to the early 1960s he was almost entirely unknown outside Greece before the early 1990s and is still less known outside it and it was only with this film, which has immediately achieved cult status, that international fame came to him and it probably still remains the film for which he is best known today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/06/22/singapore-sling-18-207547/|title=''Singapore Sling'' (18)|last=Rudd|first=Amy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=22 June 2008|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exemplified by the fact that it was released on DVD by [[Synapse Films]], the only one of Nikolaidis' films to so far receive a home video release in North America. The film was officially selected for screening at the Rimini Film Festival.

==Plot==
Two mentally ill women who are clearly suffering from not otherwise specified delusional disorders, a mother and a (grown) daughter, live together in a secluded mansion. They are in a relationship and both are recognised for their beauty. They spend their days playing perverse [[BDSM]]-related incestuous games in memory of their [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] patriarch who, when he was still alive, raped his daughter when she was eleven, murdered several servants, and is now a mummified corpse with which the daughter is shown having sex. They occasionally kill their servants and bury their bodies in the garden.

When first glimpsed the psychotic mother-daughter protagonists, half-dressed, are burying their disemboweled chauffeur into a pit, they have just finished to dig in their backyard on a dark and stormy night with thunder and heavy rain. They lay down their shovels and drag out of the bushes, his fresh corpse. He was killed in one of their usual games combining incestuous sex with murder. Shortly after this and at first unnoticed by the two women, a lovesick detective pulls his car up to the residence. He is suffering from a painful bullet wound and an equally painful yearning to track down Laura, his long-missing beloved for whom he has been searching for three years and about whom it is known that she has visited the area. What he does not yet know is that he has stumbled onto the lair of two profoundly insane women who have already lured Laura into their home and brutally killed her (in the process decorating their kitchen with her viscera, as a flashback helpfully shows). It is also revealed that the daughter is physically very similar to Laura and is desperately looking for a man's companionship. 

The duo then easily take the seriously wounded and bleeding detective, having already figured them out to be responsible for Laura's kidnapping, into their home, essentially kidnapping him. As the exhausted detective was silent and apparently refuses to speak, even in order to state his own name, the two women christen him 'Singapore Sling', after they discover a recipe in his pocket notebook for that type of [[Singapore Sling|cocktail]]. They use him as a pawn in their sexually tinged [[Sexual roleplay|role-playing games]] and as a party to their distorted and perverse form of entertainment, during which Singapore Sling, now a prisoner, is tied up, chained to a bed, vomited on, electrocuted, used as a sex slave, and subjected to various other forms of torture and atrocities in which he is forced to participate. However, as Singapore Sling's confinement wears on he regains his strength and takes a more active role in the games. His deranged captors become concerned and alarmed when a sharp kitchen knife, belonging to the late father, goes missing and they discover Singapore Sling digging a deep hole in their backyard. As psychotic as these two are, they are still lucid enough to recognize that a killing is imminent, if not two or even three. In an atmosphere of decadence and dark madness, the characters gradually sink into the depths of their subconscious mind.

A few days later, the daughter decides that she is fed up with having to suffer under the yoke of maternal authority, and, together with Singapore Sling, murders her mother. Singapore Sling then takes what up until now used to be the mother's role in the sexual games. However, during one of these games, a reenactment of Laura's murder, he stabs the daughter, playing Laura, with the aforementioned missing kitchen knife now attached to his penis. The daughter, while bleeding to death, shoots Singapore Sling and then he goes out to the garden and falls into the pit which he himself had recently dug. The film hence ends, in short, with all three characters dead.

==Themes==
The film's protagonist's search for a woman named Laura is a direct reference to the classic [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) by American director [[Otto Preminger]]. The film uses as background music, in addition to classical music by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], the compositions used by [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Julie London]] in ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).

==Reception==
Director [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] said the following about this film's reception during an interview: "When I was shooting ''Singapore Sling'', I was under the impression that I was making a comedy with elements taken from Ancient Greek Tragedy... Later, when some European and American critics characterized it as 'one of the most disturbing films of all times,' I started to feel that something was wrong with me. Then, when British censors banned its release in England, I finally realized that something is wrong with all of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cult-cinema.ru/reviews/s/singapore_sling/|script-title=ru:''Singapore Sling''/''Сингапурский Слинг'' (1990)|last=Меренков|first=Сергей|date=21 December 2007|website=CULT Cinema: Рецензин, S|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic neo-psychedelia band [[Singapore Sling (band)|Singapore Sling]] is named after the film. As the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson explained in a June 2003 interview with Belgium's [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: "We had a first gig. It was booked and we didn't have a name and I had been looking for a film called ''Singapore Sling'' for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere. It sounded cool, so that became the name of the band. It's some kind of dark, perverse [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] film from 1990. I haven't found it yet, so if you know someone who has it, please let me know. I hope it's good. A dark perverse noir film and a guy who has sex with a corpse. And he's called Singapore Sling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cucamonga.be/interviews/SingaporeSling0603.htm|title=Singapore Sling – ''The Curse of Singapore Sling''|date=16 June 2003|website=Cucamonga Fansite/[[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: Interviews, S|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921123939/http://www.cucamonga.be/interviews/SingaporeSling0603.htm|archivedate=21 September 2005|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, after the completion of his last film ''[[The Zero Years]]'', a tale of [[perversion]] and [[dominance and submission|sexual dominance]] which failed to replicate the earlier success of ''Singapore Sling'', Nikolaidis declared his intention to stop making movies in order to deal with music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemainfo.gr/directors/interviews/nikosnikolaidis/index.html|script-title=el:Κουράστηκα να κάνω ταινίες: Μια συνέντευξη σε πρώτο ενικό.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14614">'''Sports Phone''' was a telephone service in the United States that allowed users to hear sports scores and information. The service was launched in 1972, and after initially failing it was relaunched three years later. The service gained a following, and by 1981 had hit a peak of 50 million calls in a year. Sports Phone began in New York City, but expanded to offer programming in numerous other locations, including Chicago and Detroit. The rise of [[sports radio]] stations and [[News ticker|score tickers]] on television broadcasts helped reduce the popularity of Sports Phone, before an increase in Internet usage led to its demise in 2000.

Callers to Sports Phone heard messages of one minute or less, with up to 30 scores provided in a given update. In addition to scores, the service's programming included news and interviews, along with a sports trivia game. Some information was recorded specifically for certain markets. The announcers for Sports Phone included future broadcasters of several franchises in the major U.S. sports leagues.

==History==
Sports Phone was first introduced on November 1, 1972, after a month of service testing. The original owner was [[New York Telephone]] employee Jack Goodfellow. Customers were charged 10 cents per one-minute phone call, with New York Telephone the recipient of all charges and a fee from Sports Phone for each call. Goodfellow's intention was for the service to make money from advertisements included with the service's updates, but the business model proved unsuccessful. In 1973, Air Time Inc., a media entity, purchased rights to the service. New York Telephone later allowed for information service operators to retain part of the call fees, and Sports Phone was relaunched in 1975.&lt;ref name="thing"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLessio|first=Joe|title=That Was a Thing: Sports Phone, the 1980s Way to Get Real-Time Scores|publisher=Grantland|date=February 24, 2015|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/that-was-a-thing-sports-phone-the-1980s-way-to-get-real-time-scores/|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service used multiple telephone numbers, including at least one alternate number, but the most well-known was 976-1313. Future broadcaster John Giannone claimed that, among New York City sports enthusiasts, "Everyone 45 and over can recite" the number.&lt;ref name="call"&gt;{{cite news|last=Best|first=Neil|title=Remembering Sports Phone and 976-1313: When sports info was a phone call away|work=Newsday|date=July 31, 2015|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/media/remembering-sports-phone-and-976-1313-when-sports-info-was-a-phone-call-away-1.10695116|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, Sports Phone was receiving an average of 65,000 calls daily. It appealed strongly to sports bettors, as it allowed users to access updates on games from the West Coast of the U.S., which frequently ended after broadcasts of television news programs.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service experienced a record period of activity in 1977, as the [[New York Mets]] were completing a trade with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in which [[Tom Seaver]] was sent to the Reds. Sports Phone had 600,000 callers over a three-day span.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{cite news|last=Calabria|first=Pat|title=Sports Phone does big business|work=The Bulletin|date=July 25, 1982|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19820725&amp;id=BpxTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5IYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3735,3747590|page=D3|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in Sports Phone's usage continued in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Daily call figures moved up to around 100,000 in 1979, with peaks of three times that figure on some weekend days when college or pro football games were being held.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; By 1981, New York Telephone was making $3&amp;nbsp;million from Sports Phone over a year; 50 million calls were made to Sports Phone that year; the only Dial-it service that received more activity was the one for [[off-track betting]].&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; The service expanded to markets outside New York City as well. In 1977, Sports Phone introduced a line with updates that focused on Chicago; two years later, Detroit received its own line.&lt;ref name="line"&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Jack|title=Sports Phone on Line: Please Deposit 50 Cents|work=The Boston Globe|date=June 26, 1988|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey and Buffalo were later added as markets with their own numbers.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Daily call numbers in Chicago had hit around 65,000 by 1984, although they reportedly peaked at 175,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brogan|first=Dan|title=C'mon, ring their bell: Knowing the scores is Sports Phone's calling|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 19, 1984|page=E14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports Phone had competition in the field by 1983, as a three-year-old national rival service, Dial-It, was receiving approximately 350,000 calls weekly.&lt;ref name="score"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Lidz|first=Franz|title=If You Don't Know the Score, Sports Phone Services Will Give it to You|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=April 25, 1983|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1983/04/25/643779/if-you-dont-know-the-score-sports-phone-services-will-give-it-to-you|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, Sports Phone's business model had changed, as its parent company, Phone Programs, was earning 2 cents per call from New York Telephone and making more than $1&amp;nbsp;million in revenue; this replaced a previous model in which Sports Phone received payments from [[AT&amp;T]] before the [[breakup of the Bell System]]. Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans had updates that were aimed at those markets by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Blauner|first=Peter|title=Sports Fix|magazine=New York|date=January 7, 1985|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17YBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls to Sports Phone numbers cost 50 cents by 1986. The service was facing increasing competition nationally from providers such as JD's National Score Phone, Dial Sports, and a line from ''[[USA Today]]''. Sports Phone indicated that it planned to increase call lengths to 90 seconds following the beginning of the football schedule; this matched the time of Dial Sports' calls, which cost customers 10 cents less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wernie|first=Bradford|title=Sports Phone Services Score With Results-Hungry Fans|work=Crain's Detroit Business|date=August 11, 1986|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radio station dedicated to [[Sports radio|sports programming]], [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], debuted in New York City in 1987. The initial concept for the station included score updates every 15 minutes, which were inspired by Sports Phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Alex|last2=Kahn|first2=Howie|title=The Sound and the Fury|publisher=Grantland|date=July 11, 2012|url=http://grantland.com/features/don-imus-mike-mad-dog-fall-rise-first-all-sports-talk-station-wfan/|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFAN positioned itself to compete against Sports Phone for the attention of the service's callers. One of the station's first promotional advertisements contained the line "We just made Sports Phone old news."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Sports Phone employee Cory Eisner said, "We knew right away (WFAN) was going to come after us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; At the same time that sports radio was reducing the service's business, it was affected by an increase in the use of [[pager]]s by sports bettors and a rise in number blocks by businesses in the New York City region.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Television stations also moved to provide scores to viewers, as both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] added periodic score updates to their pro football telecasts.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt;

A Boston-area number was introduced in 1988, to coincide with the [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks]] heavyweight championship fight. Services were also provided to the Cleveland and Phoenix markets, but proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt; By 1990, Sports Phone had received nearly one billion calls over the service's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kanner|first=Bernice|title=Hot Lines|magazine=New York|date=September 24, 1990|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmeBLxJqbN8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, though, cable television sports stations were providing score updates. In future years, the Internet would offer scores and news in real time. Caller activity at Sports Phone fell to 1,000 or less daily. The service's last general manager, radio broadcaster [[Don La Greca]], said of Sports Phone's decline, "Technology that helped us update then became available to the general public, and so there was no reason to have us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service was shut down in 2000.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

==Programming==
In the earliest incarnation of Sports Phone, each one-minute call allowed the caller to hear 46 seconds of sports scores. The remaining 14 seconds of the call were taken up by two commercials, each of which lasted seven seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; When the service was reintroduced in 1975, the length of a call fell to between 57 and 58 seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; The reduction in time allowed customers to hang up within 60 seconds, the length of a message unit as defined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="score"/&gt; Recordings were not extended in cases when the announcers had not finished reciting scores; as many as 30 game scores could be fit into the required time frame. Updated score readings were usually done approximately once every 10 to 15 minutes through the conclusion of a night's sports events.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; For Sundays in which pro football was being played, the rate was much quicker, with just two minutes between updates. Sports Phone announcers initially received scores through [[ticker tape]], but later placed employees in press boxes at events for quicker reporting times.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Reporters who cooperated with Sports Phone by providing updates were paid at a rate of $20 per night; alternatively, staffers at Sports Phone would place calls into press boxes seeking updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Employees also sought to record interviews with players, which were incorporated in Sports Phone's updates. Some interviews were recorded on-site, while others were done by announcers at the service's headquarters; the latter approach was used in 1976 by [[Howie Rose]], who interviewed hockey player [[Darryl Sittler]] after he had posted a 10-point game.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; 

Sports Phone had various kinds of filler programming that it aired during days, when there were generally fewer sporting events to report on than nights. In the beginning, updates in the daytime were recorded less frequently than during the night, at 30-minute intervals. Along with updates on baseball games that were in progress, announcers incorporated news and editorial content, in addition to interviews.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; During the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]], when Sports Phone was suffering from a lack of content, the service reported the results of a fictional best-of-seven series between the [[1961 New York Yankees season|1961 New York Yankees]] and [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 New York Mets]], which was simulated with the [[Strat-O-Matic]] tabletop game. According to announcer [[Mike Walczewski]], the series led to a 400 percent spike in Sports Phone's call volume.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; By 1982, daytime updates had been sped up to occur about every 15 minutes. Other information that the service provided included statistics, [[harness racing]] results, and listings of [[pitcher]]s in upcoming baseball games. One other type of programming that gained a following was a sports trivia game known as the "Quickie Quiz".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; An announcer asked a trivia question during an update, and callers contacted a different phone number to answer.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Winners were given 15 seconds of air time on a Sports Phone update to discuss a topic of their choice.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

Some content was added in certain locations' updates to appeal to the local markets. Different sports were mentioned in updates, along with reports on teams of local interest.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; This included listings of golf course and tennis court wait times as well.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The New York City operations center handled updates for multiple cities in the southern part of the U.S.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

As the popularity of Sports Phone started to decline, a new feature was launched that provided more detailed play-by-play information on games. Customers were charged 99 cents per minute for the calls, which did not have the regular service's time limit. La Greca once provided three consecutive hours of baseball play-by-play to one caller; the announcer stated that the target market for the play-by-play line was "the degenerate gambler."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; In the final years of Sports Phone's existence, announcers often obtained score information on the Internet before recording updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

==Announcers==
Writer Joe DeLessio described Sports Phone as "a launching pad for young voices looking to break into broadcasting."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The employees who announced updates for the service included future television broadcasters of the Mets and [[New York Yankees]] baseball clubs, and the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; La Greca, after beginning his career at Sports Phone, became a radio broadcaster for the [[New York Rangers]] and an [[ESPN Radio]] host in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=Imus, Mike and the Mad Dog, &amp; Doris from Rego Park: The Groundbreaking History of WFAN|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2013|pages=107–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTYFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|isbn=978-1-60078-828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mets announcer [[Howie Rose]], who began working for Sports Phone in 1975, likened his position to "anchoring the ''CBS Evening News''".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

A steady stream of announcers at the service's New York City operations came from [[Fordham University]]. Future Yankees television announcer [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]] and [[New York Giants]] radio voice [[Bob Papa]] were among the Fordham attendees who later announced for Sports Phone.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Some Sports Phone announcers who provided updates to southern locations, including Papa, applied pseudonyms in an effort "to sound less ethnic."&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11775">In [[media studies]], '''spreadability''' is the wide distribution and circulation of information on media platforms. The term was coined by  [[Henry Jenkins]] in the book ''Spreadable Media''. Spreadability contrasts with the "stickiness" of aggregating media in centralized places.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780814743508/|title=Spreadable Media {{!}} Creating Value and Meaning in a Networked Culture {{!}} Books - NYU Press {{!}} NYU Press|website=nyupress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original copy of the (textual, visual, audio) information does not need to be replicated perfectly in order to display the characteristics of spreadability, rather the original can be manipulated or maintained in its original form and still be a product of this process. Simply, this concept refers to the capability of media being spread. 

== Background ==
Spreadability was coined by [[Henry Jenkins]], a [[media scholar]] known for his work in communication studies. It "refers to the potential – both technical and cultural – for audiences to share content for their own purposes, sometimes with the permission of rights holders, sometimes against their wishes".{{sfnp|Jenkins|Ford|Green|2013|page=3}} It is contextualised in the media landscape due to the strong connection with quick and easy sharing practices which have been enabled by media platforms. After Jenkins coined this term (in a rather optimistic context) many authors such as Christian Fuchs{{sfnp|Fuchs|2014}} have interpreted this movement through a more pessimistic lens.

Spreadability is directly linked to the [[participatory culture]] which Jenkins also coined. Participatory culture is the backbone to spreadability as it depicts an image of people who are "shaping, sharing, reframing, and remixing media content".{{sfnp|Jenkins|Ford|Green|2013|page=3}} This culture is based on [[Grassroots|grass-root]] audience practices online. In other words, any user of a platform (that provides sharing possibilities) is emancipated as an individual who can informally, and instantaneously share information online. It is also important how the participatory culture and the act of sharing online "tends to be a communal act of giving and taking that links us to other people".{{sfnp|Hemetsberger|2012|page=118}}

== Prerequisites ==
Jenkins situates spreadability in a particular context. This concept is particularly contextualised in the social media era and the [[Web 2.0]] culture. These two transformations can be considered prerequisites for the idea of spreadibility to exist and for spreadable media to adopt such mechanisms to achieve spreadability.

This new culture began at the beginning of the second millennium when the [[internet]] became an interactive space. This means there was a need for a platform or platforms where users could contribute and share information. Belk says this is how the "Internet and especially Web 2.0 has brought about many new ways of sharing as well as facilitating older forms of sharing on a large-scale".&lt;ref name="Belk 2014"&gt;Belk, R. (2014). You are what you can access: Sharing and collaborative consumption online. Journal of Business Research. 67(8), p.1596''&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong emphasis on content production, but more concretely, [[user-generated content]] production. This is where the importance of social media (an affect of the Web 2.0) is relevant. Spreadable media is only possible when there is a platform where the content can be shared. As Jenkins puts it, "spreadability emphasizes producing content in easy-to-share formats […] which makes it easier to spread videos [or any other material] across the Internet, and encouraging access points to that content in a variety of places".{{sfnp|Jenkins|Ford|Green|2013|page=6}} Furthermore, as a result of this sharing community, the public has become more individually and collectively literate about social platforms and their ability to construct identities online.

Therefore, there are a handful of prerequisites that allow media to become spreadable, including, the Internet enabling power to the user, platforms incorporating share buttons or other means to easily pass on media to a specific audience, and for the public to have the required intelligence to carry out these actions. Moreover, there are also specific characteristics which allow certain platforms to have spreadable media on them.

== Key attributes ==
There are special characteristics that help to define what spreadability actually is. One key movement that underlines all the other characteristics is the change from [[Digital distribution|distribution]] to circulation. This means there is a [[community]] where individuals exchange 'meaningful bytes'.{{sfnp|Jenkins|Ford|Green|2013|page=4}}

Below is a table that describes how certain elements provided on a media platform engage the audience or viewer into becoming involved in the spreadability of information. The descriptions have been extracted from Jenkins, Ford &amp; Green 2013.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Characteristic !! Description
|-
| Open-ended Participation || This means that users can use existing material in unlimited and unpredictable ways
|-
| Collaboration Across Roles || There can be a blurring of lines between producer, marketer and audience because everyone can contribute
|-
| Motivating and Facilitating Sharing || The audience generates interest in different brands/franchises because of their sharing practices
|-
| Flow of Ideas || The individuals participating are not as important as their connections which are made visible through social media
|-
| Diversified Experiences || Sharing information may be for personal reasons that change the meaning of the original copy for different people
|}

== Consequences ==
One major aspect of sharing media is the loss of control of ownership. It is no longer a black and white picture where one rule can determine this distinction. [http://www.uibk.ac.at/smt/marketing/department/team/hemetsberger.html.en Hemetsberger] expands on this issue in her chapter "Let The Source Be With You". She says how when one engages in sharing information with others, they give up their ownership. She says it is "access over ownership".{{sfnp|Hemetsberger|2012|page=120}}  This is contextualised in a positive environment where individuals can profit from the resources others can provide and are not obligated to be self-dependent. For example, [[carsharing]] illustrates how the practice of sharing can be communal act of giving and taking that does not explicitly require ownership.{{sfnp|Hemetsberger|2012|page=118}} Another example is how one may upload a picture onto social media such as [[Facebook]] and by doing so, Facebook archives this information. What Facebook, or any other media platform does with this information which the user provides is sometimes not transparent although we agree to the [[Terms and Conditions May Apply|terms and conditions]] that explain this.

Sharing can therefore save time and money for individuals who profit from these practices. ''Profit'' in general has monetary connotations attached to it but in this context it does not need to refer to an exchange of money. This also connects to the type of sharing that is used. Hemetsberger names three types of sharing; ''sharing in'', ''sharing out'' and ''cross-sharing''.{{sfnp|Hemetsberger|2012}} It is especially through ''sharing in'' that leads to a feeling of belonging to a group or [[community]]. For example, when we share a cake between several people, there is a bond forming between those involved. "It is not the only way in which we connect with others, but it is a potential powerful one that creates feelings of solidarity and bonding"{{sfnp|Hemetsberger|2012|page=118}} that partaking in such practices creates.

Although Hemetsberger speaks of ownership, Christian Fuchs takes a more negative stance on the subject in relation to sharing practices. He relates Wikipedia to the idea of [[communism]] and [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;Fuchs 2014, chapter 10: Wikipedia: A New Democratic Form of Collaborative Work and Production?, pp. 235-250&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Wikipedians are prototypical contemporary communists"{{sfnp|Fuchs|2014|page=243}} where those contributing to, as well as those who use this platform are guilty. In other words, three contributing factors make those interacting with Wikipedia contemporary communists.

== Mediums and How They're Spread ==
'''Spreadability''' is possible through the use of media. A “medium” is any tool that can be used by anybody to deliver various forms of media (any information, a picture, etc.) to an individual or a group of people at any given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spreadablemedia.org/2015/04/13/applying-spreadable-media-to-new-realms/|title=Applying Spreadable Media to New Realms|last=NY|first=CHIPS|date=2015-04-13|work=Spreadable Media|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one could infer from the name, a “medium,” is essentially between two things (e.g. a person listening to the radio in their car).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Media Studies|last=Ott|first=Brian L.|last2=Mack|first2=Robert L.|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media content is produced, and/or ‘altered,’ &lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2643&amp;context=oa_dissertations&lt;/ref&gt; and then circulated on the media platform(s). According to Karcher, the three main types of spreadable media are “from scratch (original), altered (changed in someway before being circulated), and ‘as-is’ (circulated before any alterations are made).” No matter the involvement/contribution an individual takes part in when it comes to spreadable media, every aspect is extremely valuable because every person involved works together either directly or indirectly. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.  Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Jon. "Interview: Bryan Lewis Saunders." ''Rhythmplex'' April 2009.

'''''Star Trek''''' is an American [[space opera]] [[media franchise]] based on the [[science fiction]] [[television program|television series]] created by [[Gene Roddenberry]]. The first television series, simply called ''Star Trek'' and now referred to as "''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''", debuted in 1966 and aired for three seasons on the television network [[NBC]]. It followed the interstellar adventures of [[James T. Kirk|Captain James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) and his crew aboard the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']], a space exploration vessel, built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the twenty-third century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] of the franchise includes ''The Original Series'', an animated series, five spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.

In creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by the [[Horatio Hornblower]] novels, the satirical book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and by works of [[Western (genre)|western genre]] such as the television series ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Four spin-off television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' followed the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' set a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' set contemporaneously with ''The Next Generation''; and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' TV series, entitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'', premiered on [[CBS]] and was later made available exclusively on the digital platform [[CBS All Access]]. The adventures of ''The Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a "reboot" set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], or "Kelvin Timeline," entitled simply ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]].'' This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show; their adventures were continued in the sequel film, ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013). The thirteenth film feature and sequel, ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), was released to coincide with the franchise's 50th anniversary.

''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Italie| first =Hillel| title =Potter Reaches Cult Phenomenon Status| work =[[Seattle Times]]| agency =Associated Press| date =July 2, 2007| url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html| archivedate =June 28, 2011| df =mdy-all}} In this article, the status of Star Trek as a cult phenomenon is repeatedly taken as read.&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of the franchise are called [[Trekkie]]s or Trekkers.

==Background==

===Conception and setting===
[[File:Emblem.svg|thumb|upright=0.50|The Starfleet emblem as seen in the franchise]]
As early as 1964, [[Gene Roddenberry]] drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become ''Star Trek''. Although he publicly marketed it as a [[Space Western|Western in outer space]]—a so-called "''[[Wagon Train]]'' to the Stars"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=roddenberry | title=Gene Roddenberry | publisher=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] | accessdate=October 19, 2011 | quote=Roddenberry described ''Star Trek'' as a 'Wagon Train to the stars' because, like that popular series, its stories focused on the 'individuals who traveled to promote the expansion of our horizons.' | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011071758/http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=roddenberry | archivedate=October 11, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;—he privately told friends that he was modeling it on [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', intending each episode to act on two levels: as a suspenseful adventure story and as a [[morality tale]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Alexander (author)|David Alexander]], ''Star Trek Creator. The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry'' and interview with Roddenberry in ''Something about the Author'' by Gale Research Company and chapter 11 of ''Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition'' by Richard Keller Simon&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ''Star Trek'' stories depict the adventures of humans&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Members of the human species are occasionally called "Terrans" in ''Star Trek'', although usage has been inconsistent.&lt;/ref&gt; and aliens who serve in [[Starfleet]], the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The protagonists have [[altruism|altruistic]] values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.

Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of ''Star Trek'' represent [[allegory|allegories]] of contemporary cultural realities. ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' addressed issues of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Snyder| first =J. William, Jr.| title =Star Trek: A Phenomenon and Social Statement on the 1960s| publisher =self-published| year =1995| url =http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/wisdom/trek.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111127113425/http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/wisdom/trek.html| archivedate =November 27, 2011| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, [[authoritarianism]], [[imperialism]], class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, [[sexism]], feminism, and the role of technology.&lt;ref name="smith57"/&gt; Roddenberry stated: "[By creating] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on ''Star Trek'': we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network."&lt;ref name="smith79"/&gt; "If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sackett|first1=Susan|title=Susan Sackett - The Secular Humanism of Star Trek|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/susan_sackett_the_secular_humanism_of_star_trek/|website=Point of Inquiry|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=September 27, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005062918/http://www.pointofinquiry.org/susan_sackett_the_secular_humanism_of_star_trek/|archivedate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted ''Star Trek'' to show what humanity might develop into, if it would learn from the lessons of the past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave ''Star Trek'' an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Woody Goulart |url=http://woodygoulart.com/wg/trekology/star-trek/gene-roddenberry/ |title=Gene Roddenberry — Woody Goulart |publisher=Woodygoulart.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031212434/http://woodygoulart.com/wg/trekology/star-trek/gene-roddenberry|archivedate=October 31, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that ''Enterprise'' have a racially diverse crew.&lt;ref name="Whitfield128"/&gt;

===Mythology===
The central trio of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], [[Spock]], and [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]] from ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' was modeled on [[classical mythology|classical mythological]] storytelling.&lt;ref name="analogies"/&gt;

[[William Shatner]] said: {{quote|There is a mythological component [to pop culture], especially with science fiction. It's people looking for answers – and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable, the same as religion tends to do... If we accept the premise that it has a mythological element, then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life – trying to explain it and put a human element to it – it's a hopeful vision. All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Glen|title=William Shatner talks ‘Star Trek,’ sci-fi and fans|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|date=March 12, 2015|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article13446413.html|accessdate=August 31, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821115425/http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article13446413.html|archivedate=August 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Lutz wrote: {{quote|The enduring popularity of ''Star Trek'' is due to the underlying [[mythology]] which binds fans together by virtue of their shared love of stories involving exploration, discovery, adventure and friendship that promote an egalitarian and peace loving society where technology and diversity are valued rather than feared and citizens work together for the greater good. Thus ''Star Trek'' offers a hopeful vision of the future and a template for our lives and our society that we can aspire to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lutz|first=Richard|title=Social Cohesiveness|work=Human Rights Coalition (Australia)|date=February 2016|url=http://www.hrc-australia.org/info/socialcohesiveness.pdf|accessdate=March 18, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512024153/http://hrc-australia.org/info/socialcohesiveness.pdf|archivedate=May 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History and production==

{{Timeline of Star Trek franchise}}

===Beginnings===
[[File:Gene roddenberry 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|right|''Star Trek'' creator, producer and writer [[Gene Roddenberry]].]]
[[File:Leonard Nimoy William Shatner Star Trek 1968.JPG|thumb|Commander Spock and Captain James T. Kirk, played by [[Leonard Nimoy]] and [[William Shatner]], pictured here in ''The Original Series''.]]
In early 1964, Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a proposed ''Star Trek'' TV series to [[Desilu Productions]] comparing it to ''[[Wagon Train]]'', "a ''Wagon Train'' to the stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roddenberry | first = Gene | title = Star Trek is | version = First Draft | date = March 11, 1964 | url = http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/40_years/trek_pitch.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060924140423/http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/40_years/trek_pitch.pdf |archivedate= September 24, 2006 | format = PDF | accessdate =June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desilu worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a [[Screenplay|script]], which was then pitched to NBC.&lt;ref name="davies2007"/&gt;

[[NBC]] paid to make a pilot, "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]", starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as ''Enterprise'' [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]]. NBC rejected ''The Cage'', but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]".{{r|davies2007}}

The first regular episode ("[[The Man Trap]]") of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' aired on Thursday, September 8, 1966 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;"The numbers game, part one." Broadcasting. September 19, 1966: 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;However, the show had been first telecast two days earlier in Canada on the [[CTV Television Network]] at 7:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Fr8DH2VBP9sC&amp;dat=19660906&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Today's TV Previews", ''Montreal Gazette'', September 6, 1966, p36]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the show initially enjoyed high ratings, the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd out of 94 programs. Unhappy with the show's ratings, NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season.&lt;ref name="solow377"/&gt; The show's [[fan base]], led by [[Bjo Trimble]], conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning the network to keep the show on the air.&lt;ref name="solow377"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.startrek.com/article/bjo-trimble-the-woman-who-saved-star-trek-part-1 | title = Bjo Trimble: The Woman Who Saves Star Trek — Part 1 | last = StarTrek.com Staff | date = August 31, 2011 | work = StarTrek.com | publisher = CBS Entertainment | quote = For the record, when NBC seemed to be on the verge of axing Star Trek after a low-rated second season, the Trimbles devised a grassroots letter-writing campaign that saved the show and resulted in a third season. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120121164142/http://www.startrek.com/article/bjo-trimble-the-woman-who-saved-star-trek-part-1 | archivedate = January 21, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC renewed the show, but moved it from primetime to the "[[Friday night death slot]]", and substantially reduced its budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shatner|Kreski|1993|pp=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in ''Star Trek'', which led to [[Fred Freiberger]] becoming producer for the show's third and final season.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Roddenberry did, however, co-author two scripts for the third season.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite another letter-writing campaign, NBC cancelled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes.{{r|davies2007}}

===Rebirth===
After the original series was cancelled, Paramount Studios, which had bought the series from Desilu, licensed the [[broadcast syndication]] rights to help recoup the production losses. Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped ''Star Trek'' develop a [[cult following]] greater than its popularity during its original run.&lt;ref name="shult19720703"/&gt;

One sign of the series' growing popularity was the first [[Science fiction convention|''Star Trek'' convention]] which occurred on January 21–23, 1972 in New York City. Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred, several thousand fans turned up. ''Star Trek'' fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide.&lt;ref name=Convention&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.startrek.com/article/celebrating-40-years-since-treks-1st-convention | title=Celebrating 40 Years since ''Trek''{{'}}s 1st Convention | publisher=startrek.com | date=January 20, 2012 | accessdate=August 1, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HzMlJfR1?url=http://www.startrek.com/article/celebrating-40-years-since-treks-1st-convention | archivedate=July 9, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise.&lt;ref name="sackett-15"/&gt; [[Filmation]] with [[Paramount Television]] produced the first post original series show, ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]''. It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974.&lt;ref name="Turnbull208"/&gt; Although short-lived, typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period, the series garnered the franchise's only "Best Series" [[Emmy Award]] as opposed to the franchise's later technical ones. [[Paramount Pictures]] and Roddenberry began developing a new series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'', in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. Work on the series ended, however, when the proposed [[Paramount Television Service]] folded.

Following the success of the science fiction movies ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{efn|''Star Wars'' has become the name of the mega franchise, while the first produced film in the franchise has been officially titled ''A New Hope'' by Lucasfilms since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope|title=Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of ''Phase II'' into the feature film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.

The success of the critically acclaimed sequel, ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six ''Star Trek'' feature films between 1979 and 1991. In response to the popularity of ''Star Trek'' feature films, the franchise returned to television with ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') in 1987. Paramount chose to distribute it as a [[first-run syndication]] show rather than a network show.{{sfn|Alexander|1995|p=545}}

===After Roddenberry===
Following ''Star Trek: The Motion Picture'', Roddenberry's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Roddenberry died on October 24, 1991, giving executive producer [[Rick Berman]] control of the franchise.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Smith268"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander591–593"/&gt; ''Star Trek'' had become known to those within Paramount as "the franchise", because of its great success and recurring role as a [[tent-pole programming|tent pole]] for the studio when other projects failed.&lt;ref name="teitelbaum19910505"/&gt; ''TNG'' had the highest ratings of any ''Star Trek'' series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run.&lt;ref name="TNG ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205052936/http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/history.html |archivedate= December 5, 2010|title= Star Trek — A Short History|accessdate=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to ''TNG's'' success, Paramount released a spin-off series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' in 1993. While never as popular as ''TNG'', the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.

In January 1995, a few months after ''TNG'' ended, Paramount released a fourth TV series, ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]''. ''Star Trek'' saturation reached a peak in the mid-1990s with ''DS9'' and ''Voyager'' airing concurrently and three of the four ''TNG''-based feature films released in 1994, 1996, and 1998. By 1998, ''Star Trek'' was Paramount's most important property; the enormous profits of "the franchise" funded much of the rest of the studio's operations.&lt;ref name="poe1998"&gt;{{cite book| author = Poe, Stephen Edward| title = A Vision of the Future| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MiJTlrdSkpAC| date = April 1, 1998| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 0-671-53481-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50,54}} ''Voyager'' became the flagship show of the new [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] (UPN) and thus the first major network ''Star Trek'' series since the original.&lt;ref name="Voyagerflagship"&gt;{{cite news| last = Levesque| first = John| title = UPN in Search of Post-'Voyager' Flagship| publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer| date = January 6, 2001| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205023950/http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/upn06.shtml |archivedate=December 5, 2010 | accessdate =June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Voyager'' ended, UPN produced ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', a prequel TV series to the original show. ''Enterprise'' did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the ''Original Series''. Paramount renewed ''Enterprise'' for a fourth season,&lt;ref name="entrenew"&gt;{{cite web | title = Fan Groups, Sites Rally on Behalf of ''Enterprise'' | publisher = startrek.com| date = May 28, 2004| url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117112055/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archivedate= January 17, 2010| accessdate =October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved it to the [[Friday night death slot]].&lt;ref name="entrenew2"&gt;{{cite press release| title = UPN's 2004–2005 Schedule| publisher = UPN| date = May 20, 2004| url = http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117112055/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5500.html |archivedate= January 17, 2010| accessdate =October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Original Series'', ''Enterprise'' ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled ''Enterprise'' at the end of its fourth season.

The cancellation of ''Enterprise'' ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of ''Star Trek'' programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'', cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of ''Star Trek''.

===Reboot===
Paramount turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise. These included pitches from film director [[Bryan Singer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/bryan-singer-tv-star-trek |title=Bryan Singer's TV Star Trek Details Emerge! |publisher=Ugo.com |date=April 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416025007/http://www.ugo.com/tv/bryan-singer-tv-star-trek |archive-date=April 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Babylon 5]]'' creator [[J.

Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' producer, [[J. J. Abrams]], had the freedom to reinvent the feel of ''Trek''.

The team created the franchise's eleventh film, entitled simply ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], known as the "Kelvin Timeline". This gave the film and future sequels to it freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline.

==Television series==
Seven television series make up the bulk of the ''Star Trek'' mythos: ''The Original Series'', ''The Animated Series'', ''The Next Generation'', ''Deep Space Nine'', ''Voyager'', ''Enterprise'', and ''Discovery''. All the different versions in total amount to [[List of Star Trek episodes|741 ''Star Trek'' episodes]] across the 31 seasons of the TV series.&lt;ref group=Note name= "numbers"&gt;This count includes all planned episodes of ''Star Trek Discovery'' through season one. it also includes the animated series, and the original pilot, "The Cage". Two-part episodes that were not originally aired at the same time are considered two separate episodes. Ten feature-length episodes were originally aired as two-hour presentations and are sometimes considered single episodes, however, in this count, they too are seen as two individual episodes.

The ''Star Trek'' wiki [[Memory Alpha]] differs from the count listed because it includes the feature films in its total and it uses the method that counts feature-length episodes as single episodes. This makes that wiki's total release count 744.

''Star Trek: The Animated Series'', produced by Filmation, ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974.

''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', also known as "''TNG''", takes place about a century after ''The Original Series'' (2364–2370). It features a new starship, [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]], and a new crew led by Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and Commander [[William Riker]] ([[Jonathan Frakes]]). Some crewmembers represent new alien races, including [[Deanna Troi]], a half-[[Betazoid]] counselor played by [[Marina Sirtis]].

''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', also known as "''DS9''", takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of ''The Next Generation'' (2369–2375) and aired for seven seasons, debuting the week of January 3, 1993.&lt;ref name="DS9 series"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/star-trek-deep-space-nine/|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|publisher=TV.com|access-date=August 21, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910142559/http://www.tv.com/shows/star-trek-deep-space-nine/|archivedate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other ''Star Trek'' series, ''DS9'' takes place primarily on a [[space station]] rather than aboard a starship.

The show begins after the brutal [[Cardassian]] occupation of the planet [[Bajor]]. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable [[wormhole]] that provides immediate access to the distant [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)|Gamma Quadrant]] making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy.&lt;ref name="Emissary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i |title=STARTREK.COM: Emissary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011115319/http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i |archive-date=October 11, 2010 |access-date=August 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) [[Benjamin Sisko]], played by [[Avery Brooks]], and Major (later Colonel) [[Kira Nerys]], played by [[Nana Visitor]]. Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the [[Bajoran]]s as the Emissary of the [[Prophet (Star Trek)|Prophets]], and in later seasons a war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].

''Deep Space Nine'' stands apart from earlier ''Trek'' series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themes—all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and ''The Next Generation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407175159/http://scifi.about.com/blinterarma2.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2003 |title=Review of "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges" |accessdate=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of ''DS9'', making this the last ''Star Trek'' series connected to Gene Roddenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/trivia|title=Trivia for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=October 19, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020213636/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/trivia|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voyager'' takes place at about the same time period as ''Deep Space Nine'' and the years following that show's end (2371–2378). The premiere episode has the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] and its crew pursue a [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] (Federation rebels) ship.

Like ''Deep Space Nine'', early seasons of ''Voyager'' feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between "by-the-book" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of ''The Original Series''. The starship ''Voyager'', isolated from its home, faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons, however, brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows, the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], the [[Ferengi]], [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Cardassian]]s and cast members of ''The Next Generation''.

The show centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp 5 capable starship, ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', commanded by Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] (played by [[Scott Bakula]]), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander [[T'Pol]] (played by [[Jolene Blalock]]).

During the show's first two seasons, ''Enterprise'' featured self-contained episodes, like ''The Original Series'', ''The Next Generation'' and ''Voyager''. The third season consisted of one arc, "[[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi mission]]", which had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of ''Deep Space 9''. Season 4 consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series, and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various ''Star Trek'' series. Ratings for ''Enterprise'' started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast reviled the series [[These Are the Voyages...#Reception|finale]], partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of members of ''The Next Generation'' cast.&lt;ref&gt;Jolene Blalock's negative reaction is discussed at {{cite web|author=Lee, Patrick |date=May 14, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html |archivedate=January 1, 2007 |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html |title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale |publisher=[[Sci Fi Weekly]] |accessdate=January 16, 2009 }} Travis Mayweather's reaction is discussed at {{cite web|author=Leao, Gustavo |date=December 17, 2005 |url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&amp;topBrowse=all |title=Anthony Montgomery Says "These Are the Voyages..."

The show centers on the voyages of the ''Discovery'', commanded by Captain Gabriel Lorca (played by [[Jason Isaacs]]), and Lieutenant Commander [[Michael Burnham]] (played by [[Sonequa Martin-Green]]), with Burnham being the lead character of the series. This marks the first ''Star Trek'' series to feature a First Officer as the lead character. The show features the [[Klingon]] T'Kuvma attempting to unite the 24 great Klingon houses, leading to a war between his race and the [[United Federation of Planets]] that involves the crew of the ''Discovery''.&lt;ref name="KlingonsDesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/17/star-trek-discovery-klingons-photo/|title=Star Trek: Discovery producer explains why the Klingons changed|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 17, 2017|accessdate=July 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6s29kBUDc?url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/17/star-trek-discovery-klingons-photo/|archivedate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SDCCGalleryKlingons2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-trek-discovery-comic-con-exhibit/2/|title=‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Exhibit Reveals Starfleet, Klingon and Vulcan Props, Costumes &amp; Ships [Comic-Con 2017]|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=July 21, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6s8RnL7ex?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-trek-discovery-comic-con-exhibit/2/|archivedate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Star Trek (film series)}}
Paramount Pictures has produced thirteen ''Star Trek'' feature films, the most recent being released in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888/&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727070045/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888/ |date=July 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of ''The Original Series''; the seventh film, ''Generations'' was designed as a transition from that cast to ''The Next Generation'' television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the ''Next Generation'' cast.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Film titles of the North American and UK releases of the films no longer contained the number of the film following the sixth film (the sixth was ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' but the seventh was ''Star Trek Generations''). However, European releases continued using numbers in the film titles until ''Nemesis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the eleventh film, the movies take place in an alternate timeline with a new cast playing the original series characters. Leonard Nimoy portrays an elderly Spock in these films, providing a physical link to the original timeline. This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, for the computer game ''Star Trek Online'', the Kelvin Timeline.

They are also a continuation of the franchise that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This was done to free the new films from the restrictions of continuity without completely discarding it. This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the "Abramsverse", "JJ Trek", the "alternate timeline" and "NuTrek". It was named the "Kelvin Timeline", as opposed to the "Prime Timeline" of the original series and films, by Michael and Denise Okuda for use in reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS Kelvin, a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in 2009's ''Star Trek''. Leonard Nimoy plays an older version of Spock in the film ''Star Trek'' to help link the two timelines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond ''Star Trek''{{'}}s fictional innovations, its contributions to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While more common in subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode "[[Plato's Stepchildren]]", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one.{{Citation needed|reason=a common misconception|date=October 2017}} In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that ''Star Trek'' was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [She told King about her plans to leave the series.] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't.

Both ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' television series and others have had many individual episodes parodying ''Star Trek'' or with ''Trek'' allusions.{{sfn|Geraghty|2007|pages=51–52}} An entire series of films and novels from Finland entitled ''[[Star Wreck]]'' also parodies ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitmore|first1=Linda|title=‘Star Wreck,’ from Finland with love|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/star-wreck-is-the-best-finnish-star-trek-parody-ever/|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2017-12-18|date=November 10, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027104914/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/star-wreck-is-the-best-finnish-star-trek-parody-ever/|archivedate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the members of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] created a ''Star Trek'' themed training video for a conference. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds in a congressional investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/irs-official-apologizes-star-trek-spoof-video-article-1.1365589 | title=IRS Official Apologizes for Wasting Funds on 'Star Trek' Spoof Video | publisher=New York Daily News | accessdate=May 24, 2016 | date=June 6, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531041951/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/irs-official-apologizes-star-trek-spoof-video-article-1.1365589 | archivedate=May 31, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2013/0604/How-much-did-IRS-spend-filming-Star-Trek-spoof-video | title=How Much did IRS Spend Filming 'Star Trek' Spoof? | publisher=The Christian Science Monitor | date=June 4, 2013 | accessdate=May 24, 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605234446/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2013/0604/How-much-did-IRS-spend-filming-Star-Trek-spoof-video | archivedate=June 5, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Trek'' has been parodied in several non-English movies, including the German ''[[Traumschiff Surprise - Periode 1]]'' which features a gay version of ''The Original Series'' bridge crew and a Turkish film that spoofs that same series' episode "[[The Man Trap]]" in one of the series of films based on the character [[Turist Ömer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''[[The Orville]]'' is a comedy-drama science fiction television series that is currently airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], with the same look and feel as the ''Star Trek'' universe, created by noted Trekkie [[Seth MacFarlane]] that premiered on September 10, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/16/15646290/the-orville-trailer-star-trek-parody-fox |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518231641/https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/16/15646290/the-orville-trailer-star-trek-parody-fox |archivedate=May 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane has made references to ''Star Trek'' on his animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'', where the ''Next Generation'' cast guest-starred in the episode "[[Not All Dogs Go to Heaven]]".

===Notable fan fiction===
{{main|Star Trek fan productions}}
Although ''Star Trek'' has been off the air since 2005, CBS and Paramount pictures have allowed fan-produced shows to be created. While not officially part of the ''Star Trek'' universe, several veteran ''Star Trek'' actors, actresses, and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions. While none of these films have been created for profit, several fan productions have turned to [[crowdfunding]] from sites, such as [[Kickstarter]] to help with production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howell|first1=Elizabeth|title='Star Trek: Axanar' Fan Film Warps Beyond Crowdfunding Goal|url=http://www.space.com/26839-star-trek-axanar-kickstarter-fan-film.html|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=September 25, 2014|date=August 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913181615/http://www.space.com/26839-star-trek-axanar-kickstarter-fan-film.html|archivedate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two series set during the ''TOS'' time period are ''[[Star Trek Continues]]'' and the Hugo award nominated ''[[Star Trek: Phase II (fan series)|Star Trek: Phase II]]''. Another series, ''[[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]]'', takes place in the Briar Patch, a region of space introduced in ''Star Trek Insurrection''. It has had over 50 episodes produced, and has two spin-off series, ''Star Trek: Odyssey'' and ''Star Trek: The Helena Chronicles''. Several standalone fan films have been created including ''[[Star Trek: Of Gods and Men]]''. Future fan films include ''[[Star Trek: Axanar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kickstarter&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/194429923/star-trek-prelude-to-axanar Star Trek: Prelude to Axanar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009220529/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/194429923/star-trek-prelude-to-axanar |date=October 9, 2014 }}&lt;br /&gt;Prelude to Axanar features some well known actors portraying both new and familiar characters in the Star Trek universe.&lt;/ref&gt; Audio only fan productions includes ''Star Trek: The Continuing Mission''. Several fan film parodies have also been created.

The original ''Star Trek'' series is also notable for giving rise to [[slash fiction]], a genre of fan-produced in-universe fiction where normally non-romantic same-sex characters are portrayed as being a romantic couple, notably "Kirk/Spock" stories. These began appearing in the early 1970s, generally written by female fans of the show.&lt;ref name="SATW"&gt;Bacon-Smith, Camille. "Spock Among the Women."

In 2016, Paramount and CBS instituted strict fan guidelines on fan films. Notable guidelines include a maximum length of 15 minutes, a maximum fund limit of $50,000, and a ban on using individuals previously associated with ''Star Trek'' productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Trek Fan Films|url=http://www.startrek.com/fan-films|website=StarTrek.com|accessdate=January 16, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120033226/http://www.startrek.com/fan-films|archivedate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has shut down all of the highly publicized fan film productions ending what has been called a "golden age of amateur ''Star Trek'' films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinelli|first1=Marissa|title=To Boldly Go Where No Fan Production Has Gone Before|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/moneybox/2016/07/crowdfunding_gave_us_a_golden_age_of_amateur_star_trek_and_then_led_to_its.html|accessdate=January 16, 2017|work=Slate|date=July 13, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118134333/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/moneybox/2016/07/crowdfunding_gave_us_a_golden_age_of_amateur_star_trek_and_then_led_to_its.html|archivedate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Of the various science fiction awards for drama, only the [[Hugo Award]] dates back as far as the original series.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Although the [[Hugo Award]] is mainly given for print-media science fiction, its "best drama" award is usually given to film or television presentations. The Hugo does not give out awards for best actor, director, or other aspects of film production. Before 2002, films and television series competed for the same Hugo, before the split of the drama award into short drama and long drama.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of ''Star Trek'', as were three of the five nominees in 1967.&lt;ref name=Turnbull231 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The other two films nominated for the Hugo in 1967 were the films ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The only ''Star Trek'' series not even to get a Hugo nomination are the animated series and ''Voyager'', though only the original series and ''Next Generation'' ever won the award. No ''Star Trek'' feature film has ever won a Hugo, though a few were nominated. In 2008, the fan-made episode of ''[[Star Trek: Phase II (fan series)|Star Trek: New Voyages]]'' entitled "World Enough and Time" was nominated for the Hugo for Best Short Drama.&lt;ref&gt;Full lists of Hugo award winners are at {{cite web |url=http://dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011170320/http://www.dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }} Nominations can be found at {{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/HugoNomList.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 20, 2011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920202744/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/HugoNomList.html |archivedate=September 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, ''[[TV Guide]]'' picked the following as the ten best ''Star Trek'' episodes for the franchise's 30th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Logan |first=Michael |date=August 24, 1996 |title=10 Truly Stellar Episodes |magazine= [[TV Guide]] |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ''Star Trek'' series to win multiple [[Saturn awards]] during their run were ''The Next Generation'' (twice winning for best television series) and ''Voyager'' (twice winning for best actress – [[Kate Mulgrew]] and [[Jeri Ryan]]).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The science fiction [[Saturn Awards]] did not exist during broadcasting of the original series. Unlike the Hugo, the Saturn Award gives out prizes for best actor, special effects and music, and also unlike the Hugo (until 2002) movies and television shows have never competed against each other for Saturns.&lt;/ref&gt; The original series retroactively won a Saturn Award for best DVD release. Several ''Star Trek'' films have won Saturns including categories best actor, actress, director, costume design, and special effects. However, ''Star Trek'' has never won a Saturn for best make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SaturnNomList.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512152954/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SaturnNomList.html |archivedate= May 12, 2009 |title=Saturn award winners and nominees can be found at |publisher=Locusmag.com |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate ownership==
At ''Star Trek''{{'}}s creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's production company, shared ownership with [[Desilu Productions]] and, after [[Gulf+Western]] acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio. Paramount did not want to own the unsuccessful show; net profit was to be shared between Norway, Desilu/Paramount, Shatner, and NBC but ''Star Trek'' lost money, and the studio did not expect to syndicate it. In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to ''Star Trek'' to Roddenberry, but he could not afford the $150,000 cost ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}).{{r|davies2007}}

In 1989, Gulf+Western renamed itself as Paramount Communications, and in 1994 merged with [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]].{{r|davies2007}} In 2005, Viacom divided into [[CBS Corporation]], whose [[CBS Television Studios]] subsidiary retained the ''Star Trek'' brand, and [[Viacom]], whose Paramount Pictures subsidiary retained the ''Star Trek'' film library and rights to make additional films, along with video distribution rights to the TV series on behalf of CBS.&lt;ref name="trekmovie"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/02/11/star-trek-helps-bring-big-profits-to-viacom-paramount/ | title=Star Trek Helps Bring Big Profits To Viacom &amp; Paramount | work=Trekmovie.com | date=February 11, 2010 | accessdate=October 19, 2011 | author=Pascale, Anthony | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014082311/http://trekmovie.com/2010/02/11/star-trek-helps-bring-big-profits-to-viacom-paramount/ | archivedate=October 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|davies2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas!  Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE:                      Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE:                                  Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense.  [''Il lui donne un soufflet''
&lt;ref&gt;
COUNT: What I deserved, you carried away.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who won it over you had deserved it more.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: You had it by intrigue, being an old courtier.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The luster of my high deeds was my only supporter.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: And by that the honor was owed to my arm only.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who could not obtain it did not deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Did not deserve it!  I?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO:                      You.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT:                                  Your impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Rash old man, will have its reward.  [''He slaps him'']
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6384">The '''Thai Elephant Orchestra''' is a musical ensemble consisting of as many as fourteen [[Thai elephant]]s near [[Lampang]] in Northern [[Thailand]].  The elephants play music, essentially as conducted improvisations, on specially designed heavy-duty [[musical instrument]]s. The orchestra was co-created by elephant conservationist [[Richard Lair]] of the [[National Elephant Institute]]  and the American musical artist and [[neuroscientist]] [[Dave Soldier]].  They have released three CDs on the [[Mulatta Records]] label with an orchestra ranging in size from six to fourteen elephants.  The orchestra currently performs for visitors at the center.

==Background==
It has been noted since ancient times that elephants seem to have an affinity for music.   Performing circus elephants commonly follow musical cues, and early American circuses such as [[Adam Forepaugh]] and [[Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]] even featured "elephant bands."&lt;ref name=NYT(2000) /&gt;  In the 1950s, German evolutionary biologist [[Bernard Rensch]] found that elephants can distinguish 12 tones on the musical scale and remember simple melodies, even when played on different instruments at various pitches, timbres, and meters.&lt;ref name=NYT(2000)&gt;{{cite news|last=Scigliano|first=Eric|title=Think Tank; A Band With a Lot More to Offer Than Talented Trumpeters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/arts/think-tank-a-band-with-a-lot-more-to-offer-than-talented-trumpeters.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 16, 2000|location=Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist&gt;{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Graciela|title=When I see an elephant...paint?|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25148/title/When-I-see-an-elephant---paint-/|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=21 March 2013|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An album of music created by elephant musicians was conceived by New York-based musical artist Dave Soldier (a.k.a. [[David Sulzer]], PhD) and elephant expert Richard Lair, who works at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang. [[Traditional Thai music]] is a genre familiar to the elephants, so they chose Thai music scales with a few blues notes. According to Lair, many of the elephants took to their assignment "with gusto".&lt;ref name="PRI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Band : Transcript|url=http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=01-P13-00009&amp;segmentID=11|work=PRI : Living on Earth|publisher=World Media Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=Air Date: Week of March 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai Elephant Orchestra primarily uses the ''Lanna'' Thai [[Pentatonic scale|five-note scale]], and most instruments are heavy-duty versions of [[traditional Thai musical instruments]]; additional instruments include drums and harmonica.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soldier|first=Dave|title=Eine Kleine Naughtmusik: How Nefarious Nonartists Cleverly Imitate Music|journal=Leonardo Music Journal|year=2002|volume=12|pages=57–58|url=http://mulatta.org/articles/Soldier_Leonardo.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=25 March 2013|doi=10.1162/096112102762295142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their musical works are of two general types. The first type features the elephants individually improvising on the instruments with the only human interaction being cues as to when to start and stop. The other type is compositional and requires [[mahout]]s to teach or train the elephants to perform human tunes as a [[hocket]], with each elephant playing an individual note on tuned instruments such as [[Angklung|angalung]]s.&lt;ref name=WNYC&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Elephants on Parade|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|work=WNYC|publisher=New York Public Radio|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=New Sounds : Episode #2329|date=October 12, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728104228/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/2004/oct/12/|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations''''' is a descriptive list which was created by [[Georges Polti]] to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this Polti analyzed classical [[ancient Greece|Greek]] texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction, Polti claims to be continuing the work of [[Carlo Gozzi]], who also identified 36 situations.

==Publication history==
{{quote box|align=right|width=300px|quote=“Gozzi maintained that there can be but thirty-six tragic situations. Schiller took great pains to find more, but he was unable to find even so many as Gozzi.” |source= —[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Polti |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Polti |title=The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:The_thirty-six_dramatic_situations_(1921).djvu |year=1921 |month= |origyear=1916 |publisher=James Knapp Reeve |location=Franklin, Ohio |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list was published in a book of the same name, which contains extended explanations and examples.  The original French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation was published in 1916 and continues to be reprinted to this day.

The list is popularized as an aid for writers, but it is also used by dramatists, [[storytelling|storyteller]]s and many others. Other similar lists have since been made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11986">'''Narrative transportation theory''' proposes that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. The mental state of narrative transportation can explain the persuasive effect of stories on people, who may experience narrative transportation when certain contextual and personal preconditions are met, as Green and Brock&lt;ref&gt;Green, M. C., &amp; Brock, T. C. (2002). "In the mind's eye: Transportation-imagery model of narrative persuasion." In M. C. Green, J. J. Strange &amp; T. C. Brock (Eds.), ''Narrative impact: Social and cognitive foundations''. (pp. 315-341). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; postulate for the transportation-imagery model. As van Laer, de Ruyter, Visconti, and Wetzels&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt; elaborate further, narrative transportation occurs whenever the story receiver experiences a feeling of entering a world evoked by the narrative because of empathy for the story characters and imagination of the story plot.

== Defining the field ==
Deighton, Romer, and McQueen&lt;ref name=deighton1989&gt;Deighton, J., Romer, D., &amp; McQueen, J. (1989). "Using drama to persuade." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 16''(3), 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|335}} anticipate the construct of narrative transportation by arguing that a story invites story receivers into the action it portrays and, as a result, makes them lose themselves in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Nell, V. (1988). ''Lost in a book: The psychology of reading for pleasure''. New Haven, CT: Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrig&lt;ref&gt;Gerrig, R. J. (1993). ''Experiencing narrative worlds: On the psychological activities of reading''. New Haven, CT: Yale.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to coin the notion of narrative transportation within the context of novels. Using travel as a metaphor for reading, he conceptualizes narrative transportation as a state of detachment from the world of origin that the story receiver—in his words, the traveler—experiences because of his or her engrossment in the story, a condition that Green and Brock&lt;ref&gt;Green, M. C., &amp; Brock, T. C. (2000). "The role of transportation in the persuasiveness of public narratives." ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79''(5), 701-721.&lt;/ref&gt; later describe as the story receiver's experience of being carried away by the story. Notably, the state of narrative transportation makes the world of origin partially inaccessible to the story receiver, thus marking a clear separation in terms of here/there and now/before, or narrative  world/world of origin.

===Relevant features===
Most research on narrative transportation follows the original definition of the construct. Scholars in the field constantly reaffirm the relevance of three features. 
# Narrative transportation requires that people process stories—the acts of receiving and interpreting.
# Story receivers become transported through two main components: empathy and mental imagery. Empathy implies that story receivers try to understand the experience of a story character, that is, to know and feel the world in the same way. Thus, empathy offers an explanation for the state of detachment from the world of origin that is narrative transportation. In mental imagery, story receivers generate vivid images of the story plot, such that they feel as though they are experiencing the events themselves.
# When transported, story receivers lose track of reality in a physiological sense. 
In accordance with these features, van Laer et al.&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014&gt;van Laer, T., de Ruyter, K., Visconti, L. M., &amp; Wetzels, M. (2014). "The Extended Transportation-Imagery Model: A meta-analysis of the antecedents and consequences of consumers' narrative transportation." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 40''(5), 797-817. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2033192 or doi: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/673383&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|799}} define narrative transportation as the extent to which 
# an individual empathizes with the story characters and 
# the story plot activates his or her imagination,
which leads him or her to experience suspended reality during story reception.

===Similar constructs===
Narrative transportation is a form of experiential response to narratives and thus is similar to other constructs, such as absorption, optimal experience or [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], and [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]]. Yet several subtle, critical differences exist. Absorption refers to a personality trait or general tendency to be immersed in life experiences; transportation  is an engrossing temporary experience. Flow is a more general construct (i.e., people can experience flow in a variety of activities), whereas transportation specifically entails empathy and mental imagery, which do not occur in flow experiences.  Phillips and McQuarrie&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, B. J. and E. F. McQuarrie (2010). "Narrative and persuasion in fashion advertising." ''Journal of Consumer Research 37''(3), 368-392.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that immersion is primarily an experiential response to aesthetic and visual elements of images, whereas narrative transportation relies on a story with plot and characters, features that are not present in immersion.

== Narrative persuasion ==
Since narrative transportation's conceptualization, research has demonstrated that the transported "traveler" can return changed by the journey. Subsequent studies have confirmed that a story can engross the story receiver in a transformational experience, whose effects are strong and long-lasting. The transformation that narrative transportation achieves is persuasion of the story receiver. More specifically, van Laer et al.'s&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt; literature review reveals that narrative transportation can cause affective and cognitive responses, beliefs, and attitude and intention changes. However, the processing pattern of narrative transportation is markedly different from that in well-established models of persuasion.

===Rival models===
Before 2000, dual-process models of persuasion, especially the [[elaboration likelihood model]] and [[heuristic-systematic model]], dominated persuasion research. These models attempt to explain why people accept or reject message claims. According to these models, the determination of a claim's acceptability can result from careful evaluation of the arguments presented or from reliance on superficial cues, such as the presence of an expert. Whether receivers scrutinize a message depends on the extent to which they are able and motivated to process it systematically. As important variables, these models include empathy, familiarity, involvement, and the number and nature of thoughts the message evokes. If these variables are mainly positive, the receiver's attitudes and intentions tend to be more positive; if the variables are predominantly negative, the resulting attitudes and intentions are more negative. These variables also exist in narrative persuasion.

===Differences between analytical and narrative persuasion===
Analytical persuasion and narrative persuasion differ depending on the role of involvement. In analytical persuasion, involvement depends on the extent to which the message has personally relevant consequences for a receiver's money, time, or other resources. If these consequences are sufficiently severe, receivers evaluate the arguments carefully and generate thoughts related to the arguments. Yet, as Slater&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. D. (2002). "Entertainment education and the persuasive impact of narratives." In T. C. Brock, M. C. Green &amp; J. J. Strange (Eds.), ''Narrative impact: Social and cognitive foundations'' (pp. 157-181). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}} notes, even though severe consequences for stories are relatively rare, "viewers or readers of an entertainment narrative typically appear to be far more engrossed in the message." This type of involvement, or narrative transportation, is arguably the crucial determinant of narrative persuasion.

Though the dual-process models provide a valid description of analytical persuasion, they do not encompass narrative persuasion. Analytical persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing messages that are overtly persuasive, such as most lessons in science books, news reports, and speeches. However, narrative persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing narrative messages that are not overtly persuasive, such as novels, movies, or video games. Addressing the strength and duration of the persuasive effects of processing stories, narrative transportation is a mental state that produces enduring persuasive effects without careful evaluation of arguments. Transported story receivers are engrossed in a story in a way that neither is inherently critical nor involves great scrutiny.

===Sleeper effect===
Narrative transportation seems to be more unintentionally affective than intentionally cognitive in nature. This way of processing leads to potentially increasing and long-lasting persuasive effects. Appel and Richter&lt;ref&gt;Appel, M., &amp; Richter, T. (2007). "Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time." ''Media Psychology, 10''(1), 113-134.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} use the term "sleeper effect" to describe this paradoxical property of narrative transportation over time, which consists of a more pronounced change in attitudes and intentions and a greater certainty that these attitudes and intentions are correct.

Plausible explanations for the sleeper effect are twofold. 
# According to [[poststructural]] research, language's articulation in narrative format is capable not only of mirroring reality but also of constructing it. As such, stories could cause profound and durable persuasion of the transported story receiver as a result of his or her progressive internalization. When stories transport story receivers, not only do they present a narrative world but, by reframing the story receiver's language, they also durably change the world to which the story receiver returns after the transportation experience. 
# Research demonstrates that people analyze and retain stories differently from other information formats. For example, Deighton et al.&lt;ref name=deighton1989 /&gt; show that analytical advertisements stimulate cognitive responses whereas narrative advertisements are more likely to stimulate affective responses.
Following this line of reasoning, van Laer et al.&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt;{{rp|801}} define narrative persuasion as
:''the effect of narrative transportation, which manifests itself in story receivers' affective and cognitive responses, beliefs, attitudes, and intentions from being swept away by a story and transported into a narrative world that modifies their perception of their world of origin.''
:
The conceptual distinction between analytical persuasion and narrative persuasion and the theoretical framework of sound interpretation of narrative persuasion both ground the extended transportation-imagery model (ETIM).

===Moderators===
ETIM contains three methodological factors that moderate the overall effect of narrative transportation, as van Laer, Feiereisen, and Visconti&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., Feiereisen, S., &amp; Visconti, L. M. "Storytelling in the digital era: A meta-analysis of relevant moderators of the narrative transportation effect." ''Journal of Business Research''. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3156933&lt;/ref&gt; detail. The narrative transportation effect is stronger
# for stories in the commercial (vs. non-commercial) domain,
# for stories by users (vs. professionals), and
# for stories received alone (vs. with others).

{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}

'''Trash-talk''' is a form of insult usually found in sports events, although it is not exclusive to just sports or similarly characterized events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/trash_talk|title=trash talk - Definition of trash talk in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to intimidate the opposition, but can also be used in a [[Humour|humorous]] spirit. Trash-talk is often characterized by use of [[hyperbole]] or figurative language, such as, "Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!" [[Pun]]s and other wordplay are commonly used.

Trash-talk was commonly used by the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion [[Muhammad Ali]] in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled ''[[I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)|I Am the Greatest!]]'', a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, [[Wrestling|wrestlers]], and many other sports competitors to use trash-talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Derrick Z. |last= Jackson | url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/02/02/the_kings_of_trash_talk/ |title= The kings of trash talk| website= Boston.com| publisher= ''Boston Globe'', Globe Newspaper Company| date= February 2, 2010| accessdate= March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in amateur sports ranks, trash talking is generally frowned upon as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] (especially in youth leagues). UFC Lightweight Champion [[Conor McGregor]] is a more recent example of a prominent trash-talker, while former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Chael Sonnen]] is considered by some to be the greatest trash talker in [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/11/Sherdogs-Top-10-Trash-Talkers-86017|title=Sherdog’s Top 10: Trash Talkers - Number 1|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the practice of trying to distract opponents by verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their own terminology for verbal abuse: for example, [[cricket]] calls it [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]] and in ice hockey it is called chirping. Down Gaelic footballer Brendan Coulter has admitted to being targeted by sledging while on the field of play.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[The Wealdstone Raider]], a notorious fan hailing from Wealdstone, is known for trash-talking the opposition and opposition's fans.

==Smack talk==
{{Wiktionary|talk smack}}
'''Smack talk''' is a [[slang]] term seen in chat channels in [[chat room]], [[blog]], and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOG) conversations. The term came about in the early 1990s.  It generally refers to the use of threatening or intentionally inflammatory language. Smack talk can also be used with [[bullying]], whether that be [[face-to-face interaction]], or [[cyber-bullying]].

Smack talk is also a [[slang]] term used in [[sport]]s. It refers to inflammatory comments made by a person or team in order to insult, anger, annoy or be boisterous towards your opponents. Although it began as a term used by sports fans and athletes, it has spread to all areas of culture where competition takes place. In the [[United States of America|United States]], it is synonymous with "trash talk".

The social interaction within MMOGs has been observed to be quite active and often leads to long-term social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers'', CyberPsychology and Behavior, Volume 10, pp. 575-583, H. Cole and Griffiths, MD., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  MMOG groups, such as "teams", "guilds" or "corporations", are composed of groups of people who often initially have no other social contact or interactions with each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Study: Want to Make a Friend for Life? Play an MMORPG'', James Brightman, August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their conversations contain a subtext of discovery of language skills, social values, and intentions.  One of the first indicators of these is the use or offense taken by the usage of smack talk.  For the purpose of setting a social context or to comply with MMOG [[end user license agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/eula.html|title=Blizzard Entertainment:Blizzard Legal Documentation|website=www.worldofwarcraft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions, MMOG groups may establish bylaws, traditions, or rules (formal or informal) that either permit, discourage, or prohibit the use of smack talk in their conversations and postings.

The {{nihongo|'''''Ultra Series'''''|ウルトラシリーズ|Urutora Shirīzu}} is the collective name for all the shows produced by [[Tsuburaya Productions]] featuring [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]], his many brethren, and the myriad Ultra Monsters. The Ultra Series is one of the prominent [[tokusatsu]] superhero genre productions from Japan, along with [[Toei Company|Toei]] produced series ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and the ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Heroes]]''. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the ''daikaiju'' (大怪獣, "giant monster") genre, along with [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' series, and [[Daiei Film]]'s ''[[Gamera]]'' series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the ''kyodai hīro'' (巨大ヒーロー, "giant hero") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.

==The Ultramen==
{{Multiple issues|
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2017}}
}}
As revealed in ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'', the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They were evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]] and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the {{nihongo|Space Garrison|宇宙警備隊|Uchū Keibitai}} to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.

The Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or "warning lights", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.

Ultra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. As when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire, an Ultraman can be revived with a massive energy infusion. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.

==The Ultraman phenomenon==
The show ''[[Ultraman]]'' was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' (1967, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), ''[[The Return of Ultraman]]'' (1971, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Ace]]'' (1972, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'' (1973, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Leo]]'' (1974, TBS), ''[[Ultraman 80]]'' (1980, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'' (1996, [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]), ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'' (1997, MBS), ''[[Ultraman Gaia]]'' (1998, MBS), and ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' (2001, MBS). Recently the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the "Ultra N Project", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the "mascot" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as the final episode of ''Ultraman Nexus'') in late 2003, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]'' (2004, [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]]), and ''[[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]'' (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to old-school style series in the form of ''[[Ultraman Max]]'' (2005, CBC). In the course of the ''Max'' series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]'', which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: ''[[Ultraman Hikari]]'', formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.

The franchise has also been in the movie theaters, starting with ''[[Ultraman Zearth]]'' and ''Ultraman Zearth 2,'' ''[[Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey]],'' released in 2000, as well as ''ULTRAMAN,'' a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of ''[[Ultraman Neos]]'' in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The ''Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers'' movie opened in September 2006.

Foreign productions include the 1987 [[Hanna-Barbera]] co-production ''[[Ultraman: The Adventure Begins]]'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Ultraman USA''), an animated movie; ''[[Ultraman: Towards the Future]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Great''), an Australian 1991 production and ''[[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Powered''), produced in the [[United States]] in 1993. Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only ''Ultra Q'', the original ''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', ''Ultraman Great'' &amp; ''Ultraman Tiga'' were known to be translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Portuguese  (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' in [[Brazil]]), [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''Ultraman Tiga'', ''Ultraman Dyna'', ''Ultraman Gaia'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraman Max'' and ''Ultraman Mebius''). Also of note is the [[American English]] dub of ''Ultraman Tiga'' by [[4Kids Entertainment]] that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.

In 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and [[Toei Company]] co-produced ''[[Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider]],'' a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's ''[[Kamen Rider]]''. This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.

At present, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen. (The figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities—it has been revealed in ''Nexus'' that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts.) In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/pressrelease/130912-guinness/ |title="最も派生テレビシリーズが作られたテレビ番組"として『ウルトラマン』が世界記録に認定 &amp;#124; 株式会社 円谷プロダクション |publisher=Tsuburaya-prod.co.jp |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|title=Properties-Ultraman |website=4kidsentertainment.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228095359/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|archivedate=February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Malaysia]] banned the printing of an ''Ultraman'' book because it compared the character of Ultraman King (from the film ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'') with "[[Allah]]", the Arabic word for God, even though it is commonly used in [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] to refer to any "God". The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] stated that the comparison may "confuse Muslim children and damage their faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=A Japanese Superhero Is Apparently Destroying Malaysia|url=http://time.com/15265/ultraman-banned-malaysia-allah/|website=Time|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Ultraman Ginga S: Showdown! Ultra 10 Warriors!!]]'' and ''[[Ultraman X: Here It Comes! Our Ultraman]]'' were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. ''Ultraman Max'', ''Ultraman 80'', ''Ultraman Neos'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraseven X'', ''The Ultraman'' and more series began airing in the United States on the [[Toku (TV network)|TOKU]] channel.

At the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the [[Ultraman (manga)|manga]] was planned for release in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Foywonder|title=Teaser Trailer for Ultraman CGI Anime Movie Coming in 2019|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/261737/teaser-trailer-ultraman-cgi-anime-movie-coming-2019/|website=Dread Central|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ultra multiverse==

}}
Although the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', and then again in ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'', when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film ''[[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial]]'' when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film ''[[Ultraman Saga]]'' takes place in four different universes.

=="Digital Ultra" Japanese DVD release==
In Japan, there have been several box sets that were released which would each contain a particular Ultra series. As of now,{{when|date=November 2015}} there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.

The following are the series which have been released as such:
*''Ultra Q''
*''Ultraman''
*''Ultra Seven''
*''Ultraman Jack''

The "Digital Ultra" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.

==Licensing rights dispute==
Ultraman's [[licensing]] rights outside [[Japan]] have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co Ltd) based in [[Thailand]]. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, ''[[The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army]]'' and ''[[Jumborg Ace &amp; Giant]]''—the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, [[Jumborg Ace]]—in 1974. [[Sompote Sands|Sompote Saengduenchai]], founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976, the late Noboru Tsuburaya, Eiji's son, who had died in 1995, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. The claim is rumored to have originated from a gamble held by a drunken Hajime Tsuburaya (Noboru's older brother) and Sompote Saengduenchai over the rights to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|title=【三代目】円谷皐【次男】|publisher=Uni.2ch.net|date=|accessdate=2015-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928175420/http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|archivedate=2015-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}

In spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed [[hanko (stamp)|hanko]] of the late Noboru Tsuburaya in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as ''[[Ultra Q]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q"'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven"'', and Tsuburaya Productions being called "Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.

In the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on the said edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.

After an 8-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (''[[Ultra Q]]'' through ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'') and ''[[Jumborg Ace]]'' outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of said shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.

Tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro, including the theatrical feature ''[[Ultraman the Next]],'' throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.

In 2005 the American company BCI Eclipse announced they had acquired the DVD rights to ''[[Ultraman]]'' from Chaiyo. A 3-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, and a second 3-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the original Japanese [[monaural]] dialogue track as well as the [[English language|English]]-dubbed version produced by [[United Artists]] for [[North America]]n syndication. At certain times, the English dialogue track switched over to the Japanese dialogue for small periods of time. This was because BCI had used audio from older recordings in which several scenes had to be cut or shortened for the American broadcast in order to fit running time constraints.  Tsuburaya Productions still held on to the complete original English dubbing materials, which they had obtained from a warehouse in 1997, and refused to provide them for BCI. (Contrary to BCI's statements, the original English dubs were complete and uncut, except for a small cut in the conclusion of Episode 36, "Gift From The Sky.")

During the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series he called "Project Ultraman", un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring his own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, [[Ekin Cheng]] to the project.

On August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to [[China]]. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened "The Ultraman Copyright Study Group" in response to the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|title=Ultraman in Dispute!|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/10/05/ultraman-in-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined [[Thai baht|THB]] 15,000,000 (approx. [[Japanese yen|JPY]] 50,904,959 or [[United States dollar|USD]] 428,673.50 c. April 2007) plus interest and attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: Court orders Tsuburaya Chaiyo and Chaiyo Productions to stop making a commercial profit from new Ultraman characters|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/04/06/2467559.htm|website=TMCnet.com|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/pda/business_30031118.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104172131/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/pda/business_30031118.html |archivedate=2016-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Project Ultraman" went on hiatus as a result of the ruling, which implied that although Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series, it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers, including the design. Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

On February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final ruling in Ultraman case|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|website=The Nation|accessdate=August 9, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215145850/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|archivedate=February 15, 2008|date=February 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THE NATION Published on October 7, 2010 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |title=Thai wins Ultraman copyright case in Tokyo |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104171724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |archivedate=January 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of the ''[[Dragon Force: So Long, Ultraman]]'' movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aiken|first1=Keith|title=Chinese Ultraman Movie Latest Chapter in Ongoing Rights Dispute|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2017/07/28/chinese-ultraman-movie-latest-chapter-in-ongoing-rights-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was "not authentic".&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2017/11/22/the-fate-of-ultraman-rights-tsuburaya-defeats-chaiyo-in-latest-court-battle/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-26/tsuburaya-productions-wins-case-for-ultraman-international-licensing-rights/.124333&lt;/ref&gt; Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute,&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2018/03/14/ultraman-rights-challenged-once-again-tsuburaya-productions-back-in-court/&lt;/ref&gt; on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/395&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">'''Wanda Webb Holloway''' (born 1954) is a woman from [[Channelview, Texas]], known for attempting to hire a hitman to kill the mother of her daughter's junior high school [[cheerleading]] rival. The plan ultimately failed when the man she asked to perform the hit turned her in to the authorities.

==Background==
Holloway had an intense desire for her daughter Shanna to be a cheerleader. In 1991,  when Shanna narrowly missed out on a spot on her junior high school squad, Holloway asked her ex-brother-in-law, Terry Harper, to hire a [[hitman]] to kill Verna Heath, mother of the 14-year-old girl who had beaten her into the squad. Holloway believed that Heath's daughter would be so devastated by her mother's death that she would drop out of the cheerleading team, thereby giving the spot to Shanna. 

However, unknown to Holloway, Harper had gone straight to the police after Holloway approached him; she was arrested the next day.

==First trial==
Key evidence in the case for the prosecution, headed by Mike Anderson, came down to tapes provided by Terry Harper along with his testimony. These tapes revealed the words of Holloway offering her diamond earrings in exchange for never seeing Verna Heath in Channelview again. The defense lawyer, Troy McKinney, argued that Holloway’s ex-husband, Tony Harper, had conspired with his brother to frame Holloway. McKinney pointed to the divorce between Tony Harper and Wanda Holloway in 1980 and an ensuing custody battle over their children. 

Holloway was convicted of [[solicitation]] of [[capital murder]] in the 1991 trial and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.  However, the conviction was overturned when it was discovered one of the jurors was on [[probation]] for a drug-related felony and should have never been allowed to serve on the jury; a mistrial was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3484/Wanda-Holloway-Trial-1991-Plea-Agreement-Ends-Second-Trial.html |title=Wanda Holloway Trial: 1991 - Plea Agreement Ends Second Trial |last=Smith |first=Tom |access-date= October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second trial==
Holloway hired a new defense lawyer, Jack Zimmerman. This time Wanda Holloway admitted to the crime, pleading "no contest" (''[[nolo contendere]]''), and Zimmerman successfully negotiated a plea deal for Holloway.

On September 9, 1996, state district court judge George Godwin sentenced Holloway to ten years in prison, with a fine of $10,000.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|last=Pesce|first=Carolyn|title='Pompon mom' gets 15 years|newspaper=USA Today|date= September 2, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, Holloway settled a civil suit filed by the Heath family. On October 2, 1994, Holloway agreed to pay a total of $150,000 to the victims. It was decided in court that $70,000 would be given to Verna and her husband, $30,000 to the children of Verna, and $50,000 to cover the legal expenses of the case.

==Early release==
Holloway was released on March 1, 1997 after serving just six months of her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title=Deadly rivals agree payout|newspaper=The Times|date=October 7, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge ordered her to serve the remaining 9.5 years on probation, and to complete 1,000 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Koiden|url=http://www.texnews.com/texas97/mom030197.html|title='Cheerleader mom' freed after serving six months|newspaper=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|date=March 1, 1997|accessdate=May 26, 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090811085108/http://texnews.com/texas97/mom030197.html|archivedate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What's On''''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]]: '''熒幕八爪娛''') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] weekly half-hour [[infotainment]] TV program that airs on [[Fairchild TV]].

==Format==

Originally started in 1996, the program is currently the longest-running program in Fairchild Television history. ''What's On'' is a 30-minute informative program that introduces viewers to events happening in and around [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]].  It also runs short interviews with local celebrities, politicians and social figures for events they are contributing to, as well as interviews with international celebrities as they arrive in the city to promote or to perform.

Originally, there were two versions of the program. The Vancouver version and Toronto version ran in the same time slot in their respective cities on Thursday nights at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. while the version of the opposite city ran on Saturdays at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. However, because of the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]]'s ruling requiring Fairchild TV to air the same programming throughout the country, the two programs combined into one in July 2001 with each city getting 15 minutes of airtime. This also meant the start of the "interactive" format of the program where the hosts from the two cities shared a brief interaction as the scenes change from one city to another.

In November 2002, Fairchild Television moved the program from its Thursday timeslot to its current Sunday at 7:30pm time.

==Past and current hosts==

''What's On'' is seen as a training ground for a lot of Fairchild Television personalities.  The following is a partial list of past and present hosts for the program:

[[Image:Ixion.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|[[José Ribera]]'s grittily realistic ''Ixion'', 1632 ([[Museo del Prado]]).]]

In a [[literary]] context, a '''wheel of fire''' may refer to the chain of tortuous or dire consequences that result from a single action.

==In mythology==
The Wheel of Fire originates in [[Greek mythology|Greek mythology]] as the punishment for [[Ixion]], who was bound to a wheel of fire for lusting after [[Zeus]]'s wife, [[Hera]].

==In literature==
The Wheel of Fire is part of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] reading of a [[tragedy]] (e.g., plays), which includes the central [[character flaw|flaw]] within a character. In Shakespeare's tragedy ''[[Othello]]'', the flaw in [[Othello (character)|Othello himself]] is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe [[Iago]], who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur.

The Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the [[protagonist]] within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as ''[[catharsis]]''), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance.

The Wheel of Fire is also the title of [[G. Wilson Knight]]'s book on Shakespearean tragedy.

In Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', Lear states: "But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead".{{OR|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===In Tolkien===
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the [[One Ring]] is described as a "wheel of fire".

:"I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire." -- [[Frodo Baggins]] speaking to [[Samwise Gamgee]].

Also: "A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire." -- A description of [[Gollum]] and Frodo, respectively, as seen by Samwise.

The '''Wolf System''' was founded in 1988 by fight [[choreographer]] and [[stage combat]]/[[martial arts]] instructor  Tony Wolf. It has been applied to a range of production genres including professional [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[motion capture]], notably including ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, as well as to [[physical theater]], martial arts and [[self defense]] training.

== History ==

The Wolf System (under the name "Re:Action") was originally a collection of techniques adapted from [[professional wrestling]], [[historical fencing]], [[mime]] and various [[martial arts]] styles.  Over time, and due in part to the pedagogical influence of the [[modern dance]] discipline of [[contact improvisation]] and of the Russian martial art of Ryabko [[Systema]], the Wolf system's emphasis shifted from a curriculum of specific techniques to an open-ended progression of largely improvised training [[game]]s and [[exercises]].

The system was first introduced to the international community at the Paddy Crean International Stage Combat Conferences held at the [[Banff Centre]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], in 1998.  Since that time, aspects of the system have been taught to [[actor]]s, [[Theatre director|directors]], martial artists, [[dancers]], [[choreographers]] and [[stunt]] performers throughout [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], Canada and the [[United States|U.S.]], as well as at master-class seminars in [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].

== Philosophy and pedagogy ==

The Wolf System is designed to teach a series of fundamental [[motion (physics)|movement]] and/or [[performance]] skills. 

The skills are divided into the following categories:

'''Synergy''' - non-verbal, especially [[Touch|tactile]] responsiveness and communication 

'''Articulation''' - cycles of preparation, action and reaction in performing stage combat techniques, both for the safety of the performers and for clarity of live or on-camera performance

'''Illusion''' - methods of misdirection and of concealing certain safety measures from the audience or camera to preserve the [[illusion]] of actual [[combat]]

'''Alignment''' - methods of skeletal alignment supported by muscular control as used in maintaining balance and in supporting another person's body weight

'''Extension''' - methods of projecting momentum

'''Cascade''' - methods of safely moving from a standing position to the floor by collapsing or rolling 

'''Measure''' - methods of judging the active distance between oneself and another person

Of the above list, both Articulation and Illusion are specific to the use of the Wolf System in stage combat training. The two fundamental premises of the Wolf System in stage combat are defined as Safety and Storytelling, both with reference to performance combat as a skill of theatrical illusion.

Some of the games and exercises may be performed individually while others may be performed in pairs or by groups of up to twenty people.  

Participants in this form of training constantly alternate between co-operating and competing with their partner(s) during different exercises. [[Co-operative]] games require the participants to work together to achieve a specific result, such as balancing against each other's bodies while in physically awkward positions or keeping their hands in contact while performing various improvised movement exercises.  [[Competitive]] games require the participants to work against each other, as in contests of balance and speed.

Participants also alternate between moving "in character" and as themselves, between improvised and choreographed exercises and between assuming active and passive [[roles]] during the various exercises.

To perform Wolf System exercises with a partner or in a group environment is known as [[Jam session|jamming]], a term borrowed from contact improvisation and from [[jazz]].

The Wolf System can be used to introduce [[combative]] concepts and skills to students who may not have any previous background in fencing, martial arts or related disciplines.  Also, the open-ended nature of the exercises allow participants to experiment with a wide range of unusual fighting techniques and styles, including many that are not typically offered in more orthodox stage combat or martial arts training programs.

The '''XFL''' was a professional [[American football]] league that played its only season in 2001. As originally conceived, the XFL was operated as a joint venture between the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now known as WWE) and [[NBC]]. The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would take place during the [[National Football League|NFL]] off-season, and was promoted as having fewer rules and encouraging rougher play than other major leagues. The league had eight teams in two divisions, including major markets and those not directly served by the NFL, such as Birmingham, Las Vegas, Memphis, and Orlando. The XFL operated as a single entity (unlike most other professional sports leagues, which operate under the franchise model), with all teams centrally owned by the league.

Co-owner NBC served as the main broadcaster of XFL games, along with [[UPN]] and [[Paramount Network|TNN]]. The presentation of XFL games featured [[sports entertainment]] elements inspired by [[professional wrestling]], including [[heat (wrestling)|heat]] and [[kayfabe]] (although the games and their outcomes were legitimate), suggestively-dressed [[cheerleader]]s, and occasional usage of WWF personalities (such as [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Jim Ross]], and [[Jerry Lawler]]) as part of on-air commentary crews alongside sportscasters and veteran football players. The telecasts also featured extensive usage of aerial [[skycam]]s and on-player microphones to provide additional perspectives of the games.

The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected, but ratings quickly nosedived. The league garnered a negative reputation due to its connections to professional wrestling and the WWF, the overall quality of play, and a presentation that differed starkly from network football telecasts of the era (albeit with technical and on-air innovations that would later become commonplace). [[Lorne Michaels]], executive producer of NBC's long-running ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', was also critical of the XFL when a game going into double overtime caused the show to be delayed until after midnight on the east coast (prompting moves to speed up play, if not pre-empt the conclusion of a game entirely if it did not finish by a specific time, in order to minimize disruptions to ''SNL'').

NBC and the WWF both lost $35 million on their $100 million investment in the league's inaugural season. Although committing to broadcast two seasons, NBC [[cancellation (television)|pulled out of its broadcast contract]] for the XFL after the inaugural season, citing the poor viewership. While WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] initially stated that the XFL would continue without NBC, and proposed the addition of expansion teams, unfavorable demands of the league by UPN hastened the XFL's demise, and the league ceased operations entirely in May 2001 a month after the championship game. The [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] were the XFL's first and only champions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105859/http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/ |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/05/11/0511topnews.html |title=Top Of The News: XFL Exterminated |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, LLC|date= |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon conceded that the league was a "colossal failure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77582/516-this-day-in-history.html?p=1|title=5/16 This day in history|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=May 16, 2013|publisher=PWInsider|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon maintained control of the XFL brand after the league ceased operations, and on January 25, 2018, he announced [[XFL (2020)|the return of the XFL]] with a target relaunch date of 2020. The revival will be owned by McMahon's Alpha Entertainment, a company separate from WWE.

==Founding==
Created as a 50–50 joint venture between [[NBC]] and WWF-owned subsidiary WWE Properties International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/otherfb/news/2001/0327/1163009.html |title=DeVito says NBC not necessary for next year |date=March 27, 2001 |newspaper=[[ESPN]]  |publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the company name "XFL, LLC", the XFL was created as a "[[entity|single-entity league]];" instead of the [[sports franchising|franchise model]] used by the NFL and other major leagues, or the hybrid model where investors in the league are given operations over teams (as used in [[Major League Soccer]]), the XFL uniformly owned and operated all of its teams as one corporation, with no individual owners. [[Vince McMahon]]'s original plan was to purchase the [[Canadian Football League]] (after the CFL initially approached him about purchasing the [[Toronto Argonauts]]) and "[[Canadian Football League in the United States|have it migrate south]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania23/2007/03/29/3862428.html |title=Vince McMahon Q&amp;A |first=Tim |last=Baines |publisher=Canoe |agency=''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NBC, who had lost their long-held broadcast rights to the NFL's [[American Football Conference|American Football Conference (AFC)]] to [[CBS]] in 1998, was moving ahead with [[Time Warner]] to create a football league of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/129418/time-warner-and-nbc-to-form-new-pro-league |title=Time Warner and NBC to Form New Pro League |publisher=SportBusiness |date=September 28, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826132230/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/129418/time-warner-and-nbc-to-form-new-pro-league |archivedate=26 August 2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}} (Note: the article, despite the 2001 date, was written in 1998. See also: "[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20352535.html TNT, NBC consider new football league]")&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the league was first announced by league commissioner Tyler Schueck on February 3, 2000. The XFL was originally conceived to build on the success of the NFL and [[professional wrestling]]. It combined the scoring system of the NFL with the [[kayfabe]] and stunts of the [[WWE|WWF]]. As WWF was, at the time, in the midst of its [[Attitude Era]], the XFL's presentation likewise would reflect that approach toward football, with its emphasis on sex and violence. It was hyped as "real" football without penalties for roughness and with fewer rules in general. The games would feature players and coaches with microphones and cameras in the huddle and in the [[locker room]]s. Stadiums featured [[trash-talk]]ing public address announcers and scantily-clad [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s who were encouraged to date the players. Instead of a pre-game coin toss, XFL officials put the ball on the ground and let a player from each team scramble for it to determine who received the kickoff option. The practice was dubbed "The Human Coin Toss" by commentators, and one player famously separated his shoulder on the first scramble, missing the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/this-is-the-xfl-again-controversial-football-league-set-to-return-in-2020/|title=This is the XFL, again: Controversial football league set to return in 2020|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XFL featured extensive television coverage, with three games televised each week on [[NBC]], [[UPN]], and [[Spike (TV channel)#The National Network and The New TNN (2000–2003)|TNN]]. To accommodate this, it placed four of its teams in the four largest U.S. media markets: [[New York metropolitan area|New York City/North Jersey]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Greater Los Angeles]] (this was during the [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|NFL's 21-year absence from the Los Angeles metro area]]). The remaining four teams were placed in markets that had previously hosted teams in second-tier and/or rival major leagues: Birmingham, Memphis, Las Vegas, and Orlando. All of the XFL's markets except Las Vegas had hosted teams in the [[United States Football League]] in the 1980s; Las Vegas, along with Birmingham and Memphis, had hosted short-lived CFL teams in the 1990s.

The XFL chose unusual names for its teams, most of which either referenced images of uncontrolled insanity ([[Memphis Maniax|Maniax]], [[Orlando Rage|Rage]], [[Los Angeles Xtreme|Xtreme]], [[San Francisco Demons|Demons]]) or criminal activity ([[Chicago Enforcers|Enforcers]], [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen|Hitmen]], [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Outlaws]], and the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts|Birmingham Blast]]). After outrage from Birmingham residents who noted that Birmingham had a history of notorious "blasts", including the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in 1963 and [[Eric Rudolph]]'s 1998 bombing of a local abortion clinic, the XFL changed the name of the Birmingham team to the more benign "Birmingham Thunderbolts" (later shortened to "Bolts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolts for short |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 25, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010185318/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, the "X" in XFL did not stand for "extreme", as in "eXtreme Football League".{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=9}} When the league was first organized in 1999, it was originally supposed to stand for "Xtreme Football League"; however, there was already a league in formation at the same time with that name, and so promoters wanted to make sure that everyone knew that the "X" did not actually stand for anything (though McMahon would comment that "if the NFL stood for the 'No Fun League', the XFL will stand for the 'e'''x'''tra '''f'''un '''l'''eague'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/sports/sports-business-wwf-alters-script-and-looks-to-football.html |work=[[The New York Times]]  |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|title=SPORTS BUSINESS; W.W.E. Alters Script and Looks to Football |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |date=4 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The other Xtreme Football League, which was also organized in 1999, merged with the [[Arena Football League]]'s minor league [[AF2]] before ever playing a single game.

==Draft==

The only main draft for the league took place over a three-day period from October 28, 2000 to October 30, 2000. A total of 475 players were selected initially, with 65 additional players then selected in a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000.

==2001 season==
[[File:XflNight.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Chicago Enforcers]] XFL game at [[Soldier Field]]]]

===On the field===
The XFL's opening game took place on February 3, 2001, one year after the league was announced, less than one week following the NFL's [[Super Bowl]]. The first game was between the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] and the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

The league's regular season structure was set up so that each team played teams in its own division twice in the season, home and away (the same as the [[National Football League]]) and played against teams in the other division once. The season ran ten weeks, with no [[bye (sports)|bye weeks]].

The league's western division was far more competitive than the east, with the four teams' records ranging from 7–3 (for eventual champion Los Angeles) to 4–6 (Las Vegas, who finished last after losing its last three games to end up one game out of a playoff spot). In the East, New York and Chicago both were hampered by slow starts and ineffective starters before making personnel changes that improved their play, while Orlando, under quarterback [[Jeff Brohm]], who owned the league's highest QB rating at 99.9 during the 2001 XFL season, soared to first place, winning its first six games before Brohm suffered a career-ending injury and the team regressed (the team went 2–2 in his absence). Birmingham started the season 2–1 before a rash of injuries (and tougher competition, as its two wins were against New York and Chicago) led to the team losing the last seven games. Injuries were a major problem across the league: only three of the league's eight Opening Day starting quarterbacks&amp;nbsp;—Los Angeles's [[Tommy Maddox]], San Francisco's [[Mike Pawlawski]] and Memphis's [[Jim Druckenmiller]]—were still starters by the end of the season. Birmingham and Las Vegas were both on their third-string quarterbacks by the end of the ten-week season.

The top two teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. To avoid teams having to play each other three times in a season, the league set up the semifinal round of the playoffs so that the games would feature teams from opposite divisions: the east division champion (Orlando) hosted the west division runner-up (San Francisco), and likewise for the west champion and east runner-up (Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively). Los Angeles and San Francisco each won their playoff games to advance to the [[Million Dollar Game|XFL championship]].

===Off the field===
The opening game ended with a 19–0 victory for the Outlaws, and was watched on NBC by an estimated 14 million viewers. During the telecast, [[NBC]] switched over to the game between the [[Orlando Rage]] and the [[Chicago Enforcers]], which was a closer contest than the blowout taking place in Las Vegas. The opening night drew a 9.5 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]].{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=171}}

Although the opening-week games actually delivered ratings double those of what NBC had promised advertisers (and more viewers than the [[2001 Pro Bowl]]), the audience declined sharply to a 4.6 in just one week,{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} and eventually dropped to minuscule levels.

A further problem was that the XFL itself was the brainchild of Vince McMahon, a man who was ridiculed by mainstream sports journalists due to the stigma attached to [[professional wrestling]] as being "[[Work (professional wrestling)|fake]]"; many journalists even jokingly speculated whether any of the league's games were [[Match fixing|rigged]], although nothing of this sort was ever seriously investigated.

Even longtime NBC sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] joined in the mocking of the league. Dick Ebersol purposely allowed Costas and other NBC Sports veterans to opt out of the network's coverage of the league (hence with the exception of long-departed ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' analyst [[Mike Adamle]], its coverage was helmed mostly by younger unknowns and professional wrestling figures), and Costas in particular did not like McMahon's approach to the sport. In an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in February 2001, after the league's second week of play, Costas joked: "It has to be at least a decade since I first mused out loud, 'Why doesn't somebody combine mediocre [[high school football]] with a tawdry [[strip club]]?' Finally, somebody takes my idea and runs with it."&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, Tom, [http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/TOP-OF-THE-SIXTH-2952184.php Top of the Sixth], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' online edition (SFGate.com), February 15, 2001.  Retrieved May 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Costas interviewed McMahon for an episode of his [[HBO]] show ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas|On the Record]]'' as the league was in decline; McMahon's defiant attitude toward Costas was later cited as hastening the league's demise.

==XFL rule changes==
Despite boasts of a "rules-light" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played a brand of 11-man outdoor football that was recognizable,&lt;!-- Good writing, well done! --&gt; aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some modified during the season as it progressed. The league's coaches vetoed a proposal to eliminate ineligible receivers (allowing any player to receive a forward pass) midway through the season, on account that the change would be too radical.

===Grass stadiums===
The league deliberately avoided placing teams in stadiums with [[artificial turf]], which at the time had a bad reputation both for being unsightly as well as being more hazardous to play on compared to natural turf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xflboard.com/stadiums/index.htm List of stadiums] courtesy of xflboard.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The league's requirement for [[grass]] fields automatically ruled out the use of [[dome]]d stadiums since no such stadium capable of accommodating a grass football field existed in the U.S. in 2001 (the only [[retractable roof]] stadiums complete at the time were used exclusively for [[Major League Baseball]]; the first retractable roof stadium for NFL use was not completed until [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]] opened for the expansion [[Houston Texans]] in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]). Furthermore, every XFL field was designed identically, with no individual team branding on the field. Each [[end zone]] and 50-yard line was decorated with the XFL logo, with the endzones also being painted black.

Most of the league's stadiums were football-specific facilities, the only exception being San Francisco's [[Pacific Bell Park]] (home of the [[San Francisco Giants]]) which was built primarily for [[baseball]], but (unlike many newer baseball-specific stadiums) can accommodate football. Two XFL stadiums ([[Giants Stadium]] and [[Soldier Field]]) were also then-current NFL stadiums, while two others ([[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]) had previously hosted NFL games; the NFL would return to the Coliseum when [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] returned to Los Angeles in 2016. The remaining fields were in regular use as [[college football]] venues at the time.

The home team in every stadium was required to occupy the sideline opposite the press box in order to be visible to the television cameras. Due to the odd field dimensions in San Francisco, teams playing there were permitted to occupy the same sideline (a similar arrangement existed in the NFL when the [[Green Bay Packers]] played at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]).

The all-grass field stipulation caused the league to skip over several of the country's largest markets, including [[Houston]] and [[Philadelphia]], since they lacked a large grass stadium in 2001.&lt;!--Dallas had the Cotton Bowl and Detroit had Tiger Stadium--&gt; In the league's two northernmost markets, Chicago and New York/New Jersey (the latter of which played in [[Giants Stadium]] during a brief window in which the stadium's usual artificial turf had been replaced by natural grass), the combination of the all-grass requirement, midwinter playing season and the fact that the XFL followed shortly after the NFL had used both fields for a full season (in Giants Stadium's case, two full seasons, since the Giants and Jets shared the stadium; the Giants also hosted two playoff games following the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]]) caused significant damage to the playing fields; at Chicago's [[Soldier Field]], the wear and tear on the field was such that by midseason, the midfield logo of the Enforcers' cross-league rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] was clearly visible amid a stretch of dirt and dead grass.

Within a year of the XFL's demise, "next generation" artificial surfaces (which much more closely mimicked grass in appearance, feel and player safety) would be introduced in professional football. Giants Stadium would have a next generation artificial surface installed in 2003; Soldier Field was renovated extensively in 2002 but retained its grass field.

===Opening scramble===
Replacing the [[coin toss]] at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The XFL's first injury infamously resulted from the opening scramble; [[Orlando Rage|Orlando]] free safety [[Hassan Shamsid-Deen]] suffered a [[separated shoulder]] prior to the Rage's 33–29 season-opening win over the [[Chicago Enforcers]] at [[Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium]] on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/News/020401/Sports/League_starts_in_Orla.shtml Cotey, John C. "League starts in Orlando with pageantry, pain," ''St. Petersburg'' (FL) ''Times'', Sunday, February 4, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up missing the remainder of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.dailypress.com/2001-02-07/sports/0102070013_1_vince-mcmahon-xfl-danny-snyder-s-washington-redskins Hessler, Warner. "XFL Shocking? No More Than The Redskins," ''Daily Press'' (Hampton Roads, VA), Wednesday, February 7, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks===
After [[touchdown]]s there were no extra point kicks, due to the XFL's perception that an extra-point kick was a "guaranteed point." To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL [[two-point conversion]], but for just a single point). By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. However, touchdowns were still worth 6 points.

This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the [[World Football League|WFL]]'s "Action Point", and was identical to a 1968 "Pressure Point" experiment by the NFL and [[American Football League]], used only in preseason interleague games that year.

In 2015, the NFL, CFL and other professional leagues would address the "guaranteed point" concerns by moving the extra point kick back to the 15-yard and 25-yard lines, respectively, thus making the length of the kick the same distance (taking into account the NFL's position of the goalposts on the end line, and the CFL's goalposts being positioned on the goal line).

===Overtime===
Ties were resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and in the CFL today, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs&amp;nbsp;– teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT (similar to the rules of college football overtime). The process was repeated until a winner was determined&amp;nbsp;– unlike the CFL and NFL, but like college football, games could not end in ties even in the regular season.

===Bump and run===
The XFL allowed full [[bump and run coverage]] early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side.

Following the fourth week of the season, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL and CFL) in an effort to increase offensive production.

===Forward motion===
Unlike the [[National Football League|NFL]], but like the [[World Football League]] and [[Arena Football League]] before it&lt;!--NOT like Canadian football, which has totally different forward motion rules--&gt;, the XFL allowed one offensive player to [[motion (football)|move]] toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.

===Punting rules===
The XFL imposed a number of restrictions on [[punt (gridiron football)|punting]] that are not present in most other leagues' rules, the net effect of which made punts in the XFL operate under rules more akin to [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]]. The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. To this effect:

*Punting out of bounds was a ten-yard [[penalty (gridiron football)|penalty]], effectively outlawing the [[coffin corner punt]] commonplace at most other levels of the game.
*Any punt that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage could be [[onside kick|recovered by the kicking team]]. Thus, instead of letting the kicking team down the ball as is common in other leagues, the receiving team was required to try and return the punt or else lose possession.
*The kicking team was prohibited from coming within five yards of the [[punt returner]] before he gained possession of the ball. This rule, known as the halo rule in college football and also common in Canadian football, was dubbed the "danger zone" in the XFL. (Coming within five yards or less of this "danger zone" was a five-yard penalty, much in the same vein as the "no yards" penalty in Canadian football.)
*[[Fair catch]]es were not recognized. (The "no fair catch" rule was one of the most heavily hyped rule differences in the XFL and a central part of the league's marketing campaign, and like the above "no yards" penalty, fair catches were not recognized in Canadian football.)

For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.

Allowing the kicking team to recover a punt did encourage noticeably more [[quick kick]]s over the course of the XFL's lone season than was typically seen in the NFL over the preceding decades.

===Play clock===
The XFL used a 35-second [[play clock]], five seconds shorter than the contemporary NFL play clock of 40 seconds (but still longer than the CFL's 20 seconds), in an effort to speed up the game.

===Roster and salaries===
The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players, as opposed to 53 on [[National Football League|NFL]] teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters. This was similar to the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], which had a comparable 40-man roster limit in 2001.  This resulted, most commonly, in each team only carrying two quarterbacks and one kicker who doubled as the punter.

The XFL paid standardized player salaries. [[Quarterback]]s earned US$5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions ([[Los Angeles Xtreme]] players [[Noel Prefontaine]], the league's lone [[punter (football)|punting specialist]], and Matt Malloy, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a [[playoff game]]. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Players did not receive any fringe benefits, and had to pay for their own [[health insurance]].

===Jersey nicknames===
The XFL allowed its players to wear a nickname on the back of their jersey, as opposed to the legal last name most professional sports leagues have required since the 1960s. Players could change the nickname any time they wanted, and a few players chose to change the nicknames on a weekly basis depending on their opponent. (Two teams, Orlando&lt;ref name=letsplayfootball&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/story/sports/college/purdue/football/2017/07/27/lets-play-football-follows-purdues-jeff-brohm/514924001/|title=Jeff Brohm's XFL mic drop moment follows him to Purdue|work=Gannett News Service|first=Mike|last=Carmin|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Birmingham, imposed policies that forbade players from using nicknames.) The league's intent to use [[#Skycam and Bubba Cam|backfield camera angles]] gave these nicknames even greater exposure.

[[Rod Smart]], a running back who played in the first XFL nationally televised game, was the first player to gain notice from his nickname, "He Hate Me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/mlb-players-weekend-nickname-jerseys-age MLB's nickname gimmick won't solve baseball's mounting age issues]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved August 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fans love 'He Hate Me'"/&gt;

==Broadcast overview==

===Skycam and Bubba Cam===
Although the XFL was not the first football league to feature the "[[skycam|sky cam]]",&lt;ref name=skycam&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/07/sports/sp-22325|title=XFL, NBC Working Out Kinks|author=Larry Stewart|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 10, 2009|date=February 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enables TV viewers to see behind the offensive unit, it helped to popularize its unique capabilities. For the first several weeks, the league used the sky cam and on-field cameramen (nicknamed the "Bubba Cam" after WWE's cameraman, Bubba, who ironically refused to cover the XFL)&lt;ref name=skycam2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/05/16/Leagues-and-Governing-Bodies/XFL-Bubba-Cam.aspx|title=Bubba Cam put cameraman into the game|author=Terry Tefton|work=Sports Business Daily|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; extensively, giving the television broadcasts a perspective similar to [[video game]]s such as the ''[[Madden NFL|Madden]]'' series.

After the XFL's failure, the sky cam was adopted by the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s broadcasters; the device has subsequently come into use on all major networks. NBC in particular switched back to the XFL camera angles in [[2017 NFL season|2017]], when traditional cameras were too far away to cut through thick fog and smoke on some of the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games that year; response was so positive that the network opted to use two of its ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games to experiment with intentionally broadcasting most of the game through that angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2017/11/nbcs_skycam_will_provide_madde.html|title=NBC's 'SkyCam' will provide Madden-like view of tonight's Titans-Steelers game|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast schedule===
At the beginning of the season, NBC showed a feature game at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday nights, also taping a second game. The second game, in some weeks, would air in the visiting team's home market and be put on the air nationally if the feature game was a blowout (as was the case in week one) or encountered technical difficulties (as was the case in week two). Two games were shown each Sunday: one at 4 p.m. Eastern on [[Paramount Network#The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–2003)|TNN]] and another at 7 p.m. Eastern on [[UPN]]. The XFL also had a fairly extensive local radio presence, often using nationally recognized disc jockeys. The morning radio duo of [[Rick and Bubba]], for instance, was the radio broadcast team for the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts]]. [[Super Dave Osborne]] was a sideline reporter for Los Angeles Xtreme broadcasts on [[KAMP-FM|KLSX]]; [[WMVP]] carried Chicago Enforcers games.

Unusually for a professional league, the XFL did not feature a studio wraparound. The network offered ''XFL Gameday'', a pregame show featuring radio shock jocks [[Opie and Anthony]] for the first four weeks of the season, but the show was not carried nationwide and most affiliates joined in just before the game. Halftime consisted mostly of live look-ins into the player locker rooms, as coaches discussed their strategy and halftime adjustments with their players, as well as cheerleader performances. The XFL also, at McMahon's request, followed a somewhat different format than traditional professional football telecasts: the announcers more closely followed the model of professional wrestling where the [[color commentator]] had a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain-like role]], while the [[sideline reporter]]s (who were predominantly male, a rare example of the XFL being more ''conservative'' than the NFL at the time, which was incorporating attractive female sideline reporters) were former players and experienced sportscasters who were relied upon for more expert analysis than usual.

In the third week of the season, the games were sped up through changes in the playing rules, and broadcasts were subjected to increased time constraints. The reason was the reaction of [[Lorne Michaels]], creator and executive producer of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', to the length of the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] versus [[Chicago Enforcers]] game that went into double overtime. The double overtime periods combined with a power outage earlier in the game due to someone not fueling a generator before the game delayed the contest, causing the start of ''Saturday Night Live'' to be pushed back from 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time to 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Sunday morning.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} This angered Michaels, who expected high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with [[Jennifer Lopez]] as the show's host.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} For the rest of the season, the XFL cut off coverage at 11:00 Eastern Time, regardless of whether or not the game was over. NBC Sports has retained this policy for other sports it runs in Saturday night time slots since the XFL's closure; in 2018, [[2018 NHL Stadium Series|a National Hockey League telecast]] was cut off under similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/03/lights-temporarily-go-out-navy-stadium-delaying-play-between-capitals-maple-leafs/392928002/ | title=Lights temporarily go out at Navy stadium, delaying play between Capitals, Maple Leafs | publisher=USA Today | date= March 3, 2018 | accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of declining ratings, NBC and the XFL aggressively promoted that the week 6 game between the Orlando Rage and Las Vegas Outlaws would feature a behind-the-scenes visit into the locker room of the Rage's cheerleaders at halftime. The heavily promoted event was, in fact, a [[publicity stunt]]: instead of showing an entry into the room, viewers instead saw a [[sketch comedy|sketch]] in which the cameraman knocked himself unconscious by running into the locker room door, followed by a [[dream sequence]] with little implied nudity, various fetish-related scenes, and a surprise cameo from [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. The ''New York Daily News'' reported that the scene would likely be the "[last] salacious WWF-style stunt for the rest of the season", citing internal sources indicating that NBC wished to pivot  the telecasts back towards a football-oriented product, including hiring NFL alumni as analysts, and reinstating Vasgersian as the lead commentator.&lt;ref name="nydn-cheerleaders"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL stops going to extremes|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/xfl-stops-extremes-article-1.916919|website=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman|Daily News L.P.]]|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn-slidebarely"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL ends ratings slide&amp;nbsp;– just barely|url=http://www.espn.com/otherfb/xfl/news/2001/0311/1147486.html|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN Inc.|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=173}}

===Broadcast teams===
[[File:JR and The King No Mercy 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Jim Ross]] came over from WWE to fill similar roles on XFL broadcasts.]]
*'''NBC (national telecasts)''':
**Week 1, 6–10: [[Matt Vasgersian]], [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Mike Adamle]]. [[Chris Wragge]] replaced Roggin for at least Week 6.
**Week 2–5: [[Jim Ross]], Ventura, Roggin and Adamle
*'''NBC (regional telecasts)''':
**Week 1: Ross, [[Jerry Lawler]], [[Jonathan Coachman]]. For week 1, Ross and Lawler were billed as their WWE personas, "J.R." and "The King."
**Week 2–5: Vasgersian, Lawler, and Coachman. McMahon personally demoted Vasgersian to the regional telecast after openly criticizing a suggestive shot of the cheerleaders as "uncomfortable" on-air during the week 1 broadcast.
**Week 6–10: Ross, [[Dick Butkus]] and Coachman. Lawler left the XFL (and WWE) in protest after week five in the aftermath of the firing of his then-wife, [[Stacy Carter]], as well as his own dissatisfaction with being pressured into commentary on XFL games; Lawler openly admitted on-air that he had virtually no interest or background in football, an unusual trait for a color analyst. After Lawler's departure, NBC brought Vasgersian back up to the main broadcast team.
*'''TNN''': [[Craig Minervini]], [[Bob Golic]], [[Lee Reherman]] and Kip Lewis.
*'''UPN''': [[Chris Marlowe]], [[Brian Bosworth]], [[Chris Wragge]] and [[Michael Barkann]].

==Critical reception==
It was believed that the willingness of Las Vegas bookmakers to take bets on XFL games established their legitimacy, dispelling concerns that the league was using predetermined storylines as in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name="sentinel-betting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xfl Bets On Gambling To Bring Out Fans|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-03/news/0102030271_1_bookies-football-league-las-vegas|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mentalfloss-xfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Good, Honest Football: Re-Watching the XFL|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58829/good-honest-football-re-watching-xfl|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the league was panned by critics as boring football with a tawdry broadcast style, although the broadcasts on TNN and to a lesser extent UPN and the [[Matt Vasgersian]]–helmed NBC coverage were considered comparatively professional.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=59}}

==End of season and failure==

The WWF and NBC each lost a reported $35 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=105329 |title=XFL Is Down for the Count |date=May 11, 2001 |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[Disney-ABC Television Group]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; only recuperating 30% of their combined initial $100 million investment.&lt;ref name=skycam/&gt; On April 21, 2001, the season concluded as the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] defeated the [[San Francisco Demons]] 38–6 in the XFL Championship Game (which was originally given the moniker "The Big Game at the End of the Season", but was later dubbed the [[Million Dollar Game]], after the amount of money awarded to the winning team).

Though paid attendance at games remained respectable, if unimpressive (overall attendance was only 10% below what the league's goal had been at the start of the season), the XFL ceased operations after just one season due to low TV ratings.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE drops XFL|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/05/10/news/xfl/|work=[[CNNMoney]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=May 10, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=No More Springtimes for the XFL as League Folds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/sports/pro-football-no-more-springtimes-for-the-xfl-as-league-folds.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 11, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing stiff competition from the [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], the NBC telecast of the Chicago/NY-NJ game on March 31 received a 1.5 rating, at that time the lowest ever for any major network [[primetime]] weekend first-run sports television broadcast in the United States.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=211}}

Despite initially agreeing to broadcast XFL games for two years and owning half of the league, NBC announced it would not broadcast a second XFL season; the network no longer had a full season of Saturday nights to offer the league because it had acquired the rights to the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], even if the XFL had been more successful or profitable. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon initially announced that the XFL would continue, as it still had UPN and TNN as broadcast outlets.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=176}} In fact, expansion teams were being explored for cities such as Washington, D.C. and [[Detroit]]. However, in order to continue broadcasting XFL games, UPN demanded that ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'' broadcasts be cut from two hours to one and a half hours.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=176}} McMahon found these terms unacceptable and he announced the XFL's closure on May 10, 2001.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; McMahon's chief adviser, a perplexed Nathan Livian, was quoted as saying "the situation is, indeed, very bad".

One reason for the failure of the league to catch on, despite its financial solvency and massive visibility, was the lack of respect for the league in the sports media.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} XFL games were rarely treated as sports contests, but rather more like WWF-like sensationalized events. With few NFL-quality players, save [[Tommy Maddox]], the league's MVP, and with little thoughtful analysis or even consideration by sports columnists, the XFL never gained the necessary recognition to be regarded as a viable league. The fact that the league was co-owned by NBC made ESPN (which was part of the [[The Walt Disney Company|same corporation]] as ABC) and Fox Sports Net (owned by Fox TV) disinclined to report on the XFL, though [[Time Warner]] properties such as ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', as well as the [[Associated Press]], devoted coverage to the league (''Sports Illustrated'' even [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|featured the XFL on the cover]] of its February 12, 2001, edition, albeit with the description of it being "sleazy gimmicks and low-rent football"). Many local TV newscasts and newspapers (even in XFL cities) did not report league scores or show highlights. This led to many football fans treating the XFL as a joke, rather than competition to the NFL.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other problems included the scantily-clad cheerleaders, trash-talking announcers, and the lack of penalties for roughness.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The XFL ranked No. 3 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the TV Guide's worst TV shows of all time in July 2002, as well as No. 2 on [[ESPN]]'s list of biggest flops in sports, behind [[Ryan Leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/12/entertainment/main515057.shtml|title=The Worst TV Shows Ever|author=Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2010-07-27|date=2002-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/25biggestflops|title=ESPN 25: The 25 Biggest Sports Flops|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Inc.|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[TV Guide Network]] also listed the show at No. 21 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News&amp;nbsp;– TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=March 2, 2010|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories recapping the history of the XFL show photos of the crash of its promotional blimp in [[Oakland, California]], portraying it retrospectively as an ill-omen for the league. The incident occurred a month before the opening game on Tuesday, January 9, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 10, 2001|title=XFL'S UNPLANNED TOUCHDOWN / Wayward blimp's wild, woolly flight ends in Oakland crash|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/XFL-S-UNPLANNED-TOUCHDOWN-Wayward-blimp-s-wild-2966749.php|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 10, 2001|title=Crash Mouth Football: XFL Promo Blimp In Bay Area Deflates|publisher=Sports Business Daily|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2001/01/Issue-76/Sponsorships-Advertising-Marketing/Crash-Mouth-Football-XFL-Promo-Blimp-In-Bay-Area-Deflates.aspx|newspaper=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blimp was in Oakland as the league had flown it over the [[2000–01 NFL playoffs#AFC: Oakland Raiders 27, Miami Dolphins 0|January 6 playoff game]] between the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] and intended to do the same with the following week's AFC Championship, also in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Martin J. |last2=Kiger |first2=Patrick J. |date=2006 |title=Oops: 20 Life Lessons from the Fiascoes That Shaped America |location=New York |publisher=Collins |page=218 |isbn=0-06-078083-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots lost control of the airship and were forced to evacuate. The ground crew were unable to secure the vehicle and the "unattended blimp then floated five miles north over the Oakland Estuary, at one point reaching 1,600 feet, until its gondola caught on a sailboat mast in the Central Basin marina. It draped over the roof of the Oyster Reef restaurant—next to where the boat was moored—and a nearby power line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 31, 2001|title=Blimp crashes into Oakland restaurant|newspaper=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Inc.|agency=Associated Press|url=http://espn.go.com/moresports/news/2001/0110/1005983.html|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the pilot was hospitalized, no other major injuries were reported. The blimp needed $2.5 million in repairs, the sailboat and restaurant had only minor damages.

Before the season started, a fictional XFL game appeared in the 2000 film ''[[The 6th Day]]'', set in 2015.&lt;ref name="ABready"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL Ready To Line It Up|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4474381-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206135623/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4474381-1.html|archivedate=December 6, 2007|date=January 19, 2001|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
NBC continued airing professional league football beyond the demise of the XFL, starting with the [[Arena Football League]] [[AFL on NBC|television coverage from 2003 to 2006]]. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], NBC returned to coverage of NFL games with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'', eventually adding ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' to its coverage in [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. McMahon and Ebersol later took credit for the more intimate approach to televising football, with innovations such as the Skycam, miked-up players, and sideline interviews that were later used in NFL broadcasts.

XFL team names and logos sometimes appear in movies and television where professional football needs to be dramatized, as licensing for NFL logos may be cost prohibitive (such as in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] starring sci-fi film ''[[The 6th Day]]'').&lt;ref name="ABready" /&gt;

The [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]] later placed all four of its inaugural franchises in former XFL markets and stadiums. However, the UFL drew far fewer fans than the XFL average: for example, the XFL's [[San Francisco Demons]] drew an average of 35,000 fans, while the UFL's [[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]] drew an average of 6,000, despite both playing in the same ballpark. Three of the four charter teams, including the Redwoods, moved to other markets by the time of the UFL's [[2011 UFL season|third season]].

[[ESPN]] produced a [[documentary film|documentary]] surrounding the league, ''This Was the XFL'', as part of its anthology series ''[[30 for 30]]''. The film discusses the longtime friendship between McMahon and Ebersol, as seen through the eyes of Dick's son, [[Charlie Ebersol]], who directs the film. McMahon, Dick Ebersol, Dick Schanzer, [[Rusty Tillman]], [[Al Luginbill]], [[Rod Smart]], [[Tommy Maddox]], [[Paris Lenon]], league President Basil DeVito, costume designer Jay Howarth, [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Matt Vasgersian]], [[Jonathan Coachman]], [[Bob Costas]] and [[Jerry Jones]] all provided interviews for the film. It debuted at [[Doc NYC]] November 11, 2016, and premiered on ESPN on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref name="avclub-3030xfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=30 For 30 shrugs at the train wreck that was the XFL|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/30-30-shrugs-train-wreck-was-xfl-249297|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable players==
Notable players included league [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] and Los Angeles quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]], who signed with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] after the XFL folded (Maddox later became the starting quarterback for the Steelers in 2002 and led them to that year's playoffs, as well as continuing to start for them into 2004). Los Angeles used the first pick in the [[2001 XFL Draft|XFL draft]] to select a former [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback, Scott Milanovich. Milanovich lost the starting quarterback job to Maddox, who was placed on the Xtreme as one of a handful of players put on each team due to geographic distance between the player's college and the team's hometown. Another of the better-known players was Las Vegas [[running back]] [[Rod Smart]], who first gained popularity because the name on the back of his jersey read "[[Rod Smart#"He Hate Me"|He Hate Me]]."{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=89}} Smart, who was only picked 357th in the draft, later went on to play for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Carolina Panthers]], [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the CFL. His Panther teammate [[Jake Delhomme]] named his newborn horse "She Hate Me" as a reference to him.&lt;ref name="Fans love 'He Hate Me'"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=203873 JS Online: Fans love 'He Hate Me'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513000000/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=203873 |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart played in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] becoming one of seven XFL players to play in a Super Bowl.  Receiver [[Yo Murphy]] also achieved this as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] along with winning the 95th [[Grey Cup]] with the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619052630/http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm |date=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy Maddox played for a Super Bowl team (with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]) in [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit]], (although Maddox, by then a third-string quarterback, did not play in the game, which turned out to be his last appearance in uniform before retiring). Lastly, Las Vegas Outlaws DB [[Kelly Herndon]] played in [[Super Bowl XL]] with the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in 2005, where he is remembered for intercepting a pass and returning it a then-record 76 yards.  Although he did not play for an NFL team after the XFL's lone season, former Las Vegas Outlaw offensive guard [[Isaac Davis (American football)|Isaac Davis]] also had a notable NFL career, playing in 58 games over a six-year career.  Davis started for the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[Super Bowl XXIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/isaacdavis/gamelogs?id=DAV484459&amp;season=1994|title=Isaac Davis: Game Logs at NFL.com|website=www.nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Avery (American football)|John Avery]] went on to play for both the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and the [[Toronto Argonauts]] where he was an All Star selection in 2002 and won a [[Grey Cup]] in 2004.

The last active player to have played in the XFL is Canadian placekicker [[Paul McCallum (Canadian football)|Paul McCallum]], who retired as a member of the [[BC Lions]] prior to the start of the [[2016 CFL season]], but returned to the team as their place kicker during the final regular season game of the 2016 season.

==Current status and planned revival==
{{main|XFL (2020)}}
XFL games are now part of the [[WWE Video Library]].

In September 2012, WWE attempted to file a new XFL trademark for use in wrestling and football which was previously filed in 2009 under XFL LLC. The application is still pending since WWE has not put together a "Statement of Use" for the trademark. WWE could consider abandoning the old application and filing the new one under WWE Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/254196/Various-News:--XFL-Back-in-the-News,-Chris-Jericho,-and-More.htm |title=Various News: XFL Back in the News, Chris Jericho, and More |publisher=411MANIA |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the XFL's first trademark extension was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/xfl-85720169.html |title=XFL&amp;nbsp;– Reviews &amp; Brand Information&amp;nbsp;– World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

On December 15, 2017, it was reported that McMahon was seriously considering a revival of the XFL. WWE didn't confirm or deny the rumors, but released a statement that McMahon is launching a new company known as Alpha Entertainment, that is looking to expand into sports and entertainment properties "including professional football", and that WWE itself wasn't returning to professional football.&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/will-the-xfl-actually-be-making-a-return-wwe-is-not-exactly-denying-the-rumors|title=Will the XFL actually be making a return? WWE is not exactly denying the rumors|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted wrestling journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] speculated that McMahon was starting a [[shell corporation]] with his own money to protect WWE shareholders on a potential XFL revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvzE1vfnrP8|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of the XFL would air either on traditional TV or the [[WWE Network]], and would be toned down compared to its original incarnation due to [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] concerns in football that surfaced in the early 2010s.&lt;ref name="revival" /&gt; On December 22, 2017, McMahon sold $100 million worth of WWE shares, which required notification to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]; the SEC reported that it was done so that McMahon could fund Alpha Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/12/21/vince-mcmahon-sells-100-million-of-wwe-stock-as-xfl-reboot-plan-continues/|title=Vince McMahon sells $100 million of WWE stock as XFL reboot plan continues|date=21 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE shares did in fact decline slightly due to the report, with [[Citigroup]] downgrading WWE shares from "buy" to "neutral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2017/12/22/wwe-stock-falls-after-ceo-mcmahon-sells-shares|title=WWE Stock Falls After CEO McMahon Sells Shares  - Schaeffer's Investment Research|first=Josh|last=Selway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2018, Alpha Entertainment announced an [[XFL (2020)|XFL revival]] planned for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22211134/wwe-vince-mcmahon-try-launch-professional-football-league|title=Source: WWE's McMahon eyes football league|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22213241/vince-mcmahon-gimmick-free-xfl-return-2020|title=McMahon: Gimmick-free XFL to return in 2020|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">A '''Zoo Key''' is a key that activates talking storybook &lt;!-- trademark? --&gt; boxes located throughout a [[Zoo|zoological garden]].  The story recordings provide an [[audio tour]] of the zoo.

==Origin==
Talking Storybooks and Magic Keys were first used in [[Children's Fairyland]] in [[Oakland, California]]. Invented by Bruce Sedley, the original elephant-shaped novelty key was patented in 1960 (patent #188,343),&lt;ref name="patent_key"/&gt; and the story book system was patented in 1962 (patent #3,059,069).&lt;ref name="patent_storybook"/&gt;

On 26 August 2009, Bruce Sedley - aka the Skipper - and his dapper puppet friend King Fuddle handed out the millionth Magic Key to one golden child on Puppet Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoo Keys|url=http://zookeys.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}
 
As of late October 2012, Children's Fairyland began offering pewter and 23k Gold plated pewter Magic Keys as well as the standard plastic Magic Key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Fairyland facebook page|url=http://www.facebook.com/melancholyfae/posts/10200239969702576?comment_id=5796651#!/photo.php?fbid=10151129875389607&amp;set=a.309036309606.146650.185741704606&amp;type=1&amp;theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;
