'''''A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression''''' is a non-fiction book by the economist [[Richard Posner]]. The text was initially published on May 1, 2009 by [[Harvard University Press]]. Posner criticizes President [[George W. Bush]] and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-140, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; and moves away from his past well-known advocacy of [[free-market capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Baram" /&gt;  The book has been primarily noted not for his criticism of [[progressivism|progressive]] government policies (which he attacks again for good measure), but rather his critique of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and its ideologues.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

The book has been received with generally good reviews from the press, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Rauch"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/books/review/Rauch-t.html | accessdate = September 1, 2009 | work=The New York Times | first=Jonathan | last=Rauch | title=Capitalism's Fault Lines | date=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the reception has not been universally positive.&lt;ref name="Solow" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The primary argument of the book is that we have gone from a [[recession]] into a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] (the "D" word, as one author calls it)&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt; in 2009, and Posner suggests several possible short-term and long-term solutions to this fiscal crisis.  His thesis is not that government, politicians, or even bankers primarily caused this depression, but rather that the capitalist system is to blame for its own faults.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;"Seven questions for Richard Posner," Interview with Richard Posner, ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 June 2009, found at [https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/06/seven_questions_for_richard_po.cfm ''The Economist'' website]. Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt;

Some of the causes of the depression that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable [[usury]] laws, which would discourage risky loans,&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 291"&gt;Posner, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and central banks taking risks,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 45-46, 130"&gt;Posner, pp. 45-46, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; securitization of [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; illiquidity and insolvency of the banking system,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 41, 63-70, 128, 133, 201 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt; the housing bubble,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 77-78"&gt;Posner, pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; blindness to warning signs of a crisis,&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 118-138"&gt;Posner, pp. 118-138.&lt;/ref&gt; and the preconceptions of ideology.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316"&gt;Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner wraps up the book with a chapter containing several suggestions, including eventual re-regulation of the banking industry,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 289-291.&lt;/ref&gt; but warns that "this is not the time" to do so — a long-term solution after the economy recovers&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 291, see also pp. 291, 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt; — that can "wait calmer days."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggests putting off reorganization of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve until a later time.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 291-293, 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meanwhile, he writes, "piecemeal reforms may be feasible and helpful."&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 296"&gt;Posner, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;  These include a halt on government marketing of home ownership,&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 296"/&gt; requiring banks and financial institutions to "disclose the ''full'' compensation of all senior executives",&lt;ref&gt;(''Emphasis in the text'') Posner, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; backloading of compensation,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing marginal [[income tax]] rates on the highest incomes,&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[usury]] laws to discourage risky loans.&lt;ref name="Baram" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner, p. 291"/&gt;

==Criticism of George W. Bush==
The book is significant in Posner's criticism of President [[George W. Bush]] and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 36-37, 113, 139-141, 190, 228-229, 238-239, 248, 271-280, 287, 293, 301, 304-306, 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the shock is due to Posner's longtime "conservative" views.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/01/AR2009050101339.html | accessdate = September 8, 2009 | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul M. | last=Barrett | title=It's Not Your Fault. It's Theirs | date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;  Judge Posner was nominated to the Seventh Circuit by [[Ronald Reagan]], but is "no party man."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

Posner starts his criticism of Bush with a broad attack on his behavior in his final months as President:
{{quote|The lame-duck president seemed uninterested and uninformed about economic matters and was unable to project an image of leadership and instead spent his final months in office in frequent trips abroad and in legacy-polishing while the domestic economy melted away.|Richard Posner&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posner blames Bush for pushing policies, such as the "ownership society",&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; a $10 trillion [[national debt]] and "the huge budget deficits run by the Bush administration",&lt;ref&gt;Posner, P. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; "prop[ping] up stock prices by keeping interest rates low,"&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt; which were underlying causes of the crisis, as well as "Dithering" in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the ''ownership society'', Posner referred to the [[American Dream Down Payment Act of 2003]] and other laws that made ownership easier.

Posner points out that Bush's proposed [[privatization]] of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] would have made the depression even more harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner states that one of the "lessons learned" is that the "blurred" line between "the government and the private sector ... in the Bush Administration" contributed to a lack of insight into the underlying problems.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even more so, "the emphatically pro-business philosophy of the Bush administration made the SEC too trusting of the securities industry."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bottom line is that "there might not have been a depression had it not been for the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of capitalism and mainstream economists==
Posner, famous for his advocacy of free markets, turns on free-market capitalism in this book: "the financial crisis is indeed a crisis of capitalism rather than a failure of government."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 240, bottom line.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner explicitly states that he has changed his mind, that in the words of economist [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], "that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded."&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner states that:
{{Quote|What [[Benjamin Bernanke|Bernanke]] and [[Alan Greenspan|Greenspan]] and the academy can be blamed for is overconfidence in their understanding of how to prevent a depression and, as a result, a failure to attend to warning signs and a lack of preparedness.|Posner&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posner points out that one of the causes of the depression was "blindness to warning signs" of a crisis.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 118-138"/&gt;  A few people had warned of problems, including [[Nouriel Roubini]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 124-125, 132-133, 138-139, 142-143, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brooksley Born]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; but they were ignored.  He asserts that the "depression is a failure of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Posner, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the second and most powerful shock.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;  The ''New York Times'' points out that:
{{quote|It comes as something of a surprise that Posner, a doyen of the market-oriented law-and-economics movement, should deliver a roundhouse punch to the proposition that markets are self-correcting. It might also seem odd that a federal appellate judge (and University of Chicago law lecturer) would be among the first out of the gate with a comprehensive book on the financial crisis — if, that is, the judge were any other judge. But Posner is the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s successor as the country’s most omnivorous and independent-minded public intellectual.|Jonathan Rauch, ''New York Times''&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;}}

==Spreading the blame: Critiques of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, ''et al.''==
Posner also assigns part of the blame for the recession on the administration of [[Bill Clinton]].  He says they were to blame for pushing policies that created the [[housing bubble]].&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 77-78"/&gt;  The training and experience of several Clinton advisors, notably [[Robert Rubin]], were tilted towards [[Wall Street]], which he found to be ultimately dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 81, 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Alan Greenspan]], Clinton's appointee as chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], gets a special blame for pushing low [[interest rate]]s, which increased stock prices and led, in turn, to the bubbles in banking, stocks, and housing.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

Posner sweeps a wide swath in assigning portions of blame for causing the underlying recession on a variety of factors and persons.  He praises the use of specific deterrence in shaming debtors, which, in his mind, has not been used enough recently.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;  He faults the concept of [[limited liability]] for increasing risk.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 85-86, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  He points out the harmful focus on short-term profits at the expenses of long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 80, 94-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad credit was, in Posner's words, given a "so what?" attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 101-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress encouraged home ownership by people who had bad credit and should have, in Posner's view, remained tenants.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 77-78, 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Competition in the banking industry led to deregulation in Clinton's administration, and enactment of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which increased risk to the system.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 45-46, 130"/&gt;  Posner is not alone in criticizing the ''Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act''; some economists, including Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] also believe it helped create the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Baram, "Who's Whining Now? Gramm Slammed By Economists: 'Nation of Whiners' Comments Criticized by Finance Experts in Light of Current Crisis," [[ABC News]], September 19, 2008.  Found at [http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5835269 ABC News website].  Accessed March 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123665023774979341 | accessdate = March 29, 2010 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Damian | last=Paletta | title=Ten Questions for Those Fixing the Financial Mess | date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraging the practice of "sweeps" by large [[investor]]s (removing money from [[demand deposit]]s into [[money market fund]]s overnight) exacerbated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 20, 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preconceptions and [[ideology]] held by both sides of the spectrum, argues the book, prevented novel challenges to changing fiscal realities.&lt;ref name="Posner, pp. 134-136, 310-316"/&gt;  [[Macroeconomics]] has not made use of [[chaos theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 131-134, 261 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and thus says Posner, the ''[[signal-noise ratio]]'' prevented a clear analysis and even created "blindness" and "misinformation" for policy analysts.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 118-138, 141-142, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner went on the record against ''how'' [[Barack Obama]]'s administration's [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] stimulus in the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]] "could have been better designed," and specifically demurs against some of Obama's statements:
{{quote|But the harassment of business over compensation policies, and the impending federal takeover of General Motors, are negatives: they increase the uncertainty of the business environment, which dampens the incentive to invest, and shift the balance between government and business in the management of economic activity too far in favour of the government.|Richard A. Posner &lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;}}

Nonetheless, Posner points out that what is rational for an individual corporation may not be rational for the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, pp. 107, 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jonathan Rauch]] wrote that:
{{quote|By the last page, not a single lazy generalization has survived Posner’s merciless scrutiny, not one populist cliché remains standing. “A Failure of Capitalism” clears away whole forests of cant but leaves readers at a loss as to where to go from here. In other words, it is only a starting point — but an indispensable one.|Jonathan Rauch &lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;}}

The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' gave a long review, noting with a bit of ''[[schadenfreude]]'' that Posner had changed his views.&lt;ref name="Baram"&gt;Marcus Baram, "Judge Richard Posner Questions His Free-Market Faith In "A Failure Of Capitalism"," The ''[[Huffington Post]]'', April 20, 2009, found at [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/20/judge-richard-posner-disc_n_188950.html Huffington Post website].  Accessed September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Casey, in a  review published in the ''[[Irish Times]]'', writes "Blaming the system is a cop-out.... Posner’s approach is far too deterministic", and further calls the book "[a]n incomplete analysis of a floundering social system."&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;Michael Casey, "An incomplete analysis of a floundering social system," August 24, 2009, found at [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2009/0824/1224253135875.html Irish Times website].  Accessed September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Paul M. Barrett]], an assistant managing editor of ''[[Business Week]]'',  writes that Posner seems to spread the blame too much, denigrates mere stupidity and "greed" as causes, and lacks "constructive proposals for reform...."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;  Barrett points out how notable this book is, which is that "his critique is bracing, all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats."&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

The ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' said that "it is at best a partial success; it gets some things right and some things wrong, and the items on both sides of the ledger are important."&lt;ref name="Solow"&gt;Robert M. Solow, "How to Understand the Disaster," ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' Volume 56, Number 8: May 14, 2009, found at [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22655 New York Review of Books website].  Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Review'', Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Robert Solow]] praises the author quite faintly:

{{quote|I have to say that the prose in this book often reads as if it were written, or maybe dictated, in a great hurry. There is some unnecessary repetition, and many paragraphs spend more time than they should on digressions that seem to have occurred to the author in mid-thought. If not exactly chiseled, the prose is nevertheless lively, readable, and plainspoken. The haste may have been justified by the pace of the events he aims to describe and explain. Posner has an extraordinarily sharp mind, and what I take to be a lawyerly skill in argument. But I also have to say that, in some respects, his grasp of economic ideas is precarious.|Robert M. Solow&lt;ref name="Solow" /&gt;}}

Solow's review itself was notable to some degree, according to [[Brad DeLong]], who critiqued Posner's logic along the way:

{{quote|Yet while Posner insists on saving the appearance of individual rationality, he is willing to jettison the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]]'s conclusion that markets are everywhere and always perfect. As Robert Solow observed: "If I had written that, it would not be news. From Richard Posner, it is." Abandoning the conclusion of market perfection opens the door to the idea that government needs to properly check, balance, and regulate markets in order to help them function as well as possible. But clinging to the assumption of individual rationality forces Posner’s view of what regulation is appropriate into a very awkward straightjacket.&lt;ref name="DeLong"&gt;Brad DeLong, "The Chicago School is eclipsed," ''[[The Week]]'', May 29, 2009, found at [http://www.theweek.com/article/index/97134/The_Chicago_School_is_eclipsed]. Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'', Posner was forced to defend his use of the term "[[Depression (economics)|depression]]" and his move "to the centre..."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine printed the preface of the book as a measure of its importance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2009/05/13/posner-preface-capitalism-opinions-business-visionaires-depression.html Forbes.com website].  September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' revisited ''A Failure of Capitalism'', noting that by September 2009, Posner had become a confirmed [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]: "As acts of betrayal go, this was roughly akin to [[Johnny Damon]]'s shaving off his beard, forsaking the [[Red Sox Nation]], and joining the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia.

==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Act on the Institute of National Remembrance &amp;ndash; Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation''' ({{lang-pl|"Ustawy o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej - Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu"}}) is a 1998 Polish law that created the [[Institute of National Remembrance]].  This [[memory laws|memory law]] was amended twice, in 2007 and 2018.

The 1998 Act's Article 55 criminalizes [[historical negationism]] of crimes committed against Poles or Polish citizens by [[Nazi]] or [[Communist]] [[polities]]; of [[crimes against peace]] or [[crimes against humanity|humanity]]; of [[war crimes]]; and of [[political repression]]—all these being listed in Sections 1a and 1b of Article 1.  While [[Holocaust denial]] is not ''explicitly'' mentioned, it is understood to be ''implicity'' criminalized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkI4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162|title=Memory Laws, Memory Wars: The Politics of the Past in Europe and Russia|last=Koposov|first=Nikolay|date=2017-10-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108329538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 amendment dealt with [[lustration in Poland|lustrations conducted in Poland]].

The 2018 amendment made further changes, including the addition of Article 55a, which makes it a crime to "ascribe [[Nazi crimes]] to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State"; and Article 2a, concerning crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by [[Ukrainian nationalists]]. The amendment caused an international controversy.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/01/polands-senate-passes-holocaust-complicity-bill-despite-concerns-from-u-s-israel/|title=Poland’s Senate passes Holocaust complicity bill despite concerns from U.S., Israel|last=Noack|first=Rick|date=2018-02-01|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998 act==
{{main|Institute of National Remembrance}}
The Institute of National Remembrance was established by a Sejm Act of 18 December 1998.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/1/2/|title=Institute of National Remembrance – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation|first=Institute of National|last=Remembrance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 55 ===
The Act's article 55 criminalized "public denial, against the facts, of [[Nazi crimes]], [[communist crimes]], and other offenses constituting [[crimes against peace]], [[crimes against humanity]] or [[war crimes]], committed against persons of Polish nationality or against Polish citizens of other nationalities between 1 September 1939 and 31 July 1990";&lt;ref&gt;[[Poland|Republic of Poland]], ''Dziennik ustaw z 2016 roku, poz. 1575'' (''Register of Statutes'', 2016, item 1575)&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore sometimes restrictively referred to as the "law against [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name= rpan&gt;Rafal Pankowski,

In 1999 an [[Opole University]] history professor, [[Dariusz Ratajczak]], was tried under Article 55 for his [[Holocaust denial]], was found guilty, and was sentenced to a year's probation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Kwiet]], [[Jürgen Matthäus]], ''Contemporary Responses to the Holocaust'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, {{ISBN|0-275-97466-9}}, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://auschwitz.org/en/museum/news/guilty-of-holocaust-denial-negligible-public-harm,227.html|title=News / Museum / Auschwitz-Birkenau|last=www.auschwitz.org|website=auschwitz.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 amendment==
The 2007 amendment dealt with [[lustration in Poland|lustrations conducted in Poland]].

==2018 amendment==
{{undue weight section|date=March 2018}}
{{POV section|date=June 2018}}
The 2018 amendment, intended "to eliminate public misattribution to the Polish Nation or the Polish State of responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the [[German Third Reich]]", was signed into law by [[Andrzej Duda|President Andrzej Duda]] on 6 February 2018. The Amendment will come into force in 3 months after its signing.

Article 55a, referred to by critics variously as the "Polish Holocaust bill", the "Poland Holocaust law", etc., has caused international controversy.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  Critics fear that Article 55a poses an obstacle to free discussion of historical facts about [[the Holocaust in Poland]].

Article 2a, dealing with crimes perpetrated against Poland or Poles by [[Ukrainian nationalists]], caused controversy in [[Ukraine]].

=== History  ===
A 2006 law with some of the same aims, Article 132a of the [[Polish Penal Code]], was passed in 2006, but was invalidated in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After a period of lobbying, the first version of the 2018 Amendment was drafted on 17 February 2016 by [[Ministry of Justice (Poland)|Minister of Justice]] [[Zbigniew Ziobro]]. On 30 August 2016 the [[Council of Ministers (Poland)|Council of Ministers]], presided over by Prime Minister [[Beata Szydło]], forwarded the draft to the [[Sejm]].
&lt;ref name="tr2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislacja.rcl.gov.pl/projekt/12282660|title=Projekt|website=legislacja.rcl.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal rationale given at the submission of the first draft was that diplomatic and public interventions against use of the misleading term "Polish death camp" and the like had proven ineffective. Therefore, it had been decided to create a legal instrument for "counteracting the falsification of Polish history and for protecting the good name of Polish citizens." Thus a new type of crime had been defined, "consisting in the attribution to Polish citizens, in public and against the facts, of the organizing, participation in, or responsibility or co-responsibility for crimes committed by Nazi Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislacja.rcl.gov.pl/docs//2/12282660/12339392/12339393/dokument210290.pdf|title=Draft Amendment, February 17, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was immediately criticized internationally as an attempt to suppress discussion of crimes that had been committed during the Holocaust by Polish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/poland-approves-bill-outlawing-phrase-polish-death-camps |title=Poland approves bill outlawing phrase 'Polish death camps' |agency=Associated Press |date=16 August 2016 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/17/obama-once-referred-to-a-polish-death-camp-in-poland-that-could-soon-be-punishable-by-3-years-in-prison/ |title=Obama once referred to a 'Polish death camp.'

Journalist Jerzy Haszczyński, writing in the Polish newspaper ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'', observed that, when the expression "Polish death camp" appeared in foreign media, it "insidiously suggested that our state and our people were responsible for German crimes"; but he was not sure whom the proposed law would affect.  "Almost every use of the expression that I can recall ended in a profuse apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/print/786/45744/article |title=We didn't build the death camps |first=Jerzy |last=Haszczyński |date=2 September 2016 |work=The Week |accessdate=4 September 2016 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rp.pl/Komentarze/308169898-Haszczynski-Watpliwa-kara-za-polskie-obozy.html |title=Wątpliwa kara za 'polskie obozy' |language=Polish |trans-title=Questionable Punishment for 'Polish Camps' |first=Jerzy |last=Haszczyński |date=16 August 2016 |work=Rzeczpospolita |accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of the "ban of [[propaganda]] of Banderism"  to the law (Article 2a) was spearheaded by the right-wing political movement [[Kukiz'15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/54261/Sejm-uchwalil-ustawe-o-penalizacji-banderyzmu.html|title=Sejm uchwalił ustawę o penalizacji banderyzmu|first=|last=DoRzeczy.pl|date=26 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kukiz'15 submitted this addition on July 16, 2016, however it was blocked by [[Civic Platform]] and [[Law and Justice]] parties citing "the good of Polish-Ukrainian relations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/35189/Kukiz-oskarza-kierownictwo-PiS-o-uleglosc-wobec-spadkobiercow-Bandery.html "Kukiz oskarża kierownictwo PiS o uległość wobec spadkobierców Bandery"], ''[[Do Rzeczy]]'', June 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Article 2a was added to the bill on 25 January 2018 during the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/druk.xsp?nr=993-A Druk nr 993-A, "Additional Report..."], January 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2018, after the bill's third reading, the Polish Parliament's lower chamber, the [[Sejm]], approved the bill,&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018"&gt;{{cite web| last1 =Parliament of Poland| first1 =| last2 =| first2 =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Ustawa z dnia 26 stycznia 2018 r. o zmianie ustawy o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej – Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu, ustawy o grobach i cmentarzach wojennych, ustawy o muzeach oraz ustawy o odpowiedzialności podmiotów zbiorowych za czyny zabronione pod groźbą kary]| work =| publisher =Parliament of Poland| date =2018-01-29| url =http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/771_u/$file/771_u.pdf| format =[[PDF]]| doi =| accessdate =2018-02-02| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6wwITJ7NY?url=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/opinie8.nsf/nazwa/771_u/$file/771_u.pdf| archivedate =2018-02-02| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Art. 1}} which would apply to Poles as well as to foreigners. On 1 February 2018 the upper chamber, the Senate, passed the bill without amendment.  On 6 February 2018 [[Andrzej Duda|President Andrzej Duda]] signed the bill into law.&lt;ref name=noack/&gt;

Some parts of the law will come into effect 14 days after its registration in ''[[Dziennik Ustaw]]'' (the Register of Statutes), with the full law coming into effect within 3 months. The law is also being referred to [[the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] for review of its compliance with the [[Polish Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/07/europe/poland-holcaust-bill-signed-intl/index.html "Polish President signs controversial Holocaust bill into law"], ''CNN'', February 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was interpreted across Israel's political spectrum as promoting the denial of historic facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/world/middleeast/poland-holocaust-law-israel.html?mtrref=www.google.pl&amp;gwh=60D27DE29453356F59B959F3E1193EEF&amp;gwt=pay|title=Israel Slams ‘Baseless’ Holocaust Legislation in Poland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Israelis went so far as to accuse the Polish government of [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name="Selk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/27/it-could-soon-be-a-crime-to-blame-poland-for-nazi-atrocities-and-israel-is-appalled/|title=Analysis {{!}} It could soon be a crime to blame Poland for Nazi atrocities, and Israel is appalled|last=Selk|first=Avi|date=2018-01-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetandap"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5079364,00.html|title=Israeli politicians, survivors blast Polish Holocaust law|publisher=[[Ynet]] and [[Associated Press]]|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2018, the Polish government initiated an online propaganda effort supporting the law, using social media efforts to spread messages supporting the law, and broadcasting advertisements in [[Poland]] as well as [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]. Hashtags such as "#GermanDeathCamps" and "#PolishRighteousness" were spread by government accounts, and a viral video was made that is currently being spread via [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].

In a 24 February 2017 interview, Poland’s Justice Minister and Prosecutor-General [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] indicated that the law would not be enforced until it was cleared by the Constitutional Tribunal.  This was quickly misinterpreted by Israeli media as meaning that the law had been "frozen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Poland-says-controversial-Holocaust-law-isnt-frozen-543583 "POLAND SAYS CONTROVERSIAL HOLOCAUST LAW ISN'T 'FROZEN'"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an opinion poll conducted in February 2018, 51% of Poles opposed the 2018 amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/cbos-40-proc-polakow-jest-za-nowela-ustawy-o-ipn-51-proc-uwaza-ze-dezinformacji-nalezy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill summary===
According to a communiqué of the  [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], an example of such misattribution is the [["Polish death camp" controversy|use of expressions such as "Polish death camps]]". The communiqué further states:&lt;ref name=mfaco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.pl/en/news/communique_of_the_ministry_of_foreign_affairs_on_amendment_of_the_act_on_the_institute_of_national_remembrance_|title=Communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on amendment of the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance|website=www.mfa.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The amended act provides for a penalty, in precisely defined [circumstance]s, for the purpose of preventing intentional defamation of Poland. The final determination of a specific case will rest with the courts. 
 
The provisions of the amended act [shall] not limit freedom of research, discussion of history, or artistic activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed law modifies a previous law relating to the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (namely, the Act of 18 December 1998 on the  – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (Dz.U. 1998 nr 155 poz. 1016)).

The following additions caused most international controversy.

*About responsibility for Nazi crimes, two additions to Article 55:

:Article 55a:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. [Anyone] who, in public and against the facts, ascribes to the Polish Nation or to the Polish State, responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reich, [as] defined in Article 6 of the [[Nuremberg Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal]], Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the [[Axis powers|European Axis]], signed in London on August 8, 1945 [...], or for other offences which are crimes against peace [or] humanity or [that are] war crimes, or who otherwise grossly reduces the responsibility of the actual perpetrators of said crimes, is subject to a fine or [to] imprisonment for up to 3 years. The judgment shall be made public.

2. If a perpetrator of the act referred to in paragraph 1 has acted unintentionally, [such person] shall be subject to a fine or [[community sentence]] [([[:pl:kara ograniczenia wolności|pl]])].

3. No offense referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall have been committed if the act was performed as part of artistic or scholarly activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:and Article 55b:&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Regardless of locally binding regulations at the place at which the forbidden act took place, this law applies to Polish citizens as well as to foreigners in the case that a crime occurs as described by Articles 55 and 55a.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*About crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and Ukraininan Nazi collaborators, 
:the added Article 2a:&lt;ref name="ustawa26stycznia2018" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The crimes of [[Ukrainian nationalists]] and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich, as defined in the Act, are acts committed by Ukrainian nationalists in the years 1925-1950, involving the use of violence, terror or other forms of violation of human rights, against individuals or ethnic groups. One of the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German Reich is their involvement in the extermination of the Jewish population and genocide on citizens of the Second Polish Republic in [[Volhynia]] and Eastern [[Lesser Poland]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:The above text refers to [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]] and to {{ill|ethnic cleansing in Eastern Lesser Poland|pl|Czystka etniczna w Małopolsce Wschodniej}} (''Note'':  Eastern Galicia and {{ill|Eastern Lesser Poland|pl|Małopolska Wschodnia}} overlapped substantially, but were not coterminous: Eastern Galicia was a part of Eastern Lesser Poland annexed by [[Habsburg Austria]] to the [[Austrian Partition]] of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Timothy Snyder]], [http://www.tygodnik.com.pl/numer/275719/snyder.htmlPięć wieków i osiem lat]; ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' – April 2002, an slightly abbreviated text of a conference presentation (Polish original).  English title: "Five Centuries and Eight Years: [[Operation Vistula]] and the homogeneity of Polish society"&lt;/ref&gt;)

The first addition caused international controversy and contributed to a worsening of [[Israel–Poland relations|Israel-Poland relations]].&lt;ref name="Selk" /&gt;

The second addition contributed to worsening of [[Poland-Ukraine relations]].&lt;ref name=spears&gt;[https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/byly-minister-obrony-ukrainy-ostrzega-ponad-milion-ukraincow-moze-chwycic-za-kopie-6217366961669761a "Były minister obrony Ukrainy ostrzega: ponad milion Ukraińców może chwycić za kopie"] "Former Ukrainian Minister of Defense Warns:  over a million Ukrainians may take up the cudgels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over Article 55a ===
{{main|"Polish death camp" controversy#Reactions}}

Article 55a was criticized for being an obstacle to free discussions of historical facts about the [[Holocaust in Poland]]. A letter signed by many prominent persons in early February, including [[Anne Appelbaum]] and the 3rd President of Poland [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], said: "Why should the victims and witnesses of the Holocaust have to watch what they say for fear of being arrested, and will the testimony of a Jewish survivor who “feared Poles” be a punishable offence?".&lt;ref name=aaak&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/05/polish-law-denies-reality-of-holocaust "Polish law denies reality of Holocaust"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before being passed, the law damaged the [[Israel–Poland relations]]. Israel's Foreign Ministry director-general [[Yuval Rotem]] reported that preserving the memory of the Holocaust takes priority over international relations. He said that "Preserving the memory of the Holocaust is a matter beyond the bilateral relationship between Israel and Poland. It is a core issue cutting to the essence of the Jewish people".&lt;ref name="target"/&gt; Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] accused Poland of Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Selk"/&gt; [[Yair Lapid]], a member of the Israeli Parliament, wrote on Twitter:

{{quote|I utterly condemn the new Polish law  which tries to deny Polish complicity in the Holocaust. It was conceived in Germany but hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered without ever meeting a German soldier. There were Polish death camps and no law can ever change that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/yairlapid/status/957208421794709504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/27/it-could-soon-be-a-crime-to-blame-poland-for-nazi-atrocities-and-israel-is-appalled/|title=I utterly condemn the new Polish law  which tries to deny Polish complicity in the Holocaust.

Dr. [[Efraim Zuroff]], head of the Israel office of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], stated that, though he opposes the bill, Lapid's remarks were not factually correct:

{{quote|His words were a gut reaction and they were filled with passion, but unfortunately he does not know the facts and his remarks were absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldisraelnews.com/israeli-holocaust-experts-denounce-polish-law-whitewash-culpability/|title=Holocaust experts denounce Polish law as ‘whitewash’ of culpability|website=WIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/its-complicated-inaccuracies-plague-both-sides-of-polish-death-camps-debate/|title=It’s complicated: Inaccuracies plague both sides of ‘Polish death camps’ debate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Yad Vashem]] condemned the Polish bill, saying that, while "Polish death camps" as a phrase is a historic misrepresentation, the legislation is "liable to blur the historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population during the Holocaust".&lt;ref name="TOI20180127"&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/decrying-new-bill-yad-vashem-says-polish-death-camps-a-misrepresentation/ Yad Vashem: Poland Holocaust law risks ‘serious distortion’ of Polish complicity], Times of Israel, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/27/israel-criticises-poland-over-draft-holocaust-legislation Israel criticises Poland over draft Holocaust legislation], Guardian, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed out that, beyond mere complicity, Poles themselves massacred Jews in the 1941 [[Jedwabne pogrom]] and in the post-war 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]], among other incidents, and that the law would outlaw mention of these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-poland-leave-the-history-writing-to-historians-1.5768084 Analysis Poland Needs to Leave the Holocaust History Writing to Actual Historians], Haaretz, 28 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2018/01/27/news-opinion/world/poland-wants-to-ban-the-term-polish-death-camps-there-are-historical-inaccuracies-on-both-sides-of-the-debate Poland wants to ban the term ‘Polish death camps.’ There are historical inaccuracies on both sides of the debate.], JTA, 27 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI20160818"&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/is-new-polish-law-an-attempt-to-whitewash-its-citizens-roles-in-the-holocaust/ Is new Polish law an attempt to whitewash its citizens’ roles in the Holocaust?], Times of Israel, 18 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; According to Israeli education minister [[Naftali Bennett]], "It is a historic fact that many Poles aided in the murder of Jews, handed them in, abused them, and even killed Jews during and after the Holocaust", and "It is also a historic fact that the Germans initiated, planned, and built the work and death camps in Poland. That is the truth, and no law will rewrite it."  Bennett instructed schools to teach about the Polish role in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-orders-more-holocaust-study-in-schools-including-polish-role-in-wwii/ Bennett orders more Holocaust study in schools, including Polish role in WWII], Times of Israel, 28 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] expressed "disappointment" in the bill, adding: "Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry."&lt;ref name=noack&gt;Rick Noack (6 February 2018): [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/06/polish-president-to-sign-holocaust-bill-despite-international-concerns/ "Polish president signs Holocaust bill, drawing rare U.S. rebuke"], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polish League Against Defamation]] filed a complaint against the Argentine newspaper [[Página/12]], a few hours after the amendment came into force. The complaint is about an article from December 2017, which illustrated the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] with a photo of the ''[[Cursed soldiers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-poland/polish-group-sues-argentine-paper-under-new-holocaust-law-idUSKCN1GF0RF|title= Polish group sues Argentine paper under new Holocaust law|author= |date= March 3, 2018|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the group, the article was "intended to harm the Polish nation and the good reputation of Polish soldiers" and "by issuing such a statement, the publisher showed great historical ignorance for which he should officially apologize to all Poles".&lt;ref name="target"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/International/Argentina-newspaper-first-target-of-controversial-Polish-Holocaust-law-544098|title= ARGENTINA NEWSPAPER FIRST TARGET OF CONTROVERSIAL POLISH HOLOCAUST LAW|author= EYTAN HALON|date= March 3, 2018|publisher= Jerusalem Post|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article had been published before the amendment of the law, and it is unclear how it would be enforced against foreign outlets.&lt;ref name="pagina"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story|title= Poland: group sues Argentinian newspaper under new Holocaust law|author= Christian Davies and Uki Goñi|date= March 5, 2018|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not address whether a retroactive enforcement of law was valid.&lt;ref name="target"/&gt; Página/12 reported that they had not been formally notified, and published interviews with [[Argentine Jew]]s that escaped from Poland during the Holocaust, such as Diana Wang, president of an organization that represents Holocaust survivors and their descendants in Argentina. Other Argentine newspapers showed their support by republishing the article. The secretary for Human Rights [[Claudio Avruj]] said that "No law can limit, condemn or prevent freedom of expression or limit research".&lt;ref name="pagina"/&gt;

[[Jeffrey Kopstein]] of the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Jason Wittenberg]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], authors of the book, ''Intimate Violence: Anti-Jewish Pogroms on the Eve of the Holocaust'', about anti-Jewish violence in Poland such as the [[Szczuczyn pogrom]], opine that the purpose of the new bill "is clear: to restrict discussion of Polish complicity."  They also  suggest that "Poland’s current government will likely face the unpalatable prospect of enforcing an unenforceable law and denying what the mainstream scholarly community has increasingly shown to be true:  Some Poles were complicit in the Holocaust.".&lt;ref name="KopsteinWittenberg" /&gt;

Prof. [[Stanislaw Krajewski]] of the Warsaw University, who co-chairs the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, said that "The way the law is formulated makes it a blunt instrument for paralysing and punishing anyone you don't like", and that "the government's harsh, dismissive reaction to critics has encouraged many people to think they can now attack Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/8727/polish-archbishop-answers-holocaust-law-critics |title=Polish archbishop answers Holocaust law critics |last=Luxmoore |first=Jonathan |date=2018-03-14 |work=The Tablet |access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2018, in front of the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw and Wrocław, 45 Polish citizens made public statements referring to historical events, including the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] and the [[Szczuczyn pogrom]]. The citizens claimed that they attributed responsibility for the events and alleged that their public statements constituted criminal acts under Article 55a of the amended Act of the Institute of National Memory. In the Prosecutors' offices, the citizens deposited formal written documents reporting their alleged crimes.&lt;ref name="OKOPress_selfaccused" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obywatelrp_selfaccused" /&gt;

In late March 2018, an Israeli mayor Eli Dukorsky of [[Kiryat Bialik]], who planned to deliver a speech during an event in Poland had been asked by local Polish municipal authorities to submit his speech in advance prior to its being delivered in the Israeli mayor's Polish [[sister city]], [[Radomsko]]. According to Dukorsky, subsequently Polish authorities were unwilling to accept portions of the speech that referred to Polish complicity in the Holocaust, in particular the estimate that Poles killed 200,000 Jews, and accounts from Holocaust survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Holocaust-memorial-ceremony-canceled-after-Poland-censors-Israeli-speech-545479 HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL CEREMONY CANCELED AFTER POLAND CENSORS ISRAELI SPEECH], ''Jerusalem Post'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://forward.com/fast-forward/396912/israeli-mayor-refuses-to-deliver-remarks-in-poland-censored-under-new/ Israeli Mayor Cancels Speech In Poland After Being Censored Under Holocaust Law], ''[[The Forward]]'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radomsko Mayor Jarosław Ferenc, "some of the content was historically unproven"; among other things, the claims that "Polish farmers killed 200,000 Jews during the war, and that of the six million Jews who were murdered, 200,000 were killed by Poles", were unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/polish-town-cancels-ceremony-with-sister-city-over-holocaust-mention-1.5917860 Polish Town Cancels Ceremony With Israeli Mayor Over Mention of Poles Murdering Jews], ''Haaretz'', 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some media reports have described this event as a ''de facto'' [[censorship]], and a [[chilling effect]] related to the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/world/israeli-mayor-forced-to-cancel-annual-speech-in-poland-over-country-s-new-holocaust-law-1.461002 Israeli mayor forced to cancel annual speech in Poland over country’s new Holocaust law], JC, 20 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lodz.wyborcza.pl/lodz/7,35136,23164282,prezydent-radomska-nie-pozwolil-przemawiac-burmistrzowi-z-izraela.html Prezydent Radomska cenzuruje burmistrza z Izraela.

In April 2018, Polish nationalists called for the investigation of Israeli president [[Reuven Rivlin]] for his remarks at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in which he reportedly told Polish president [[Andrzej Duda]] "that Poland allowed the implementation of Germany's genocide" according to [[National Movement (Poland)|National Movement]] Vice President [[Krzysztof Bosak]]. According to Bosak, "it would be unacceptable if Rivlin asserted that Poland bears any responsibility for the Holocaust", with Bosak saying that his group was testing the enforcement of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/polish-nationalists-call-to-probe-rivlin-over-holocaust-remarks-1.6011170 Polish Nationalists Call to Investigate Israeli President Rivlin Over Holocaust Remarks], Haaretz, 17 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2018 the article was amended, making the offending statements civil, instead of criminal, offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44627129|title=Poland U-turn on Holocaust law|date=2018-06-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime ministers of Poland and Israel issued a joint declaration endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the expression, "Polish concentration camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/27/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-holocaust-law-the-latest.html|title=The Latest: Party Head: Israel Confirms Polish View on Nazis|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over Article 2a ===
{{main|Polish-Ukrainian relations}}
The Amendment's passage worsened Polish-Ukrainian relations, already contentious on the questions of the prewar [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and the wartime and postwar [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].

The '''American Society for Legal History''' is a learned society dedicated to promoting scholarship and teaching in the field of [[legal history]]. It was founded in 1956 and has an international scope, despite being based in [[the United States]]. It sponsors the [[peer-review]]ed journal ''[[Law and History Review]]'' and the book series ''Studies in Legal History'', both of which are published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/membership/aslh |title=American Society for Legal History |website=Cambridge Core |language=en |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the Society established the ''[[American Journal of Legal History]]'', which the Society originally published as its official journal. The journal was later acquired by the [[Temple University Beasley School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv7sAgAAQBAJ |title=Journals of the Century |last=Cole |first=Jim |last2=Stankus |first2=Tony |date=2014-02-25 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317720140|page=236 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.acls.org/ |title=American Society for Legal History |website=American Council of Learned Societies |access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breach of the peace''', or '''disturbing the peace''', is a legal term used in [[constitutional law]] in English-speaking countries, and in a wider [[public order]] sense in the several [[jurisdiction]]s of the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a form of [[disorderly conduct]].

==Public order==
{{expert needed|Crime|section|date=June 2012}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}

Disturbing the peace is a [[crime]] generally defined as the unsettling of proper order in a [[public space]] through one's actions. This can include creating loud noise by fighting or challenging to fight, disturbing others by loud and unreasonable noise (including [[loud music]]), or using [[profanity]].

Disturbing the peace is typically considered a [[misdemeanour]] or an [[infraction]] depending on the [[jurisdiction]] and is often punishable by either a fine or a brief term in jail. On other rare occasions, it is considered an ordinance violation, the lowest level of offence.  In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, a person held in breach of the peace will not have a [[criminal record]] entered against their name,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} which record could otherwise hurt the person's employment prospects (often seriously) and could adversely affect how he or she is viewed and treated by law-enforcement authorities, e.g., what if any bond he or she is granted if arrested in the future.

A violation of a [[Noise regulation|noise ordinance]] is in most jurisdictions not considered a disturbance of the peace unless the perpetrator has disregarded an affirmative request that he or she reduce the noise to a reasonable level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Standards for whether to charge someone with disturbance of the peace are highly subjective, and in many jurisdictions, courts are highly deferential to the opinion of the arresting/charging officer as to whether the accused's actions violated the law (even though in theory the officer's testimony addresses only questions of fact, whereas questions of the law's applicability to those facts are left to the trying court alone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maan|first=Daanish|date=30 June 2010|title=A Look Back at G8 and G20 in Toronto: What Not to Do When Hosting A Global Conference in a Global City|journal=South Asian Generation Next|url=http://www.sagennext.com/2010/06/30/a-look-back-at-g8-and-g20-in-toronto-what-not-to-do-when-hosting-a-global-conference-in-a-global-city/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many local ordinances prohibiting disturbance of the peace exhibit a problematic degree of [[Void for vagueness|vagueness]], occasionally to the point that courts deem them unconstitutional (in United States law) or violative of [[due process]] (in both United States and Commonwealth jurisdictions).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===United States===

In the [[United States]], the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides that members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] shall be [[Parliamentary immunity|immune]] from [[arrest]] in going to and departing from sessions and while Congress is in session except for cases of "[[Treason]], [[Felony]], and Breach of the Peace."  The first two are somewhat self-explanatory; it has been suggested that the third is deliberately somewhat vague.  The [[doctrine]] thus established is called "congressional immunity"; it arose out of the necessity to prevent a vengeful [[Executive (government)|executive]] from arresting members of the [[legislature]] under a pretext to prevent them from taking actions that the executive might find to be displeasing.  In recent years, this doctrine has been used to prevent members from being stopped and held for [[Speed limit|speeding]] on their way to sessions; this apparently is not a "breach of the peace", whereas perhaps another [[misdemeanour]] such as "[[Public intoxication|drunk]] and [[Disorderly conduct|disorderly]]" might be construed as such.  Most states of the United States and most other [[English language|English]]-speaking jurisdictions have extended this privilege to members of their legislatures on the theory outlined above.

''[[Cox v. Louisiana]]'' was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that held that a [[Louisiana]] statute criminalizing breaches of the peace "as authoritatively interpreted by the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] is unconstitutionally broad in scope". The statute read in part:

{{quote|Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby ... crowds or congregates with others ... in or upon ... a public street or public highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building ... and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on ... when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person ... shall be guilty of disturbing the peace.}}

In [[Terminiello v. City of Chicago]], the Supreme Court held that a "breach of peace" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which "stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Justice Douglas stated: "Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
In England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve "a breach of the [[Queen's peace]]", and all indictments formerly concluded "against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity" before the passage of the [[Indictments Act 1915]] and the Rules that formed that Act's first schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1915/90/pdfs/ukpga_19150090_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Indictments Act 1915 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many [[State constitution (United States)|United States state constitution]]s, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the "crown" part or substituting "government". For example, [[New Jersey]]'s is "against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |title=New Jersey State Constitution |publisher=Njleg.state.nj.us |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |archivedate=30 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal [[court]]s assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the [[sheriff]] and of [[Lord of the Manor|lords of manor]] and [[exclusive right|franchise]]s, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from [[tort|civil wrongs]] or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Peace, Breach of the|volume=4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the [[Justices of the Peace Act 1361]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050654/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to riotous and [[barratry (common law)|barratous]] behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as "when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Howell'' [1982] QB 416&lt;/ref&gt;

The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the [[common law]] and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/adult-suspected-at-risk-of-neglect-abuse/law/pcea1984.asp|title=Context of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in gaining access to an adult suspected of being at risk of neglect or abuse: a guide for social workers and their managers in England – SCIE|author=|date=|website=www.scie.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 17(5) of [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE 1984]] abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This "offence" definition and power of arrest are contained under the [[common law]] definition of "breach of the peace". Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws [[Alfred the Great]] consolidated into the [[common law]] approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the [[Justice of the Peace Act 1361]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1|title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting as 'any person' and not fully as sworn officer in this capacity.

The power to arrest for a breach of the peace is usually used to remove violent, potentially violent or provocative offenders (it is not necessary for the offender themselves to be physically involved in any violence) from a scene rapidly.

In England and Wales, breach of the peace is a [[civil proceeding]] (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, '[[Burden of proof (law)|beyond reasonable doubt]]', rather than the civil standard of proof, '[[Burden of proof (law)|on the balance of probabilities]]'. Sometimes the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] conduct the case on behalf of the police, but  the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/binding-over-orders|title=Binding Over Orders {{!}} The Crown Prosecution Service|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breach of the Peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or [[common law]] and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ''ex parte'' Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1948] 1 KB 670, per Lord Goddard, CJ; ''Williamson v. Chief Constable of West Midlands Police'' [2004] (1 WLR 14, per Dyson, LJ)&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, [[constable]]s (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to "prevent a further breach of the peace" which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a Breach of the Peace would occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/other-police-powers-to-restrict-right-to-protest.html|title=Your rights - Other Police Powers to Restrict Right to Protest|publisher=Yourrights.org.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409003229/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/other-police-powers-to-restrict-right-to-protest.html|archivedate=9 April 2010|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to [[bind over]] the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].

===Scotland===
There are major differences between [[English law]] and [[Scottish law]] with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence.

The Scottish law definition of a breach of the peace is "conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community".&lt;ref&gt;Smith v Donnelly 2002 J.C. 65 or 2001 S.L.T. 1007 or 2001 S.C.C.R. 800 (Confirmed with full bench decision in Jones v Carnegie 2004 S.L.T. 609 or 2004 S.C.C.R. 361)&lt;/ref&gt;

A constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring).

Breach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes "rowdiness" or "brawling") and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include [[voyeurism]], persistently following someone, delivering "threatening" letters and "[[streaking]]" or "[[mooning]]".

To prove a breach of the peace, the most important things to prove are that someone was alarmed, annoyed or disturbed by the incident.

This offence can take place anywhere, for example, a public street or any public space.

One of the leading cases in [[Scottish Law]] is that of ''Smith v Donnelly'', a case concerning a Faslane protester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/2001/121.html|title=Smith v Donnelly (Procurator Fiscal, Dumbarton) [2001] ScotHC 121 (28 September 2001)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CCH Canadian Limited''' is one of the four operating units of [[Wolters Kluwer]] Tax &amp; Accounting. CCH Canadian Ltd. is a provider of [[solution]]s in the area of [[tax]], [[accountancy|accounting]], [[law]], [[human resources]] and [[financial plan]]ning.

==History==
CCH Canadian Limited can trace its origins back to 1931 when, as the Kingsland Company, it was responsible for numerous insurance and legal publications.

In 1939 the Kingsland Company became the exclusive distributor in Canada for [[CCH (Commerce Clearing House)|Commerce Clearing House Inc.]]'s loose leaf publication Canadian Tax Reports in three volumes. In 1945 the Kingsland Company and CCH jointly formed CCH Canadian Limited. In 1950, Mr. Kingsland sold his interest in the company and CCH Canadian Limited became a wholly owned affiliate of Commerce Clearing House, Inc.

In 1979, CCH Canadian acquired Formules Municipales Ltée (FM), a Quebec based company which had been supplying forms and stationery requirements of the municipalities and school boards of Quebec since 1886. "FM" was renamed Publications CCH Ltée in 1996 and was becoming one of the largest publishers of legislative information outside the Quebec government, producing French language products and reporting on Quebec provincial laws and regulations which are based on French Civil Law.

CCH Incorporated was purchased by Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publishing company on November 27, 1995.  Wolters Kluwer's core publishing markets include legal, tax and business, health, science, and education, in 26 countries, as well as North America. It has over 19,000 employees worldwide. On January 1, 1996, CCH Incorporated became a wholly owned subsidiary of Wolters Kluwer NV (Amsterdam).

In July, 1998 WK acquired SoftKey, a tax compliance software company. Now located in [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec, the tax compliance products Cantax and TaxPrep (software for preparing tax returns) formed the backbone of CCH's Tax Compliance products. These software products simplify compliance for tax practitioners, preparing tax returns for all federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions.

In September 2000, CCH acquired Portfolio Publishing financial planning software products.

'''Robert Christopher Knight''' is a [[blog]]ger and [[film director|filmmaker]] based in [[North Carolina]] who received much attention for a video he uploaded to [[YouTube]] and a subsequent [[copyright infringement]] clash with [[Viacom]].  The incident has since gone on to be cited in numerous legal writings and court cases involving digital copyright and the interests of corporations versus independent content producers.

==Education==
Knight graduated from [[Rockingham County High School|Rockingham County Senior High School]] in 1992. He earned an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Rockingham Community College]]. In 1999, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Historical Studies from [[Elon University]].&lt;ref name="knightforboard.org"&gt;

==The "Star Wars" school board campaign commercial==
Knight ran for one of five new [[at-large]] seats on the [[Rockingham County, North Carolina]] [[Board of Education]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="co.rockingham.nc.us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.co.rockingham.nc.us/schbdfil.htm | title=Candidate Filings 2006 | publisher= Rockingham County |quote=Age 32 as of 8/3/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-produced a series of [[television advertisement|television commercials]] for his [[political campaign|campaign]].  Knight paid for airtime and the commercials were broadcast on [[WGSR-LD|WGSR Star 39]] from [[Reidsville, North Carolina]] in the month leading up to the November 7 election.

The first commercial that Knight created, dubbed simply "Christopher Knight for School Board Commercial #1",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLi5B0Iefsk YouTube and WGSR Star 39: Christopher Knight for School Board TV Commercial #1, October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; played off the [[Star Wars]] movies. In the one-minute spot, the [[Death Star]] destroys a tiny red [[One-room school|schoolhouse]] while a female [[voice acting|voice actress]] describes how legislation like [[No Child Left Behind]] has turned the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] into a "cosmic bully" that is "targeting and destroying our ability to best teach our children".  The second half of the commercial features Knight wielding a blue-bladed [[lightsaber]], describing how he is a [[Fiscal conservatism|"fiscal conservative"]] who wants more local control over the county's schools.  The commercial ends with Knight twirling the lightsaber in a flourish as he vows "to defend a bright and shining future for the children of Rockingham County".

Knight uploaded the commercial to [[YouTube]], and it soon became noticed by a larger audience. In the weeks before the election, it was featured in many regional [[newspaper]]s, was shown on the [[Fox News Channel]] and was mentioned in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/politics/02local.html "The New York Times: Local Issues Mirror National Ones, but the Special Effects Occasionally Stand Alone, November 6, 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the "Star Wars" school board ad had aroused the attention of [[Edutopia]], the magazine of the [[George Lucas]] Educational Foundation, which declared Knight's commercial to be the "Best Campaign Ad Ever".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/viewings?page=2 "Edutopia: Best Campaign Ad Ever!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713184437/http://www.edutopia.org/viewings?page=2 |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight aired two more commercials before the election, but he failed to win a seat. He came in 8th place out of 16 candidates who ran, which was the largest slate for a single race in Rockingham County history.

Over the next several months, Knight's commercial was screened at the [[American Film Institute]], and was featured on the [[Heritage Foundation]] website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageblogs.org/index.php/958_school-board-jedi "The Heritage Foundation: School Board Jedi, July 9, 2007"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009192326/http://www.heritageblogs.org/index.php/958_school-board-jedi |date=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many other media outlets including ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', ''[[The Soup]]'', on [[MTV]] and numerous international programming.

==The VH1/Viacom/YouTube copyright infringement claim==
The [[television program]] ''[[Web Junk 20]]'' on [[VH1]] aired a special presentation titled "Animals and Other Crap" in July 2007. The show, which highlights funny and unusual video clips found on the Internet, showed Knight's first school board commercial along with commentary by host [[Aries Spears]]. Knight later said that no one from the network had approached him about using his commercial for a for-profit broadcast, or had even told him that it would be aired by the network. However, Knight also said that he thought that the show was so good and Spears' commentary to be so witty, that he didn't mind that VH1 used it at all. As he had done with his original commercial, Knight uploaded the ''Web Junk 20'' segment on YouTube so that he could share it with friends.

On August 29, 2007, YouTube notified Knight him that his video of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip had been taken down at the insistence of VH1's parent company [[Viacom]], claiming Knight's use of the clip was [[copyright infringement]] and violated the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA). Upon being presented with the claim, YouTube had no choice but to pull it per DMCA mandate. Knight objected, as ''Web Junk 20'' had lifted his own material, and claimed that Viacom had violated his copyright first.

Knight contended that per the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], his uploading of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip featuring his own commercial satisfied the four criteria for [[fair use]]. and that VH1's segment was a [[derivative work]] of his own, since the ''Web Junk 20'' clip was based on Knight's original commercial and could not have existed without it. Viacom countered that the ''Web Junk 20'' clip was indeed its own copyrighted material, acknowledging that although it used the commercial that Knight had produced himself, that VH1 had added Aries Spears's image and commentary. Viacom asserted that this was enough to make the entire content of the ''Web Junk 20'' clip, including use of Knight's commercial, their own material protected under copyright.

Following guidelines on YouTube's site, Knight filed a [[DMCA counter-notification|Digital Millennium Copyright Act counter-notification claim]],&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Christopher. [http://theknightshift.blogspot.com/2007/09/youtubeviacom-aftermath-part-2-dmca.html "YOUTUBE/VIACOM AFTERMATH - Part 2: The DMCA Counter-Notification Claim."] ''The Knight Shift.'' September 19, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and per DMCA provisions, Viacom was legally bound to take one of two options: to take Knight to court and file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement, or to let the video be restored on YouTube. After the story gained considerable press coverage, Viacom relented,&lt;ref&gt;Goel, Vindu. [http://www.mercextra.com/blogs/vindu/2007/09/11/followup-chris-knight-wins-battle-with-viacom-over-youtube-clip/ "Followup: Chris Knight wins battle with Viacom over YouTube clip."] ''Vindu's View from the Valley.''  September 11th, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube reinstated Knight's clip of ''Web Junk 20'' featuring his campaign commercial.

The incident has since been referenced in several other stories regarding YouTube and cases of possible copyright infringement, including that of [[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.|the Lenz family's lawsuit against Universal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3777651&amp;page=1 "The Home Video Prince Doesn't Want You to See."] ABC News. October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding a clip they had posted onto YouTube that included several seconds of a song by [[Prince (musician)|musical artist Prince]].

After Viacom relented and dropped its claim, Knight asserted that he had no ill toward Viacom and asked his readers to do likewise. "This ends just as I had hoped it would: with the clip back up and, I like to think, with Viacom and me getting to shake hands and move on and wishing each other well. I'll certainly harbor no hard feelings toward Viacom for the past two weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theknightshift.com/2007/09/viacom-situation-update-youtube-has.html|title=VIACOM SITUATION UPDATE: YouTube has restored my clip|website=www.theknightshift.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Works ==
In late 2010 Knight used his blog to go public about his longtime diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]]. He has since devoted much effort toward sharing his experiences with severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mania]], and the treatment of his disease. As of 2015 Knight is writing a book about his life with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].

Knight and his filmmaking partner Ed Woody are the founders of KWerky Productions. Knight's first film ''Forcery -'' a parody of the [[Misery (film)|film adaptation]] of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' - was heavily featured in the award-winning documentary ''[[The People vs. George Lucas]]''.

Knight is a published op-ed writer who maintains that he is extremely [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] and asks to not be considered as either a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He had stated numerous times that he refuses to vote for or endorse any candidate who produces even a single negative campaign ad against an opponent, without exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theknightshift.com/2012/01/tired-of-negative-political-ads-so-am-i.html|title=Tired of negative political ads?  So am I (and I'm gonna do something about it...)|website=www.theknightshift.com|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is active in [[community theatre]] and enjoys [[Knife making|knifemaking]]. As of 2016 Knight is traveling across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theknightshift.com|title=The Knight Shift|website=theknightshift.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2919">'''Community Legal Advice''' is a government-funded advice service set up by the [[Legal Services Commission]] as part of the Community Legal Service. It aims to help people in [[England]] and [[Wales]] deal with [[Civil law (common law)|civil legal]] problems, and is part of the [[legal aid]] programme in those nations.

It comprises a telephone helpline, advice centres and a series of advice leaflets. Its services also previously included an informational website whose functions were taken over by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] site in February 2011. See: [http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/public/community_legal_advice_helpline.asp www.legalservices.gov.uk/public/community_legal_advice_helpline.asp]

Until November 2008 the service was known as Community Legal Service Direct, and before that as "Just Ask!"

== Telephone helpline ==
The Community Legal Advice telephone helpline gives specific, independent advice to people living on benefits or low income.

Community Legal Advice covers six legal areas:

* Debt
* Welfare benefits and tax credits
* Housing
* Employment
* Education
* Family

== Website ==
The Community Legal Advice website provided self-help information and tools to help people deal with common legal problems themselves. It included advice on areas of law not covered by the telephone helpline such as consumer law, health and social care. By February 2011 (like the online services of the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] in 2007), it was absorbed by the Department of Justice website.  The original CLA site remains readable in "snapshots" in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http://www.communitylegaladvice.org.uk UK government web archive] Retrieved 2011-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Legal Advice Centres ==
The Legal Services Commission also operates walk-in Community Legal Advice Centres. Centres give free, generalized, face-to-face legal advice at an initial appointment and further specialized advice for people eligible for legal aid.

Five Community Legal Advice Centres have been opened in
* Derby
* Gateshead
* Hull
* Leicester
* Portsmouth

Centres are jointly funded by the Legal Services Commission and local councils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalservices.gov.uk/civil/innovations/community_legal_advice_centres_and_networks.asp Legal Services Commission website] Retrieved 2011-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19868">'''Compact theory''' refers to two theories related to the development of [[Federation|federal]] [[constitution]]s. In the United States, it differs from the contract theory in that it favored the rights of states over those of the Federal Government.

==Compact theory in the United States==
Regarding the [[Constitution of the United States]], the compact theory holds that the country was formed through a compact agreed upon by all the states, and that the federal government is thus a creation of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Compact of the Republic: The League of States and the Constitution]] |last=Benner |first=David |authorlink=David Benner |year=2015 |publisher=Life &amp; Liberty Publishing Group |location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, states should be the final arbiters over whether the federal government had overstepped the limits of its authority as set forth in the compact.

===Arguments in favor of the theory===
Leading proponents of this view of the U.S. Constitution primarily originated from Virginia and other southern states.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Notable proponents of the theory include [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomformula.us/classes/live-class-resources/jefferson-giles-12-26-1825/ Jefferson to William B. Giles in letter dated 12/26/1825].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this theory and in reaction to the [[Alien and Sedition Acts|Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798]], Jefferson claimed the federal government overstepped its authority, and advocated nullification of the laws by the states. The first resolution of the [[Kentucky Resolutions]] began by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that the several States composing the [[United States of America]], are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government; but that by compact under the style and title of a [[United States Constitution|Constitution for the United States]] and of [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]] thereto, they constituted a General Government for special purposes, delegated to that Government certain definite powers, reserving each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self Government; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party; that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kentucky Resolutions of 1798|Kentucky Resolutions of 1798]]; see also "Reclaiming the American Revolution," Wm. J. Watkins, Jr.,Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Arguments against the theory===
Others have taken the position that the federal government is not a compact among the states, but instead was formed directly by the people, in their exercise of their sovereign power. The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states, which are not parties to the Constitution, do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority, but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took this position in response to the [[Kentucky Resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;In response to the Kentucky Resolutions' assertion that the states formed the federal government by compact and retained the right to judge the federal government's laws, Vermont said: "This cannot be true. The old confederation, it is true, was formed by the state Legislatures, but the present Constitution of the United States was derived from an higher authority. The people of the United States formed the federal constitution, and not the states, or their Legislatures. And although each state is authorized to propose amendments, yet there is a wide difference between proposing amendments to the constitution, and assuming, or inviting, a power to dictate and control the General Government." {{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Frank Maloy | chapter = [[s:Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions/II|Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] | publisher = American Historical Review | year = 1899 | location = | pages = 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Webster]] advocated this view in his [[Webster-Hayne debate|debate with Robert Hayne]] in the Senate in 1830:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it, declares that it is ordained and established ''by the people of the United States''. So far from saying that it is established by the governments ''of the several States'', it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate. . . . When the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a ''Constitution''; a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it the name of a ''Constitution'', therein they established a distribution of powers between this, their general government, and their several State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Great Speeches and Orations of Daniel Webster/The Reply to Hayne|Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, January 26, 1830]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leading nineteenth century commentary on the Constitution, Justice [[Joseph Story]]'s ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'' (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory, concluding that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not by the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.&lt;ref&gt;Story wrote: "In what light, then, is the constitution of the United States to be regarded? Is it a mere compact, treaty, or confederation of the states composing the Union, or of the people thereof, whereby each of the several states, and the people thereof, have respectively bound themselves to each other? Or is it a form of government, which, having been ratified by a majority of the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them, as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power, to the extent of its provisions? . . . There is nowhere found upon the face of the constitution any clause, intimating it to be a compact, or in anywise providing for its interpretation, as such. On the contrary, the preamble emphatically speaks of it, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government. The language is, 'We, the people of the United States, do ''ordain'' and ''establish'' this ''constitution'' for the United States of America.' ''The people'' do ''ordain'' and ''establish'', not contract and stipulate with each other. The people of the ''United States'', not the distinct people of a ''particular state'' with the people of the other states. The people ordain and establish a '''constitution'',' not a '''confederation''.' . . . Nor should it be omitted, that in the most elaborate expositions of the constitution by its friends, its character, as a permanent form of government, as a fundamental law, as a supreme rule, which no state was at liberty to disregard, suspend, or annul, was constantly admitted, and insisted on, as one of the strongest reasons, why it should be adopted in lieu of the confederation." {{cite book |title=[[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States]] |last=Story |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Story |year=1833 |publisher=Hilliard Gray &amp; Co. |location=Boston |pages=318–319, 326 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1828-1832, [[John C. Calhoun]] argued in his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this "right of judging" as "an essential attribute of sovereignty," which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter bold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights. . . . But the existence of the right of judging of their powers, so clearly established from the sovereignty of States, as clearly implies a veto or control, within its limits, on the action of the General Government, on contested points of authority. . . . May the General Government . . . encroach on the rights reserved to the States respectively? To the States respectively each in its sovereign capacity is reserved the power, by its veto, or right of interposition, to arrest the encroachment." [[s:South Carolina Exposition and Protest|South Carolina Exposition and Protest, 1828]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession. The southern states argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights in their slaves. The southern states stated that they therefore were justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.&lt;ref&gt;For example, South Carolina's statement of secession said: "Thus was established, by compact between the States, a Government with definite objects and powers, limited to the express words of the grant. . . . [T]he constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation. . . . Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection." [[s:Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, 1860]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the Court has stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states.

In one of the Supreme Court's first significant decisions, ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which says that the Constitution was ordained and established by "We the people," and stated: "Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound."&lt;ref&gt;"[The people] made a Confederation of the States the basis of a general government [i.e. the Articles of Confederation]. Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it, and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, established the present Constitution. It is remarkable that, in establishing it, the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and, conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, 'We the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner, and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects in a certain manner." ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). Jay went on to say that the people had delegated to the federal judiciary the task of interpreting the meaning, construction, and operation of the Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states, stating: "The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterizing the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, while stating that the Constitution was established not by the states, but by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.' . . . The Constitution was for a new Government, organized with new substantive powers, and not a mere supplementary charter to a Government already existing. The Confederation was a compact between States, and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the National Government. The Constitution was an act of the people of the United States to supersede the Confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment." ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people, and was not created by the states. The Court stated that the Constitution was binding on the states and could not be negated by the states. The Court again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.&lt;ref&gt;"The government proceeds directly from the people; is 'ordained and established' in the name of the people, and is declared to be ordained, 'in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.' . . . It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the State Governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties. . . . To the formation of a league such as was the Confederation, the State sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, 'in order to form a more perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective Government, possessing great and sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The Government of the Union then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case) is, emphatically and truly, a Government of the people. In form and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit." ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' (1869), a case discussing the legal status of the southern states that had attempted to secede, the Supreme Court stated that the union was not merely a compact among states; rather, the union was "something more than a compact."&lt;ref&gt;"When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States." ''[[Texas v. White]]'', 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compact theory in Canada==

In the [[Canada|Canadian]] context, compact theory posits that [[Confederation of Canada|Confederation]] was an agreement between the two founding peoples, [[French Canadian|French]] and English, and that therefore [[Quebec]] should have special [[veto]] powers relating to its position in the federal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brooks, ''Canadian Democracy: An Introduction'', 5th ed. (Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2007), 201.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, compact theory was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the 1981 [[Patriation Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Compact theory is often advanced by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]].

The '''Criminal Justice Act 1953''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Keadilan Jenayah 1953}}) is a [[Malaysia]]n law which enacted relating to penal servitude, methods of imprisonment and whipping; and for purposes connected therewith.

Section 3 provides that a sentence of [[life imprisonment|imprisonment for life]] is deemed as 30 years imprisonment. Previously, a life sentence was deemed to be 20 years until the Act was amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2007. However, there are some Acts (e.g. [[Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971]]) that provides for the imprisonment for the duration of the natural life of the person sentenced, notwithstanding Section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1953.

==Structure==
The Criminal Justice Act 1953, in its current form (1 June 2013), consists of 6 sections and no schedule (including 3 amendments), without separate Part.
* Section 1: Short title and application
* Section 2: Abolition of penal servitude, rigorous and simple imprisonment
* Section 3: Life sentences
* Section 4: Abolition of whipping with cat-o’-nine tails, etc.
* Section 5: (Omitted)
* Section 6: (Omitted)

The '''crumbling skull rule''' is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] used in some [[tort law]] systems.  It holds that where a plaintiff had a condition or injury that predates the tort and would have naturally deteriorated or worsened over time (e.g. a crumbling skull), the defendant is not responsible to the degree that the condition or injury would have naturally worsened over time.  A defendant is only liable for the degree the injury was worsened or the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by the tort.  The crumbling skull rule should not be confused with the related [[Eggshell skull|thin skull rule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Athey v. Leonati'', [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 34-36, online at: http://canlii.ca/t/1fr63&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is sometimes applied without specific reference to the crumbling skull rule, instead being expressed as a non-absolute application of the thin skull rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Kavanagh v Akhtar Matter No Ca 40492/97'', [1998] NSWSC 779, online at: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth v WL McLean: Developments Inconsistent with the Traditional Nature of the Egg Shell Scull Principle |first=Tanya |last=Jones |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2001/6.pdf |journal=James Cook University Law Review |date= 2001 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

''' ''De facto'' corporation''' and '''corporation by estoppel''' are both terms that are used by [[court]]s in most [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s to describe circumstances in which a business organization that has failed to become a '''[[De jure corporation|''de jure'' corporation]]''' (a corporation by law) will nonetheless be treated as a corporation, thereby shielding [[shareholder]]s from liability.

==''De facto'' corporation==
In order for a ''de facto'' corporation to be created, the following elements must exist:

#There must be an incorporation [[statute]] that lays out the various requirements under which legal incorporation can be accomplished;
#There must have been a good faith attempt to comply with the statute by the intended incorporators;
#:For example, if the [[articles of incorporation]] were mailed to the appropriate office, but addressed to the wrong person, lost in the mail, or not filed by the corporation by the time the corporation began acting in an official capacity.
#There must have been an act made on the corporation's behalf by its purported officers or [[agency (law)|agents]].

If all of these requirements are met, then the business will be treated as a corporation for all purposes, except with respect to acts by the state itself. However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a  person who was ''aware'' that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.

==Corporation by estoppel==
Corporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business ''as if it were'' a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be [[estoppel|estopped]] from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.

==Differences between ''de facto'' corporation and corporation by estoppel==
Both doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort.  The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.

The '''Deputy Attorney General''' ('''DAG''') is the second-highest-ranking official in a department of justice or of law, in various governments of the world.  In those governments, the Deputy Attorney General oversees the day-to-day operation of the department, and may act as [[Attorney General]] during the absence of the Attorney General.

[[Image:University of Edinburgh, Old College.jpg|thumb|right|Old College, home to the [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|Edinburgh School of Law]]]]
The '''Diploma in Legal Practice''' (from its introduction in 1980 until 2012/13) or '''Diploma in Professional Legal Practice''' (from 2012/13) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] postgraduate qualification required in order to practise law in Scotland, as either a [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]] or an [[Advocate#Advocates in Scotland|advocate]]. It is undertaken after completing undergraduate study and before commencing a traineeship.

The course is intended to provide students with the more practical skills they will require after academic study, comprising compulsory modules in conveyancing, civil court practice, criminal court practice, private client, financial services and related skills, accountancy and professional responsibility, with a choice of either company and commercial or public administration.

Until the start of the 2012/13 academic year, the Diploma attracted a quota of funded places from the [[Student Awards Agency for Scotland]] (SAAS), set at three hundred. The funding extended to a contribution of around £3,000 towards fees and a means-tested subsistence allowance. Fees for the Diploma range from £6,630 - £7,700.&lt;ref name="Guidance Note"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Law Society of Scotland|title=GUIDANCE NOTE FOR STUDENTS: THE DIPLOMA IN PROFESSIONAL LEGAL PRACTICE|url=http://www.lawscot.org.uk/media/1019569/Diploma-guidance-note-2017-18.pdf|website=Law Society of Scotland|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012/13, as part of a wider review of funding for postgraduate courses, the [[Scottish Government]] announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/11/24100419|title=Postgraduate funding access widened|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2011-11-24|website=www.scotland.gov.uk|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to the way in which postgraduate courses would be funded, including the Diploma, which became the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice. Since the change students may apply to SAAS for a loan (£3,400 {{As of|2014|lc=on}}) towards the cost of tuition.  There was considerable criticism of the postgraduate funding, in particular that the changes made did not do enough to widen access to the Scottish legal profession.

'''Disposal of human corpses''' is the practice and process of dealing with the remains of a [[death|deceased]] [[human being]].  Like most animals, when humans die, their bodies start to [[decompose]], emitting a foul [[odor]] and attracting [[scavenger]]s and [[decomposer]]s. For these reasons, corpses must be disposed of properly. The problem of body disposal consists of two parts: disposal of the [[soft tissue]]s, which will rapidly decompose, and of the [[skeleton]], which will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions.

Several methods for disposal are practiced.  In many cases, the manner of disposal is dominated by [[spirituality|spiritual]] concerns and a desire to show [[respect]] for the dead, and may be highly [[ritual]]ized.  This event may be part of a larger [[funeral]] ritual.  In other circumstances, such as [[war]] or [[natural disaster]], practical concerns may be forefront.  Many [[religion]]s as well as legal [[jurisdiction]]s have set rules regarding the disposal of corpses.  Since the experience of death is universal to all humans, practices regarding corpse disposal are a part of every [[culture]]. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include [[cremation]] practised by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], and [[Hindus]]; [[burial]] practised by the [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Muslims]]; [[mummification]] practised by the [[Ancient Egyptians]]; and the [[sky burial]] and a similar method of disposal called [[Towers of Silence]] practiced by [[Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Zoroastrians]].

== Legal means of disposal ==

=== Commonly practiced ===

The most common methods of disposal are:{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
* [[Burial]] of the entire body in the [[earth]], often within a [[coffin]] or [[casket]] (also referred to as ''inhumation'')
* Permanent storage in an above-ground [[tomb]] or [[mausoleum]] (also referred to as ''immurement'')
* [[Cremation]], which burns soft tissue and renders much of the skeleton to ash. The remains, known as "cremains" (a portmanteau of "cremated" and "remains") may contain larger pieces of bone which are ground in a machine to the consistency of ash. The ashes are commonly stored in an [[Urn#Cremation urns|urn]], or scattered on land or water.

===Less common===

* Disposal by [[Weathering|exposure]]
** Traditional examples include Tibet [[sky burial]] and the [[Parsi people|Parsi]] [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]]
** A [[body farm]] involves a similar method of disposal as an object of scientific study.
** In some traditions, for example that practiced by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish royal family]], the soft tissues are permitted to rot over a period of decades, after which the bones are entombed.
* [[Burial at sea]]
** Dropping overboard from a ship or plane, a form of burial, often used in a military/naval context, where the corpse, suitably prepared and weighted is deposited into the sea.
** [[Ship burial]], a form of burial at sea in which the corpse is set adrift on a boat.  
* [[Dissolution (chemistry)|Dissolution]], e.g. in [[acid]] or a solution of [[lye]], followed by disposal as [[liquid]]
** Recently there has been much controversy over [[Alkaline hydrolysis (death custom)|alkaline hydrolysis]] (also called Resomation) as a method of body disposal. Advocates claim the process is more environmentally friendly than both cremation and burial, due to CO2 emissions and embalming fluids respectively. On the other hand, many find the idea of being "poured down the drain" to be undignified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24526431/ A rival to burial: Dissolving bodies with lye], MSNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Donation for study – donation to a medical school or similar – after embalming and several years of study and dissection the body is usually eventually cremated.
* [[Cannibalism]], [[ritual]] or otherwise
* [[Space burial]] 
* In cases of [[war]], [[genocide]], or [[natural disasters]] including disease [[epidemics]], large groups of people have been buried in [[mass grave]]s or [[plague pit]]s.
* [[Dismemberment]], in which the body is divided and different body parts are dealt with separately; for example in the case of the [[Habsburgs|Habsburg royal family]] as well as the display of the [[relic]]s of various [[saint]]s.

New methods in development include [[promession]] (freeze-drying), and the mushroom death suit by Infinity Burial Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infinityburialproject.com/|title=Infinity Burial Project|accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of preservation==

In some cases an attempt is made to preserve some or all of a body.  These methods include:
* [[Cryopreservation]]
* [[mummy|Mummification]]; the most well-known examples are from [[ancient Egyptians|ancient Egypt]]
* [[Taxidermy]]: A few people, such as the philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], have had their dead bodies stuffed.
* [[Plastination]]: The preserved (embalmed) body is prepared by [[dissection]] or slicing and fluids are replaced with inert plastic for anatomical study by medical students or display in museums.  This technique was pioneered by [[Gunther von Hagens]] of the [[Institute for Plastination]].

Human remains of [[archeology|archaeological]] or [[medicine|medical]] interest are often kept in [[museum]]s and private collections.  This practice is controversial (See [[NAGPRA]]).  In the cases of [[Native Americans in the United States]], possession of remains and related objects is regulated by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA Act of 1990]].

==Preparation for disposal==

Different [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s have various [[funeral|funeral rites]] that accompany the disposal of a body. Some require that all parts of the body are buried together. If an [[autopsy]] has occurred, removed parts of the body are sewn back into the body so that they may be buried with the rest of the corpse.

When it is not possible for a body to be disposed of promptly, it is generally stored at a [[morgue]]. Where this is not possible, such as on a battlefield, [[body bag]]s are used.  In the [[Western world]], [[embalming]] of the body is a standard part of preparation.  This is intended to temporarily preserve the corpse throughout the [[funeral]] process.

==Legal regulation==

Many [[jurisdiction]]s have enacted [[regulation]]s relating to the disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime. In some places, it is also a crime to fail to report a death, and to fail to report the disposal of the body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Body parts==

Certain conditions such as [[necrosis]] can cause parts of the body such as limbs or internal organs to die without causing the death of the individual.  In such cases the body parts are usually not given a funeral.  Surgical removal of dead tissue is usually necessary to prevent [[gangrene|gangrenous]] [[infection]]. Surgically removed body parts are typically disposed of as [[medical waste]], unless they need to be preserved for cultural reasons, as described above.

Conversely, [[organ donation|donated organs]] or tissue may live on long after the death of an individual.

==Criminal disposal==

In some cases, a body is disposed of in such a way as to prevent, hinder, or delay discovery of the body, to prevent [[Body identification|identification]] of the body, or to prevent [[autopsy]].  In such cases, the deceased is considered a [[missing person]] as long as a body is not identified, unless death is so likely that the person is declared [[legal death|legally dead]].
	 
This often occurs as part of a [[murder]] or [[voluntary manslaughter]].  In other cases, an individual who did not intend to cause death may still feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about a death (e.g. by [[involuntary manslaughter]] or an [[accident]]) and may attempt to prevent discovery of the body.  This can exacerbate any legal consequences associated with the death.
	 
Other [[Base motive|motives]] for concealing death or the cause of death include [[insurance fraud]] or the desire to collect the [[pension]] of the deceased.  An individual may commit [[suicide]] in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a [[life insurance]] policy to collect on the policy.

Criminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposingOfABody|title=Disposing of a Body - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Illegal use of conventional methods, commonly burial in a place unlikely to draw attention, or water disposal (e.g. [[Cleveland Torso Murderer]])
* Dissolution was used by [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], smashing or dissolving the skeleton
* Cannibalism (e.g. [[Jeffrey Dahmer]])
* Grinding into small pieces for disposal in nature, disposal via a sewer system, or use as fertilizer
* Boiling (used by [[Futoshi Matsunaga]] and [[Dennis Nilsen]])
* Encasing in [[concrete]] (e.g. [[murder of Junko Furuta]])
* Hiding in trash or landfill (e.g. [[murder of David Stack]], [[disappearance of Natalee Holloway]])
* Feeding to animals (e.g. pigs or flesh-eating insects; used by [[Ted Bundy]])
* Abandonment in an area where the body can degrade significantly before being discovered, if ever, such as a remote area (e.g. [[West Mesa murders]]), cave, abandoned well, abandoned mine, or a neglected or hazardous third-party property (known as a dump job); sometimes dropped in an easily discovered but out-of-the-way location to obscure the identity of the murderer (e.g. [[Fountain Avenue]], Brooklyn)
* Dropping into a destructive or impassible natural hazard, such as a volcano, quicksand, or crevasse
* Destruction by industrial process, such as machinery, chemical bath, molten metal, or a [[wrecking yard|junked]] [[automobile|car]]
* Injection into the legitimate body disposal system (e.g. morgue, funeral home, cemetery, crematorium, funeral pyre, cadaver donation) or killings at a health care facility (e.g. [[Ann Arbor Hospital Murders]] and [[Dr. X killings]])
* Burning, often in a building (e.g. possibly the [[Clinton Avenue Five]])
* Disguising as animal flesh (e.g. abattoir, food waste, food; as [[Katherine Knight]] did)
* Attachment to a vehicle travelling to a distant place
* Creating false evidence of the circumstances of death and letting investigators dispose of the body, possibly obscuring identity
* Indefinite storage (e.g. in a freezer or refrigerator, as in the murder of [[Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.]])

===Illegal disposal of bodies in water===

Disposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a [[burial at sea]] and a [[burial]] on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law.

====Disposal of evidence====
There may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The [[American Mafia|Mafia]] is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The ''Chicago-style'' method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In [[Venice]], barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing.

In other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures.

====Problems====
While a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney [[Coogee, New South Wales#Coogee Palace Aquarium .281887-1986.29|Coogee Aquarium]] that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a [[The Shark Arm Case|murder investigation]]. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted.

Many criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.

Very cold water with little oxygen may even preserve bodies, allowing for an easier identification, as for example [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'' in [[Wast Water]] lake in the [[Wasdale]] area (see [[National Trust Properties in England]]). She was found after 8 years, with her body preserved like wax.

====Cases====
* [[Gary Ridgway]] (born 1949), the Green River Killer, disposed most of his bodies in or near the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]]
* In [[the Shark Arm Case]], James Smith's murder was discovered when a shark in the [[Sydney]] Coogee Aquarium vomited up his severed arm in 1935
* [[Thomas Capano|Anne Marie Fahey]], scheduling secretary for then [[Governor of Delaware|Delaware Governor]] [[Thomas Carper]], was killed by prominent Delaware attorney Thomas Capano and was dumped, inside of a large "Igloo" cooler, into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the [[New Jersey]] coast with the help of his brother, Jerry; however, the body was then removed and weighted down with an anchor to make it sink into deeper water. Only the cooler was recovered and was buried by the Fahey family after the Capano case.
* [[Emmett Till]], his body dumped in the [[Tallahatchie River]] in [[Mississippi]] in 1955
* [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'', murdered 1976, and found 1984
* [[Laci Peterson]], the wife of [[Scott Peterson]], murdered 2002 and found on the shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]].
* [[Shinjiro Matsumoto]], Japanese businessman, his wife Chika and two children, murdered by Chinese students in 2002 and dumped into [[Hakata Bay]] in [[Fukuoka]].
* Quang Lu, a [[Thornhill, Ontario]] [[loan shark]] was found entombed in a rusty steel barrel full of concrete in [[Lake Ontario]] after police received an anonymous tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Murdered Asian loan shark in barrel |author=Rob Lamberti |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html |dead-url=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529024524/http://www.torontosun.com:80/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html | archive-date=May 29, 2010 | |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Serial killers [[John  Wayne Gacy]] and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] disposed their victims' bodies in the [[Des Plaines River]].
* The 1990s film, [[Amistad (film)|Amistad]], depicts a group of slaves being chained and then thrown alive into the sea to die by drowning. This method was applied by crews of slave-trade ships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2614">An '''examination support document''' ('''ESD''') was a submission formerly proposed to be required to be made to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] by an applicant for a United States [[patent]] under certain circumstances.  An ESD would be required to comprise at least:
*A statement that a [[prior art]] search was done including the fields of search and search logic;
*A listing of the references deemed most closely related to the [[Claim (patent)|claim]]s pending in the [[patent application]];
*An identification in each reference of all of the limitations in each claim found in said reference.
*A detailed explanation pointing out how each independent claim is allowable over the prior art; and
*A showing of where each limitation in each claim is found in the specification the patent application.

As of November 1, 2007, examination support documents were to be required for each patent application that had more than 5 independent claims or more than 25 dependent claims that had not had a first [[office action]] on the merits of its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/72fr46716.pdf “''37 CFR Part 1 Changes To Practice for Continued Examination Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably Indistinct Claims, and Examination of Claims in Patent Applications; Final Rule''”], Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 161 / Tuesday, August 21, 2007 / Rules and Regulations, pp 46716 – 46843 &lt;/ref&gt;

Examination support documents were controversial. Many [[patent attorney|US patent agents or attorneys]] felt that they would force an inventor to, in essence, examine his or her own application.  Others felt that they would help speed up patent examination and improve patent quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2007/09/uspto-guideline.html#comments “USPTO Guidelines for Examination Support Documents (ESD)” Patently O blog and comments.  Original posting September 13, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirement never came into effect because of a preliminary injunction&lt;ref name="deferred"&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41261.pdf "Deferred Examination of Patent Applications: Implications for Innovation Policy," Congressional Research Service]&lt;/ref&gt; and was abolished effective October 14, 2009.&lt;ref name="deferred" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-10-14/pdf/E9-24667.pdf 74 FR 52686, Changes to Practice for Continued Examination Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably Indistinct Claims, and Examination of Claims in Patent Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24300">[[File:Jamal al-Din Husayn Inju Shirazi - Two Folios from the Akbarnama - Walters W684 - Detail A.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''[[Akbarnama]]'', the official chronicle of the reign of [[Akbar]], the third [[Mughal emperor]]]]

'''Execution by elephant''' was a common method of [[capital punishment]] in [[south Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[India]], where [[Asian elephant]]s were used to [[Crushing (execution)|crush]], dismember or torture captives in [[public execution]]s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's [[absolute monarchy|absolute power]] and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the [[European colonialism|European empires]] that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by [[Western world|Western]] powers, such as [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Carthage]], particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

== Cultural aspects ==
The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than [[horse]]s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of [[war elephant]]s with generals such as [[Hannibal]]. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or ''[[mahout]]'', thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities.&lt;ref name="allsen"&gt;Allsen, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Several such exercises of [[pardon|mercy]] are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of [[Siam]] trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]] is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him.&lt;ref name="Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were occasionally used in [[trial by ordeal]] in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as [[Thailand]], where [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephants]] are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

== Geographical scope ==
[[File:Execution by elephant distribution map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Geographical scope of executions by elephant]]
Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While [[African elephant]]s are significantly larger than [[Asian elephant]]s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

==== Southeast Asia ====
Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] from the earliest historical times&lt;ref&gt;Chevers, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the kingdom of [[Champa]] on the other side of the [[Indochina|Indochinese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. "The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics". University of California Press, 1985. p. 80. ASIN: B0000CLTET&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siam]], elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] provides the following account from Siam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YCoCwtJd1gC&amp;pg=181|title=A new account of the East Indies|publisher=John Mosman|volume=2|year=1727|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Treason and Murder, the Elephant is the Executioner. The condemned Person is made fast to a Stake driven into the Ground for the Purpose, and the Elephant is brought to view him, and goes twice or thrice round him, and when the Elephant's Keeper speaks to the monstrous Executioner, he twines his Trunk round the Person and Stake, and pulling the Stake from the Ground with great Violence, tosses the Man and the Stake into the Air, and in coming down, receives him on his Teeth, and making him off again, puts one of his fore Feet on the Carcase, and squeezes it flat.}}

The journal of [[John Crawfurd]] records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of [[Cochinchina]] (modern south [[Vietnam]]), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."&lt;ref&gt;Crawfurd, John. "Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-general of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin China". H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1830. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y53maIltQQwC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=%22On%20these%20occasions%20the%20criminal%20is%20tied%20to%20a%20stake,%20and%20the%20elephant+runs+down+upon+him%20and%20crushes%20him%20to%20death%22&amp;ei=TUotStT_DaHSkATLqPT2Bg p. 419].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Asia ====

===== India =====
Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; The Hindu ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1305, the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultan of Delhi]] turned the deaths of [[Mongol]] prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford-Genghis Khan, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Natesan, G.A. ''The Indian Review'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]], writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler [[Shah Jahan]] ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] ordered the crushing by elephant of an [[imam]] he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor [[Jahangir]], is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The [[France|French]] traveler [[François Bernier]], who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment.&lt;ref name="Schimmel" /&gt; Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of [[Delhi]], elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;
The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting [[Delhi]] in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.}}
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The [[Maratha]] [[Chatrapati]]  [[Sambhaji]] ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Maratha leader, the general [[Santaji]], inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Toru Du MOnde.jpg|thumbnail|[[Louis Rousselet]] described this execution in ''Le Tour du Monde'' in 1868.]]
The early 19th century writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] relates how the king of [[Goa]] "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc. "Natural history of man, the globe, and of quadrupeds". vol. 1. Leavitt &amp; Allen, 1857. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at [[Baroda]] in 1814 has been preserved in ''The Percy Anecdotes'':

{{quote|The man was a slave, and two days before had murdered his master, brother to a native chieftain, called Ameer Sahib. About eleven o'clock the elephant was brought out, with only the driver on his back, surrounded by natives with bamboos in their hands. The criminal was placed three yards behind on the ground, his legs tied by three ropes, which were fastened to a ring on the right hind leg of the animal. At every step the elephant took, it jerked him forward, and every eight or ten steps must have dislocated another limb, for they were loose and broken when the elephant had proceeded five hundred yards. The man, though covered in mud, showed every sign of life, and seemed to be in the most excruciating torments. After having been tortured in this manner for about an hour, he was taken to the outside of the town, when the elephant, which is instructed for such purposes, was backed, and put his foot on the head of the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryley Scott, George. "The Percy Anecdotes vol. VIII". ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages''. Torchstream Books, 1940. pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, [[Louis Rousselet]] described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a [[woodcut]] and printed in "[[Le Tour du Monde]]", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Weekly'', February 3, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of the [[British Empire]] led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in [[Kashmir]], since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, Eleanor. "What the Crystal Revealed". ''American Theosophist Magazine'', April to September 1914. p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sri Lanka =====
[[File:Crushed by elephant.png|thumb|right|A condemned prisoner being dismembered by an elephant in [[Ceylon]]. Illustration from ''[[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]]'' by Robert Knox (1681).]]
Elephants were widely used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in [[Sri Lanka]]. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their [[tusk]]s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14346 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]". London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century traveler [[James Emerson Tennent]] comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk."&lt;ref&gt;Tennent, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, ''An Execution by an Eliphant''.

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat [[Henry Charles Sirr]] described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last king of [[Kandy]], to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:&lt;ref&gt;Sirr, Sir Charles Henry, quoted in Barrow, George. "Ceylon: Past and Present". John Murray, 1857. pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the native dynasty it was the practice to train elephants to put criminals to death by trampling upon them, the creatures being taught to prolong the agony of the wretched sufferers by crushing the limbs, avoiding the vital parts. With the last tyrant king of Candy, this was a favourite mode of execution and as one of the elephant executioners was at the former capital during our sojourn there we were particularly anxious to test the creature's sagacity and memory. The animal was mottled and of enormous size, and was quietly standing there with his keeper seated upon his neck; the noble who accompanied us desired the man to dismount and stand on one side.

The chief then gave the word of command, ordering the creature to 'slay the wretch!' The elephant raised his trunk, and twined it, as if around a human being; the creature then made motions as if he were depositing the man on the earth before him, then slowly raised his back-foot, placing it alternately upon the spots where the limbs of the sufferer would have been. This he continued to do for some minutes; then, as if satisfied that the bones must be crushed, the elephant raised his trunk high upon his head and stood motionless; the chief then ordered him to 'complete his work,' and the creature immediately placed one foot, as if upon the man's abdomen, and the other upon his head, apparently using his entire strength to crush and terminate the wretch's misery.}}

==== West Asia ====
During the [[medieval]] period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] empires.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; When the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]], who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab [[Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir|Na'aman]], Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a [[Zoroastrian]]; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. [[Rabbi]] [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]], a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]-ruled northern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]):&lt;ref&gt;Benisch, A. (trans). "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon". London, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Execution of Prisonsers Belgrade-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature depicting the execution of prisoners of war in [[Belgrade|Nándorfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matrakci |last=Nasuh |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Suleymanname/Execution_of_Prisonsers_Belgrade-Suleymanname.htm |title=Execution of Prisoners, Belgrade |date=1588 |work=Süleymanname, Topkapi Sarai Museum, Ms Hazine 1517}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote|At [[Nineveh]] there was an elephant. Its head is not protruding. It is big, eats about two wagon loads of straw at once; its mouth is in its breast, and when it wants to eat it protrudes its lip about two [[cubit]]s, takes up the straw with it, and puts it in its mouth. When the sultan condemns anyone to death, they say to the elephant, "this person is guilty." It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.}}

=== Western empires ===
The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[ancient Macedonians]] occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of [[war elephant]]s for military purposes, most famously in the case of [[Hannibal]]. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. [[Perdiccas]], who became regent of [[Macedon]] on the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robin Lane. "Alexander the Great". Penguin, 2004. p. 474. {{ISBN|0-14-008878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm Curt. 10.6-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103055130/http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm |date=2006-01-03 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] records how the general [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]] "after King [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Alison (Quoted by) (ed.). "A Sourcebook on the Roman Games". Blackwell Publishing, 2006. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by [[Josephus]] and the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of [[3 Maccabees]] in connection with the [[Egyptian Jews]], though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}
'''"Only one eye for one eye"'''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1945 | pp = 571ff}}, also known as '''"An eye for an eye"''' or '''"A tooth for a tooth"''', or the '''law of retaliation''', is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} The intent behind the principle was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}

The principle is sometimes referred using the Latin term '''''lex talionis''''' or '''the law of talion'''. The English word talion (from the [[Latin]]'' [[wikt:talio#Noun 3|talio]]''{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}) means a retaliation authorized by law, in which the punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.

==Definition and methods==
The term '''''lex talionis''''' does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather [[mirror punishment]]) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Douglas A | last1 = Knight | first2 = Amy-Jill | last2 = Levine | year = 2011 | title = The Meaning of the Bible| publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-06-112175-3 |page = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common expression of lex talionis is "an eye for an eye", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of ''lex talionis'' have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a [[felony]]. In the famous legal [[Code of Hammurabi|code]] written by [[Hammurabi]], the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC | loc = §230}}

The simplest example is the "eye for an eye" principle.  In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the twelve tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of [[wergild]] for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern [[tort]] law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well.  The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is "The law of retaliation." The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.

==Antecedents==
Various ideas regarding the origins of ''lex talionis'' exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, [[feud]]s and [[Feud|vendettas]], threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, ''lex talionis'' systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.

The principle is found in [[Babylonian Law]].{{Sfn | Hammurabi | 1780 BC}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bond |first=Kenneth |year=1998 |quote=...Code of Hammurabi (1780 BC).  I used a translation by LW King with Commentary by Charles F. Horne (1915). My version was a 1996 electronically enhanced version of the 1910 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. |url=http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |title=Religious Beliefs as a Basis for Ethical Decision Making in the Workplace |publisher=[[Humboldt State University]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703102021/http://www.humboldt.edu/~kmb2/paper.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take [[revenge|vengeful]] retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society.  As with [[blasphemy]] or [[lèse-majesté]] (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.

[[Roman law]] moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance.  In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although ''talio'' was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507759/Roman-law/41328/Delict-and-contract#ref469137 | contribution = Roman law: Delict and contract | title = Encyclopædia Britannica}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
The principle was first referenced in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which predates the Hebrew bible.  In the Hebrew Law, the "eye for eye" was to ''restrict'' compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}}  The idiomatic biblical phrase "an eye for an eye" in Exodus and Leviticus ({{Hebrew|עין תחת עין}}, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally  "eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses.&lt;ref name=lev24&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ex21&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:22–25|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = deut19&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16-21|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in [[Leviticus]] states, "And a man who injures his countryman{{snd}}as he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him." (Lev. 24:19–21)&lt;ref name="lev24" /&gt;. For an example of {{Hebrew|תחת}} being used in its regular sense of ''under'', see Lev. 22:27 "A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day..."

===Judaism===
Isaac Kalimi explains that the "lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted "an eye for an eye" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the ''[[peshat]]'' (literal meaning) of the written Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biblical interpretation in Judaism and Christianity |first1= Isaac |last1= Kalimi | first2= Peter J | last2 = Haas | author2-link = Peter Haas (rabbi) | publisher = Continuum | year = 2006 | page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h6bSc6ksh0YC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=daYBTeziHZKesQPx-_HjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to "adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A concise history of the Jewish people | first1 = Naomi E | last1 = Pasachoff | first2 = Robert J | last2 = Littman | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2005 | page = 64 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z4eaj09hscAC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Judaism+%22lex+talionis%22&amp;ei=pKoBTe_WDJO8sQPN1aD7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22lex%20talionis%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talmud====
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]] | at = 83b–84a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.
{{Quote | The Oral Law explains, based upon the biblical verses, that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation, consisting of payment for "Damages, Pain, Medical Expenses, Incapacitation, and Mental Anguish" — which underlies many modern legal codes. Some rabbinic literature explains, moreover, that the expression, "An eye for an eye, etc." suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye, but that biblical law treats him leniently. − Paraphrased from the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]].&lt;ref name = "OU"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/torah.htm | contribution = Torah | publisher = ou.org | title = About Judaism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase ''ayin tachat ayin'' makes another appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:16–21|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to "do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother".&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Nezikin|Makot]] | at = 1:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bab. Talmud | at = 2a}}, based on critical [[exegesis]] of {{bibleverse ||Dt|25:1–3|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot.  There is one case where the Torah states "…and you shall cut off her hand…"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|25:11–12|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner.  This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sifrei]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Maimonides]] | title = Yad}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Nezikin | last = Hillel | contribution = Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh | at = 1:7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.

{{bibleverse ||Numbers|35:9–30|JP}} discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of "redeemer of blood". In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the "redeemer of blood" may not kill him.  If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the "redeemer of blood", as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party. Nevertheless, the provision of the "redeemer of blood" does not serve as true reciprocal justice, because the redeemer only acts to penalize a negligent killer who forgoes his exile. Furthermore, intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus cannot serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter, but as a penalty for escaping punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Makot | at = 7a–13a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud.  The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.

====Objective of reciprocal justice in Judaism====
The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (''middah k'neged middah'') in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst"&lt;ref name="bibleverse ||Dt|19:19|JP"/&gt;) and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Dt|19:20|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Lv|19:17–18|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hierarchy and reciprocal justice====
In Exodus 21, as in the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Ex|21:23–25|JP}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.&lt;ref name = "Coogan"&gt;{{cite book| last = Coogan | first = Michael D | authorlink = Michael Coogan | title = A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| location = New York| year = 2009| page = 112 | isbn = 978-0-19-533272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the "eye for eye" principle is directly followed by the proclamation "You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse ||Lv|24:19–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan,{{who|date=February 2015}} "to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them."&lt;ref name = "Coogan" /&gt;

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], [[Jesus]] urges his followers to [[turn the other cheek]]:

Some interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury.{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | p = 572}} Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Righteous Personal Conduct Interpretation of Turning the Other Cheek|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Righteous_personal_conduct_interpretation|website=Wikepedia|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

[[Christian]] interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the [[Church father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]]. He already discussed in his ''[[Contra Faustum]]'', Book XIX, the points of 'fulfilment or destruction' of the Jewish law.&lt;ref name = "New Advent"&gt;{{Citation | title = Fathers | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/140619.htm | contribution = Contra Faustum | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | publisher = NewAdvent}}.&lt;/ref&gt; George Robinson characterizes the passage of Exodus ("an eye for an eye") as one of the "most controversial in the Bible". According to Robinson, some have pointed to this passage as evidence of the vengeful nature of justice in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Essential Judaism: a complete guide to beliefs, customs and rituals|first = George|last = Robinson|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year = 2000|page = 242|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=huTgZdgnXs4C&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=george+robinson+most+controversial+bible+eye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r728JIroEM&amp;sig=XfrFaFpgX4oYkLwQet7sX4P5tLI&amp;ei=lIAkTZCrG4eycNeZ8K8B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 978-0-671-03481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Abraham Bloch speculates that the "lex talionis has been singled out as a classical example of biblical harshness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A book of Jewish ethical concepts: Biblical and postbiblical |first=Abraham P |last=Bloch |publisher=KTAV |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harry S.

===Islam===
{{Main|Qisas}}
The [[Qur'an]] mentions the "eye for an eye" concept as being ordained for the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = V: 45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in [[Al-Baqara|{{Citation | title = Qur'an | at = 2:178}}]]: "O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (''Qisas'') for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.  But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment." Muslim countries that use Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, such as [[Iran]] or Saudi Arabia, apply the "eye for an eye" rule literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7754756.stm | title = Court orders Iranian man blinded | publisher = BBC | date = 28 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/14/acid-blinding-postponed-iran-outcry | title = Acid blinding sentence postponed by Iran after international outcry | newspaper = The Guardian | place = UK | date = 14 May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | In the Torah We prescribed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, an equal wound for a wound: if anyone forgoes this out of charity, it will serve as atonement for his bad deeds. Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are doing grave wrong. ([[Al-Ma'ida|{{Citation | title = Qurʾān | at = 5:45}}]])}}

{{Linguistics}}
'''Forensic linguistics''', '''legal linguistics''', or '''language and the law''', is the application of [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge, methods and insights to the [[forensic]] context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. It is a branch of [[applied linguistics]].

There are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts:&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;{{Cite web |title=Centre for Forensic Linguistics |publisher=Aston University |url=http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927010829/http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |archivedate=27 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* understanding language of the written law,
* understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and
* the provision of linguistic evidence.

The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogenous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.

==History==

The phrase ''forensic linguistics'' first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of [[linguistics]], used it in an analysis of statements by [[Timothy John Evans]].&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"&gt;John Olsson (2008), ''Forensic Linguistics, Second Edition''. London: Continuum {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at [[Notting Hill]] police station in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olsson, John. “What Is Forensic Linguistics?” ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out.

Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84031094/1927-09-09/ed-1/seq-2/# "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note"]&lt;/ref&gt; in "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note" "Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling."  Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their [[Miranda rights]] during the interrogation process.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, John. "What Is Forensic Linguistics?" ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant [[McDonald's]] claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as [[McWords]]) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Ayres, Jr | first = B. Drummond | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/us/mcdonald-s-to-court-mc-is-ours.html | title = McDonald's, to Court: 'Mc' Is Ours | date=22 July 1988 | accessdate = 19 March 2012 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They discovered that a phrase such as {{'}}''the same language''{{'}} is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.

The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics. 2017. "Gründung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Rechtslinguistik. Abendgymnasium Wien. http://wien.abendgymnasium.at/gruendung-der-oesterreichischen-gesellschaft-fuer-rechtslinguistik/&lt;/ref&gt; it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alison Johnson, Malcolm Coulthard. 2010.

==Areas of study==
The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:

===The language of legal texts===
The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} is that of the transformative effect of [[Norman French]] and [[Latin|Ecclesiastic Latin]] on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it.  It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making [[legal writing|legal language]] more comprehensible to laypeople.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that 
* "It is indeed hard to deny that the rule of law is in fact the rule of language. It seems that there cannot be law without language. Kelsen (1945: 161) wrote that '[j]ust as everything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which the law refers becomes law, i.e. something legally e x i s t i n g'. The concept of law is conveyed and mediated entirely through the structures of human language and it is thus plausible to assume that everything the law touches is therefore also touched by language. This is particularly evident in the fact that all processes of legal meaning-making and meaning-seeking are inextricably tied to the language system. ... [L]aw is defined as a set of linguistic signs which is ascribed the societal power to control human conduct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Leisser]] (2017) ''„Adjectival Vagueness in Legal Language: The Case of the Austrian Civil Code“'' Vienna: University of Vienna, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The language of legal processes===
Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews.

Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase "requests" as "commands", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. &amp; Tiersma, P, 2005).

A defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the ''Louisiana vs. Demesme'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasc.org/news_releases/2017/2017-052.asp|title=2017-052.asp|website=www.lasc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

==Forensic text types==

===Emergency call===
In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Intonational emphasis, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analysing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.

Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Ransom demands or other threat communication===
Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: "We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care" (''sic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/crime.html|title=The Kidnapping|work=PBS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ransom Notes: An Analysis of Their Content &amp; "Signature"|author=Falzini, Mark W.|work=Archival Ramblings|url=http://njspmuseum.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-of-most-fascinating-areas-of-study.html|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as "your child is being held in a private location" being written ahead of time.

===Suicide letters===
A suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004" /&gt; The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004"&gt;John Olsson (2004). ''An Introduction to Language Crime and the Law''. London: Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death row statements===
Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.
The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.

===Social media===
Social media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=C.S. Michell|year=2013|title=Investigating the use of forensic stylistic and stylometric techniques in the analysis of authorship on a publicly accessible social networking site (Facebook)|degree=MA in Linguistics|publisher=University of South Africa|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/13324/dissertation_michell_cs.pdf?sequence=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).&lt;ref&gt;C. Hardaker (2015). The ethics of online aggression: Where does “virtual” end, and “reality” begin? BAAL Conference on The Ethics of Online Research Methods. Cardiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings==
These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:
* [[Trademark]] and other intellectual property disputes
* Disputes of meaning and use
* Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails)
* Forensic stylistics (identifying cases of [[plagiarism]])
* [[Voice identification]], also known as forensic phonetics, used to determine, through acoustic qualities, if the voice on a tape recorder is that of the defendant)
* [[Discourse analysis]] (the analysis of the structure of written or spoken utterance to determine who is introducing topics or whether a suspect is agreeing to engage in criminal conspiracy)
* Language analysis (forensic [[dialectology]]) tracing the linguistic history of [[asylum seeker]]s ([[Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin]])&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter" /&gt;
* Reconstruction of mobile phone text conversations
* Forensic phonetics

Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called [[text corpus|corpora]]) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).

===Author identification===
The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their [[idiolect]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, M. (2004). Author identification, idiolect and linguistic uniqueness. ''Applied Linguistics'', 25(4), 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. [[William Labov]] has stated that nobody has found a "homogenous data" in idiolects,&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (1972) ''Sociolinguistic patterns''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p192.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.

Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, pp 151-167&lt;/ref&gt; Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, T. D. (2008). Approaching questions in forensic authorship analysis. In J. Gibbons &amp; M. T. Turell (Eds.), ''Dimensions of Forensic Linguistics''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.

Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, [[Article (grammar)|article]] frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of [[hapax legomena]] (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include [[factor analysis]], [[Bayesian statistics]], [[Poisson distribution]], [[multivariate analysis]], and [[discriminant function analysis]] of function words.

The Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A.Q., and S. Michaelson (1990) ''The Qsum Plot''. Internal Report CSR-3-90, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.

In order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.

===Forensic stylistics===
This discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship, in identifying [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does forensic linguistics/stylistics work in criminal issues? Answers|website=enotes.com|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/linguistics-forensic-stylistics|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect [[plagiarism]] was the case of [[Helen Keller]]'s short story "[[The Frost King]]", in which the blind American author was accused of [[plagiarism]] in 1892. An investigation revealed that [[The Frost King]] had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's ''Frost Fairies'' which had been read to Keller some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamenjivarblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/when-helen-froze-over/|title=WHEN HELEN FROZE OVER|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that Keller had made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of 'treasure' (approximately 230 times less common in the language) 'bethought' instead of 'concluded' (approximately 450 times less common), 'bade them' instead of 'told them' (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase 'ever since that time' whilst Canby chose 'from that time' (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used ' I cannot imagine' whereas Canby used ' I do not know'. 'Know' is approximately ten times more common than 'imagine'. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common when compared to Canby's. The Flesch and [[Flesch-Kincaid]] readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality compared to Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level.

Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between [[Richard Condon]], author of [[The Manchurian Candidate]] and English novelist [[Robert Graves]] and between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', Condon's work is seen to be rich in clichés such as ''"in his superstitious heart of hearts."'' While [[Helen Keller]] took pride in using rare phrases and avoids common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt; However, in the plagiarism case between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Boston U. Panel Finds Plagiarism by Dr. King | date= 11 October 1991|accessdate=2008-06-14|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD61030F932A25753C1A967958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Another famous example is the case of [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who was eventually convicted of being the "Unabomber", family members recognized his writing style from the published 35,000-word ''[[wikisource:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'' (commonly called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, J. R. (2004). "Using a forensic linguistic approach to tracking the Unabomber." In J. Campbell, &amp; D. DeNevi (Eds.)''Profilers: Leading investigators take you inside the criminal mind'' (pp. 193-222). New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with each other.&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007" /&gt;

===Discourse analysis===
[[Discourse analysis]] deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant [[semiotic]] event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Linguistic dialectology===
This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect.

Dialectology was used during the investigations into the [[Wearside Jack|Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fido (1994), ''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic phonetics===
The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings.  Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal.

A man accused of manufacturing the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic'&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007"&gt;Coulthard, M., &amp; Johnson, A. (2007). ''An introduction to forensic linguistics: Language in evidence''. Oxford: Routledge:162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police transcriber heard ''"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue."'' However, the actual utterance was ''"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue."''

Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt;

[[Forensic speechreading]] is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.

===Examples===
Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of [[hate mail]]; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of [[Derek Bentley]] the identification of [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' charismatic leader by [[Max Appedole]] and the identification of [[Theodore Kaczynski]] as the so-called "[[Unabomber]]" by [[James R. Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/manhunt-unabomber-fbi-ted-kaczynski-james-fitzgerald-643594|title='Manhunt: Unabomber' explores how a federal investigator caught Ted Kaczynski and changed FBI profiling forever|date=2017-07-29|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal laboratories ''Bundeskriminalamt'' (in Germany) and the ''Nederlands Forensisch Instituut'' (in the [[Netherlands]]) both employ forensic linguists.&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageandlaw.org/FORENSIC.HTM|title=forensic linguistics|first=peter|last=tiersma|website=www.languageandlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of [[Derek Bentley]]'s conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]], had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken [[monologue]]. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word "then" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, R.M. (2000). " ''Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship'' ", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life''. London, Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the [[Mexican government]] speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf «El otro subcomandante»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tZRlQk_8s»]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in [[Tampico]], [[Tamaulipas]] to [[Spain|Spanish]] immigrants, an [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the [[Instituto Cultural Tampico]], made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzUQqpDptm8»]&lt;/ref&gt; Rafael Guillén, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an [[idiolect]], encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=243839|title=Marcos, en la mira de Zedillo - Proceso|date=5 August 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&amp;article=12183«Marcos Sí es Sebastián Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf«La Otra Campana Pintada de Azul»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&amp;rl=wh« Maestros y condiscípulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in [[Yorkshire]]. After she was reported missing, her partner received several [[text message]]s from Julie's mobile phone, such as "Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out", and "Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/12file-text.html Speech Patterns in Messages Betray a Killer], Elizabeth Svoboda, ''[[New York Times]]'' May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197187/Dear-Garry-Ive-decided-end-The-stop-trapped-killer.html Dear Garry.

19-year old [[Murder of Jenny Nicholl|Jenny Nicholl]] disappeared on 30 June 2005. [[Murder conviction without a body|Her body was never found]], giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's [[Murder|murderer]], David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elizabeth|title=The case for forensic linguistics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7600769.stm|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2008|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;Trial of Rehan Asghar, Central Criminal Court, London, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the appeal against the conviction of the [[Bridgewater Four]], the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a confession which he had retracted immediately&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.

In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a "farewell letter" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, [[markedness|marked]] [[Thematic relation|themes]], and deletion of [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleson, Robert. (1994). 'Forensic analysis of personal written texts: a case study', John Gibbons (ed.), ''Language and the Law'', London: Longman, 362&amp;ndash;373.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day – long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of [[Murder|murder]] and get justice for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxmbk/forensic-linguists-use-spelling-mistakes-to-help-convict-criminals|title=Forensic Linguists Use Spelling Mistakes to Help Convict Criminals|date=9 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional concepts==

===Linguistic fingerprinting===
A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;  It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone).&lt;ref&gt;Pennebaker, J. W. (1990). 'Physiological factors influencing the reporting of physical symptoms'. ''The Science of Self-report: Implications for Research and Practice.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Publishers, pp. 299-316&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Variation===
Intra-author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.
*'''Genre:''' When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author.
*'''Text Type:''' Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers.
*'''Fiction vs. Non-Fiction:''' Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation.
*'''Private vs Public:''' A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text,  will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member.
*'''Time lapse:''' The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us.
*'''Disguise:''' A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition.

===Forensic transcription===
The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily.  Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/opinion/recording-police-questioning.html | work=The New York Times | title=Recording Police Questioning | date=15 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glik v. Cunniffe''''', 655 [[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] 78 (1st Cir. 2011) is a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public officials in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a [[wiretapping]] violation violated his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then [[lawsuit|sued]] the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.

In a unanimous decision, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] held that the officers violated Glik's constitutional rights and that the officers were not entitled to [[qualified immunity]]. The Court ruled that the right to film public officials in public places was "clearly established," and that Glik's actions did not violate state law. However, the court also ruled that the right to film public officials was subject to reasonable limitations with respect to the time, place and manner in which the recording was conducted. After losing the appeal, Boston reached a settlement with Glik in which they agreed to pay him $170,000 in damages and attorney's fees. This was the first case in which a [[United States courts of appeals|United States Circuit Court of Appeals]] explicitly ruled that private citizens have a right to film police officers in public spaces. The case drew media attention across the United States, and was also cited favorably by other United States Circuit Courts of Appeals that reached similar conclusions in other cases.

== Opinion of the court ==
[[File:MoakleyFederalCourthouseRear.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|right|The [[John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse]] (pictured) is the headquarters of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where Glik's appeal was heard.]]&lt;br&gt;
In a unanimous decision written by Judge [[Kermit Lipez]], the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that the officers violated Glik's constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 79, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted the principle of qualified immunity balanced the need to hold public officials accountable with the need to shield such officials from harassment on account of their public duties.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 81; Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1551.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court therefore applied a two-part test: first, did the facts alleged by the plaintiff show a violation of a constitutional right, and second, was the right clearly established at the time of the violation.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 81; Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1551–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court first addressed the question of whether Glik's First Amendment rights had been violated.  It noted that "we have previously recognized that the videotaping of public officials is an exercise of First Amendment liberties"&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 81.&lt;/ref&gt; and held that Glik had a constitutional right to videotape a public official in a public place.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1550–1551.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court noted that this was not limited to [[Journalist|reporters and journalists]], but a right of all citizens, subject to reasonable limitations of time, place and manner.  The First Circuit concluded that in the current case, none of those limitations applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 84; Lautt, 51 {{smallcaps|Washburn L.J.}} at 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the court looked at whether the right to videotape was clearly established at the time of the arrest.  The court had "no trouble concluding that 'the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant&lt;nowiki&gt;[s] fair warning that [their]&lt;/nowiki&gt; particular conduct was unconstitutional.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 81; Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1552 (brackets in original).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court noted that some constitution violations are "self-evident"&lt;ref name="Glik"&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 85; Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1555.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to film public officials in a public place was clearly established&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1550–1551; Van Tassell, 2013 {{smallcaps|B.Y.U. L. Rev.}} at 183.&lt;/ref&gt; a decade prior to Glik's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Potere, at 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, the court determined if Glik's Fourth Amendment rights had been violated.  The court noted that an arrest must be based upon [[probable cause]].  Glik argued that the officers lacked probable cause when they made the arrest, while the officers argued that the allegations in the complaint established that they had probable cause to arrest Glik for violating the wiretap statute.&lt;ref name="Glik" /&gt;  The court looked to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] for the determination of state law.  The Massachusetts court required that the recording be made secretly to be a violation, and that when a camera was in plain sight, a recording from that camera cannot be considered "secret" under state law.  In Glik's case, the criminal complaint stated that he had "openly record[ed] the police officers",&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 85 (brackets in original).&lt;/ref&gt; the recording was not made in secret, and that therefore the officers had no probable cause to arrest Glik.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} at 1556.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since there was no probable cause, Glik's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 88; Van Tassell, 2013 {{smallcaps|B.Y.U. L. Rev.}} at 183; Marianne F. Kies, ''[http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/80-1-Kies.pdf Policing the Police: Freedom of the Press, the Right to Privacy, and Civilian Recordings of Police Activity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228142101/http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/80-1-Kies.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}'', 80 {{smallcaps|Geo. Wash. L. Rev.}} 274 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the court determined that the absence of probable cause as a constitutional violation was clearly established in law.  The court therefore held that the district court's denial of the officers of qualified immunity was proper, affirming the decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Glik'', 655 F.3d at 89; Barfield, 7; Lautt, 51 {{smallcaps|Washburn L.J.}} at 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
Despite his victory in court, the case had negative repercussions for Glik, an attorney, who had difficulty obtaining employment as a prosecutor while criminal charges were pending against him.  He is now a criminal defense lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Dustin F. Robinson, ''[http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2012/04/Robinson.pdf Bad Footage: Surveillance Laws, Police Misconduct, and the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031010358/http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2012/04/Robinson.pdf |date=2012-10-31 }}'', 100 {{smallcaps|Geo. L.J.}} 1399, 1409 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  After losing the appeal, Boston settled the lawsuit for $170,000, paying Glik for damages and legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, 33 {{smallcaps|N. Ill. U. L. Rev.}} at 489; Timothy B. Lee, ''[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/boston-pd-admits-arrest-for-cell-phone-recording-was-a-mistake/ Boston PD Admits Arrest for Cell Phone Recording was a Mistake]'', Ars Technica (Jan. 10, 2012); ''Boston Settled Police Videotaping Lawsuit'', Boston Globe, Mar. 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the city reversed its earlier opinion that the officers had done nothing wrong, stating that the officers had shown "unreasonable judgement" by arresting Glik.  In 2012, a Boston Police Department spokesperson stated that the officers involved in the case stood to face "discipline ranging from an oral reprimand to suspension".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B. Lee, [https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/boston-pd-admits-arrest-for-cell-phone-recording-was-a-mistake/ ''Boston PD Admits Arrest for Cell Phone Recording was a Mistake''], {{smallcaps|Ars Technica}} (Jan 10, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boston Police Department now trains its officers not to arrest people for openly recording them in public.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B. Lee, ''[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/boston-pays-170k-to-settle-cell-phone-recording-lawsuit/ Boston Pays $170K to Settle Cell Phone Recording Lawsuit]'', Ars Technica (Mar. 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar cases in other courts of appeals ==
Some scholars have identified ''Glik'' as the first  case in which a [[United States courts of appeals|United States Circuit Court of Appeals]] explicitly held that a citizen had the same rights as a journalist to record public officials in a public place,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Kies, 80 {{smallcaps|Geo. Wash. L. Rev.}} at 274.&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have identified earlier rulings by circuit courts that have upheld a right of "publicly gathering information" while filming the police.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory T. Frohman, ''[http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=caselrev What Is and What Should Never Be: Examining the Artificial Circuit "Split" on Citizens Recording Official Police Action]'', 64 {{smallcaps|Cas. W. Res. L. Rev.}} 1897, 1920–21 (2014) (citing ''Fordyce v. City of Seattle'', 55 F.3d 436 (9th Cir. 1995)) (internal quotations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, scholars generally consider ''Glik'' to be the first case to "tackle the issue of police recording in the smartphone era".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory T. Frohman, ''[http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=caselrev What Is and What Should Never Be: Examining the Artificial Circuit "Split" on Citizens Recording Official Police Action]'', 64 {{smallcaps|Cas. W. Res. L. Rev.}} 1897, 1922 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the First Circuit's ruling, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] granted an [[injunction]] prohibiting the State of [[Illinois]] from enforcing its wiretapping law against citizens openly recording public officials in public places.  Citing ''Glik'', the Seventh Circuit stated that "applying the statute in the circumstances alleged here is likely unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;''American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois v. Alvarez'', 679 F.3d 583, 608 (7th Cir. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the First and the Seventh Circuits, both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals have held that the public has a First Amendment right to record public officials.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, 33 {{smallcaps|N. Ill. U. L. Rev.}} at 533–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, in ''Smith v. City of Cumming'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] held that the First Amendment protects the right of citizens to film  the police.&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v. City of Cumming'', 212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in 1995, in ''Fordyce v. City of Seattle'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] held that a private citizen could film police conduct at a protest because the First Amendment protects the "right to film matters of public interest".&lt;ref&gt;''Fordyce v. City of Seattle'', 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]] in ''Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;''Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle'', 622 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]] in ''Szymecki v. Houck'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;''Szymecki v. Houck'', 353 F. App’x 852 (4th Cir. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; have held that even if the constitution protects the right to film the police, such a right was "not clearly established for the purposes of [[qualified immunity]] in those cases’ factual contexts".&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Volokh, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/14/first-amendment-generally-protects-videorecording-of-police-and-this-right-is-clearly-established/ First Amendment generally protects videorecording of police, and this right is ‘clearly established’]'', {{smallcaps|The Washington Post}} (May 14, 2015) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Gregory T. Frohman, ''[http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=caselrev What Is and What Should Never Be: Examining the Artificial Circuit "Split" on Citizens Recording Official Police Action]'', 64 {{smallcaps|Cas. W. Res. L. Rev.}} 1897, 1954 (2014) (noting that "[t]wo circuits declined to definitively answer the issue").&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] ruled in ''[[Turner v. Driver]]'' (2017) that while the officers were entitled to qualified immunity in that case, the First Amendment protects the right to record police, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Turner v. Driver]]'', [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/16-10312/16-10312-2017-02-16.html No. 16-10312] (5th Cir. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest these various rulings present the potential for a [[circuit split]] in cases that involve the filming of police conduct,&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, 33 {{smallcaps|N. Ill. U. L. Rev.}} at 532.&lt;/ref&gt; while others have described the different rulings among circuit courts as " an artificial split—not on the merits of the First Amendment right violated, but on technical qualified immunity ground".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory T. Frohman, ''[http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=caselrev What Is and What Should Never Be: Examining the Artificial Circuit "Split" on Citizens Recording Official Police Action]'', 64 {{smallcaps|Cas. W. Res. L. Rev.}} 1897, 1954 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===District court opinions===
In February 2016, Judge [[Mark A. Kearney]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] ruled in ''Fields v. City of Philadelphia'' that "observing and recording" police is not [[Freedom of speech in the United States#Expressive conduct|expressive conduct]] under the First Amendment and is therefore not protected by the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields v. City of Philadelphia'', [http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/16d0151p.pdf No. 14-4424], slip. op. (E.D. Penn. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have noted that this opinion "breaks with consensus among federal courts",&lt;ref name = Bates&gt;Adam Bates, [http://www.newsweek.com/videoing-police-protected-first-amendment-430370 ''Is Video Recording Police Protected by the First Amendment?''], {{smallcaps|Newsweek}}, February 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the case marked "the first time a federal court has ''not'' found that recording cops while on duty and in a public setting is protected by the First Amendment".&lt;ref&gt;Radley Balko, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/23/federal-judge-recording-cops-isnt-necessarily-protected-by-the-first-amendment/ ''Federal judge: Recording cops isn’t necessarily protected by the First Amendment''], {{smallcaps|The Washington Post}}, February 23, 2016 (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Volokh]] also stated that the case is inconsistent with precedent from other federal circuit courts.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Volokh, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/23/no-first-amendment-right-to-videorecord-police-unless-you-are-challenging-the-police-at-the-time/ ''Court: No First Amendment right to videorecord police unless you are challenging the police at the time''], {{smallcaps|The Washington Post}}, February 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the court's opinion, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] announced that it would [[appeal]] the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].&lt;ref name = Bates/&gt;

== Commentary and analysis ==
The case drew national media attention, prompting editorials from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Turley, ''Your Right to Record'', Los Angeles Times, Nov. 8, 2011, at A23.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''A Vital Liberty'', N.Y. Times, Sept. 2, 2011, at A22.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.  The case has also drawn notice in the legal community, with articles in the [[American Bar Association]] Journal&lt;ref&gt;David L. Hudson Jr., ''Good Cop, Bad Citizen? As Cellphone Recording Increases, Officers Are Uneasy'', A.B.A.J., Mar. 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Volokh Conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Volokh, ''[http://www.volokh.com/2011/08/29/first-amendment-right-to-openly-record-police-officers-in-public/ First Amendment Right to Openly Record Police Officers in Public]'', Volokh Conspiracy (Aug. 29, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[United States Department of Justice]] cited the Glik case extensively in a letter to the [[Baltimore Police Department]] expressing concerns over policies dealing with officer interactions with citizen photographers and videographers.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Zetter, ''[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/justice-dept-defends-publics-constitutional-right-to-record-cops/ Justice Dept. Defends Public’s Constitutional ‘Right to Record’ Cops]'', Ars Technica (May 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Commentary from [[law journals]] also discussed the lasting impact of the case.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jesse Harlan Alderman, ''[http://www.niu.edu/law/_pdfs/law-review/issues/full_issues/33_3/Alderman%201.pdf Before You Press Record: Unanswered Questions Surrounding the First Amendment Right to Film Public Police Activity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227141033/http://www.niu.edu/law/_pdfs/law-review/issues/full_issues/33_3/Alderman%201.pdf |date=2015-12-27 }}'', 33 {{smallcaps|N. Ill. U. L. Rev.}} 485, 487 (2013) (discussing the case's impact).&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''Case Western Reserve Law Review'', Gregory T. Frohman wrote that the court's ruling "seemingly laid down a nearly unfettered right for nonthreatening third-party recorders in public places".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory T. Frohman, ''[http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=caselrev What Is and What Should Never Be: Examining the Artificial Circuit "Split" on Citizens Recording Official Police Action]'', 64 {{smallcaps|Cas. W. Res. L. Rev.}} 1897, 1923 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''Northern Illinois University Law Review'', Jesse Harlan Alderman wrote that "[t]hough ''Glik'' and ''Alvarez'' hold sway only  within  their  respective  jurisdictions, it  seems  likely  that  the  right  to record  public  police  activity  will  be  treated  as  universal".&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Harlan Alderman, ''[http://www.niu.edu/law/_pdfs/law-review/issues/full_issues/33_3/Alderman%201.pdf Before You Press Record: Unanswered Questions Surrounding the First Amendment Right to Film Public Police Activity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227141033/http://www.niu.edu/law/_pdfs/law-review/issues/full_issues/33_3/Alderman%201.pdf |date=2015-12-27 }}'', 33 {{smallcaps|N. Ill. U. L. Rev.}} 485, 487 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Giffin, writing for the ''[[Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review]]'', observed that the case "could play a significant role in solidifying the emerging consensus that citizens have a constitutional interest in monitoring the activities of police officers".&lt;ref&gt;Matt Giffin, ''[http://harvardcrcl.org/first-circuit-affirms-right-to-record-the-police/ First Circuit Affirms Right to Record the Police]'', {{smallcaps|Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in an article for the ''[[Cardozo Law Review]]'', Travis S. Triano noted that the Court's ruling emphasized that "Glik’s filming was found to fall well within the bounds of constitutional protections".&lt;ref&gt;Travis S. Triano, ''[http://cardozolawreview.com/content/34-1/Triano.34.1.pdf Who Watches the Watchmen? Big Brother's Use of Wiretap Statutes to Place Civilians in Time Out]'', 34 {{smallcaps|Cardozo L. Rev.}} 389, 399 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other analysts have questioned whether the First Circuit's ruling would, in fact, have a widespread impact in the future.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Caycee Hampton, ''[http://www.floridalawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Hampton_BOOK.pdf Confirmation of a Catch-22: Glik v. Cunniffe and the Paradox of Citizen Recording]'', 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} 1549, 1559 (2011) (questioning the future applicability of the case).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an article in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' noted that the First Circuit's ruling in ''Glik'' was evidence of the court's willingness to protect a "vital First Amendment right", but that "the proliferation of body cameras may make civilians feel as if they no longer need to record officers in the field".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Considering-Body-Cameras.pdf Considering Police Body Cameras]'', 128 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 1794, 1815–16 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[Florida Law Review]]'', Caycee Hampton criticized the First Circuit for providing "no guidance  for  determining  what  situations  constitute a  'public  space'  in which  a  citizen’s  right  to  film  government  officials  is  safeguarded  by the   First   Amendment", and absent such guidance, "citizens who choose to record law enforcement officials  risk  inviting  the  same  Fourth  Amendment  violation  confirmed in ''Glik''".&lt;ref&gt;Caycee Hampton, ''[http://www.floridalawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Hampton_BOOK.pdf Confirmation of a Catch-22: Glik v. Cunniffe and the Paradox of Citizen Recording]'', 63 {{smallcaps|Fla. L. Rev.}} 1549, 1559 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in an article in the ''St. Louis University Law Journal'', Justin Welply argued that the right to film the police is not absolute, and that "an individual has a First Amendment right to openly record police conduct in a public park, but does not have an established First Amendment right to openly record officers in the discharge of their duties during a traffic stop" because filming the police during a traffic stop may interfere with their ability to work effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Welply, ''[http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/Law%20Journal/Archives/Welply_Article.pdf When, Where and Why the First Amendment Protects the Right to Record Police Communications: A Substantial Interference Guideline for Determining the Scope of the Right to Record and for Revamping Restrictive State Wiretapping Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129213254/http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/Law%20Journal/Archives/Welply_Article.pdf |date=2016-01-29 }}'', 57 {{smallcaps|St. Louis U.

'''Information policy''' is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;Weingarten, F.W. (1989) Federal Information Policy Development: The Congressional perspective. In C. McClure, P. Hernon and H. Relyea (eds), United States Government Information Policies: views and Perspectives (Ablex, Norwood, NJ).&lt;/ref&gt; It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"&gt;Braman, S. (2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.

== Overview ==

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”

Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], law, and public policy.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s.  The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations.  The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies.  Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/braman/www/bramanpdfs/027_Braman_Chapt1.pdf |title=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |publisher=Pantherfile.uwm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.

== Types and importance ==

The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories.  It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science.  It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology.  More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks).  As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation.  Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).  Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management
 
3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information

4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments

== Issues ==

There are some issues around organizational information policies,&lt;ref&gt;Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R &amp; D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"&gt;(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks.  Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt; As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanchak, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"&gt;(Reisinger, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]]. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"/&gt; For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;(Houck, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt;

== Internet governance ==

Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"&gt;Solum, 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"/&gt;

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"&gt;(Solum, 2008, 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"/&gt; It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.
 
Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 48)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==

Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

=== Security vs freedom of information ===

A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information.  Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties.  The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include:&lt;ref name=EPIC&gt;{{cite web|title=USA PATRIOT Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress.  Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==

The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:

Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.

Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).

Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. 
Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.

Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The future ==

In regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.  As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;  It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009).  The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011).  As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009).  The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

India has a recent history of judicial activism, originating after [[The Emergency (India)|the emergency in India]] which saw attempts by the Government to [[The Emergency (India)#Tendency to control Judiciary|control the judiciary.]] [[Public Interest Litigation]] was thus an instrument devised by the courts to reach out directly to the public, and take [[judicial notice|cognizance]] though the litigant may not be the victim. [[Sua sponte|"Suo motu"]] cognizance allows the courts to take up such cases on its own. The trend has been supported as well criticized.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} New York Times author [[Gardiner Harris]] sums this up as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/asia/court-restores-indias-ban-on-gay-sex.html?hp&amp;_r=2&amp; | work=The New York Times | first=Gardiner | last=Harris | title=India's Supreme Court Restores an 1861 Law Banning Gay Sex | date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of North America is diverse and influential. The [[law of the United States]] has worldwide renown, in its codified constitution, and [[bill of rights]], while the [[law of Cuba]] differs vastly in its regulation of private property. The first court of justice was established in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] in 1615 by Sir [[Richard Whitbourne]] as a [[court of admiralty]] at the future site of [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/canada/Alberta-to-Nova-Scotia/Newfoundland-and-Labrador.html |title=Newfoundland and Labrador |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Nations Encyclopedia |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''Law in action''' is a [[legal theory]], associated with [[legal realism]], that examines the role of [[law]], not just as it exists in the [[statute]]s and [[Case law|cases]], but as it is actually applied in [[society]]. Law in action [[scholar]]s often start with observations about the behavior of [[institution]]s and work "backwards" toward the legal philosophies guiding [[court]]s and traditional [[jurisprudence]]. As [[Kenneth B. Davis, Jr.]], Dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] has stated, "'Law in Action' . . . means that in teaching and research, no matter how interesting we find a legal theory, we always need to ask, 'How does this affect people's lives in the real world?'"

== History ==
The first reference to Law in Action may have been a 1910 article by [[Roscoe Pound]], the [[Harvard Law School]] dean whose work was a forerunner to the legal realism movement.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;[http://www.law.wisc.edu/law-in-action/davislawinactionessay.html Law in Action: The Dean's View - University of Wisconsin Law School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the concept caught hold at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]], where the law in action concept is most prevalent today. The law in action concept was a natural fit for Wisconsin because of its strong emphasis on the social sciences and the [[Wisconsin Idea]]—the concept that the boundaries of campus are the boundaries of the state.

== Teaching law in action ==

As at law schools everywhere, the focus is on appellate opinions. However, a professor who focuses on law in action is likely to go past the holding of the case to look at more questions such as "How might the parties on the losing end of the case respond?" "Will the rule change their future behavior?" "Who will enforce the rule?" or "What was the cause of the underlying dispute?" will be addressed &lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Similarly, clinical education and clinical skills courses take on a more important role for students, who get to integrate their personal experiences with the classroom work.

==History==
The legal education in the Philippines was first introduced during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish occupation]] when, in 1734, the [[University of Santo Tomas]] established the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]].&lt;ref name="Mariano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellanolaw.edu/alpr/v4n1c.pdf |title=The State of Philippine Legal Education Revisited |last=Magsalin |first=Mariano Jr. |date=July 2003 |publisher=''[[Arellano University School of Law]]'' |type=PDF |access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Malolos Constitution]] was ratified, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established by Joaquin Gonzales in 1899; the said institution offered several courses including law. However, the Literaria's existence was short lived as a result of the eruption of the [[Philippine–American War|Filipino-American conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=%2522Universidad+Literaria+de+Filipinas%2522+law+education&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522Universidad%2520Literaria%2520de%2520Filipinas%2522%2520law%2520education |title=Philippine History |last=Halili |first=M. c |date=2004 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc. |isbn=9789712339349 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation]], specifically in 1911, the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] was established, through the vision and efforts of [[George A. Malcolm|George Malcolm]]. The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.&lt;ref name="Mariano"/&gt;

The ratification of the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the [[Department of Public Instruction]]). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|University of the Philippines–College of Law]], the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the [[Philippine Law School]] were the leading law institutions during those period. After [[World War II]] and in the contemporary time, more law schools were then established.&lt;ref name="Mariano"/&gt;

===Legal Education Board===
The Legal Education Board supervises all law schools and continuing legal education providers in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1993/ra_7662_1993.html |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7662: Legal Education Reform Act of 1993. |date=December 23, 1993 |website=Lawphil.net |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board is headed by a Chairman who is a retired justice of a collegiate court (i.e., Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, etc.). Regular members of the Board include a representative from each of the following:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

*[[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] (IBP)
*Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS)
*Philippine Association of Law Professors (PALP)
*active law practitioners
*bona fide law students

The Board has made legal reforms which include—the stricter selection of law students and law professors; improvements in quality of instruction and facilities of law schools; provisions for legal apprenticeship of law students; and the requirement of attendance to continuing legal education seminars for practicing attorneys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Mandatory Continuing Legal Education===
Lawyers with names appearing in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court'', unless disbarred, are all members of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] (IBP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/bm_850.htm |title=B.M. 850. October 2, 2001:  MANDATORY CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION - A RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE REVISED RULES ON THE CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES |date=August 22, 2000 |website=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to be IBP members of good standing, lawyers are required to complete, every three years, at least thirty-six hours of continuing legal education seminars approved by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Committee (MCLE). Members who fail to comply shall pay a non-compliance fee, and shall be listed as a delinquent member.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobleslawnet.com/index.php/resources/55 |title=ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER No. 113-2003 : ESTABLISHING THE MANDATORY CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION OFFICE |date=August 5, 2003 |website=Chan Robles Law Net |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office, established by the Supreme Court, is the official government agency tasked to implement compliance with the MCLE requirement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The MCLE Office is headed by former Supreme Court Justice Carolina C. Grino-Aquino, widow of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ramon Aquino. Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.

== Legal systems==
The Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include the [[Roman law|Roman]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] which was inherited from Spain;  the [[Law of the United States|Anglo-American]] [[common law]] which were derived from the laws of the United States; and [[Islamic law]] otherwise known as the [[Shariah law]] of the Muslim world, [[Private law]] and [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]] are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while the [[Public Law]], including the [[Political law]], is based on Anglo-American legal system.

==Law degree programs==
Law degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a [[bachelor's degree]], with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Passing the Philippine Law School Admission Test or PhilSAT &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/admissions/graduate/_pdf/lebmo-11-s2016.pdf LEB Memorandum Order 7, series of 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

Law degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types—professional, graduate level, and honorary.

===Professional law degrees===
In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete one of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.

*'''[[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.)''' – The LL.B. is the most common law degree offered and conferred by Philippine law schools. It is a standard four-year law program covering all bar exam subjects. Almost all law schools follow a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. Other schools, like the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]], allow students to substitute electives for bar review subjects  offered in the fourth year of study.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"&gt;Curriculum models, ''Philippine Association of Law Schools'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.)''' - The J.D. degree was developed and first conferred in the Philippines by the [[Ateneo Law School]] in 1991. The J.D. program is a four-year law program. Like the standard LL.B. program, the J.D. curriculum covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. Unlike the LL.B., the Ateneo J.D. program requires students to finish the core bar subjects in 2{{sfrac|1|2}} years, take elective subjects, undergo an apprenticeship, and prepare and defend a thesis.&lt;ref name="clv1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&amp;PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |title=Philippine Leadership Crisis and the J.D. Program |last=Villanueva |first=Cesar L. |date=September 27, 2007 |website=[[Ateneo Law School]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204011/http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&amp;PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, many of the law schools in the Philippines now offer the Juris Doctor program instead of the LL.B or the Bachelors of Law program.
**'''[[Juris Doctor]]&amp;ndash;[[Master of Business Administration]], (J.D.-M.B.A.)''', – The J.D.-M.B.A. program is a [[double degree]] program in law and management offered at the professional-graduate level. It was introduced and is so far offered only by the La Salle-FEU MBA-JD Program, a consortium of [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]] and [[De La Salle Professional Schools|De La Salle Graduate School of Business]]. Under this program, the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs are satisfied by the taking of concurrent units of study, allowing students to complete the program in five instead of six years.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"/&gt;

===Graduate law degrees===
Beyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.

*'''[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.)''' – The LL.M. is a graduate law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any nationality. Six Philippine law schools so far conduct the program—the [[Ateneo Law School]], which offers an International Master of Laws program; the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]], which first offered the LL.M.; San Sebastian College - Recoletos Graduate School of Law; [[University of Manila]] College of Law; [[Manuel L. Quezon University]] College of Law; [[Central Philippine University College of Law]] in Consortium with [[San Beda College]]; [[San Beda College of Law|San Beda Graduate School of Law]]; and [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] of the ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by  the [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]], the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] but were eventually phased out due to lack of enrollment and funding.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"/&gt;
*'''[[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.)''' – The D.C.L. program is a doctoral program in law offered to holders of the LL.M. degree. Candidates who hold only LL.B. degrees may be admitted upon completion of prerequisite LL.M. subjects. The D.C.L. was pioneered by the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]]. Their program structure is highly similar to the D.C.L. offered in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Prospectus, Law Department, ''University of Santo Tomas Graduate School'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] has already opened its own D.C.L. program.&lt;ref&gt;List of programs, ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.)''' – The S.J.D. or J.S.D. program is currently offered only by the San Beda Graduate School of Law.  While the candidate for the degree is required some academic units, the grant of the degree relies on the candidates research output as well as his or her participation in international symposia, seminars and programs as lecturer, panel presenter or paper presenter. The candidate presents a doctoral dissertation that is argued before a Panel of Oral Examiners and then delivers a 'lectio coram' -- a lecture in the presence of legal luminaries.

===Honorary law degrees===
Some Philippine universities also confer the [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.

===Ecclesiastical law degrees===
A few [[Roman Catholic]] seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in [[canon law]], an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s.The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies|University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law]] runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its '''[[Licentiate of Canon Law]] (J.C.L.)''' and '''[[Doctor of Canon Law]] (J.C.D.)''' programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Official prospectus, ''University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.

===Developments===
There is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula.&lt;ref name="clv1"/&gt; There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from "LL.B." to "J.D." while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).&lt;ref name="clv1"/&gt;

==Admission to the practice of law==
The 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 5, Article VIII, The Philippine Constitution, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.

To be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2, 5-6; Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: 
# completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; 
# recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; 
# completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government; and
# must have completed a separate bachelor's degree."

===Bar examinations===
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}
The [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alexander L. Lacson. "A Nation Under Lawyers." ''The Practice: Business and Leisure Magazine for Lawyers''. August–September 2004 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reputedly one of the hardest bar examinations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Reports made by members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates intending to practice Islamic law in the Philippines, the ''Special Bar Exams for Shari'a Court Lawyers'' is given every two years. The Supreme Court Bar Office conducts the exam while the Office of Muslim Affairs determines the qualification and eligibility of candidates to the exams.&lt;ref&gt;Court En Banc Resolution, Supreme Court of the Philippines, September 20, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attorneys-at-law ===
To be a full-fledged lawyer in the Philippines and be eligible to use the title ''Attorney'', a candidate must graduate from a Philippine law school, take and pass the Philippine Bar Examinations, the candidate who passed the bar examinations is entitled to take and subscribe before the Supreme Court special en banc session the corresponding Attorney's Oath, as follows:

{{cquote|''I,_______________, do solemnly swear that I will maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, I will support the Constitution and obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities therein; I will do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, or give aid nor consent to the same; I will delay no man for money or malice, and will conduct myself as a lawyer according to the best of my knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients; and I impose upon myself these voluntary obligations without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God.''}}

The certificate to practice law will be granted by the Supreme Court after the lawyer sign his name in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legal Profession'', a lecture delivered by Associate Justice Edgardo F. Sundiam of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]], Ateneo School of Law, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The full names of lawyers are found in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court'', and in a similar list included in a Supreme Court publication entitled ''Law List.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/baradmission/lawlist/index.php |title=Law List |website=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine law schools==
Starting from 2017, the Legal Education Board had started implementing the Philippine Law School Admission Test &lt;small&gt;(PhilSAT)&lt;/small&gt;; the failure to pass such admission test prohibits a person from enrolling to any law schools in the Philippines. It is a one-day aptitude test intended to measure the academic potential of an examinee who wishes to pursue the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/03/17/philsat-entrance-exam-for-aspiring-law-students-starts-this-year |title=PhilSAT: Entrance exam for aspiring law students starts this year |date=February 3, 2017 |website=ABS-CBN News |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017}}, there are 108 law schools&lt;ref&gt;Milagros Santos-Ong, Office of the Director of Library Services, ''Supreme Court of the Philippines''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">'''Legal ghostwriting''' is a form of [[unbundled legal services]] in the United States in which an [[Lawyer|attorney]] drafts a document on behalf of a client without formally appearing before the [[court]]. Instead, the client represents his or herself [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|''pro se'']].

==Purpose==

The growth of ''pro se'' [[litigants]] can be attributed to the high cost of litigation, anti-lawyer sentiment, and the advent of [[do-it-yourself]] law services. However, self-represented litigants may still need [[legal representation]] in order and to navigate the [[litigation]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|date=February 2002|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Legal [[ghostwriting]] is one way in which clients can receive legal counsel while maintaining control of their case and avoiding higher legal costs. Attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services often charge a flat fee rather than billing by the hour as is typical for full-service attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalghostwriting.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Bar Association==

The [[American Bar Association|ABA]] formally endorsed the delivery of legal ghostwriting services by attorneys to ''pro se'' clients in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ethics and Professional Responsibility|first=Standing Committee on|title=Formal Opinion 07-446|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|work=Undisclosed Legal Assistance to Pro Se Litigants|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a formal opinion, the ABA deemed the practice consistent with Rule 1.2(c) of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] which allows lawyers to unbundle their services to clients. According to the ABA opinion paper, lawyers should generally disclose the fact that papers were prepared by an attorney, but need not disclose their name of firm.

==New York==

The New York County Law Association agreed with the ABA approach to legal ghostwriting in a 2010 ethics opinion paper. In that decision, NYCLA found that “…it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litigant without disclosing the lawyer’s participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‘where necessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Professional Ethics|first=Committee on|title=Opinion 742|url=http://www.nycla.org/siteFiles/Publications/Publications1348_0.pdf|work=NYCLA|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Second Circuit court in 2011 ruled that it was not improper for an attorney to ghostwrite legal pleadings on behalf of a self-represented litigant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Rules that Incompetent Lawyering, but Not Legal Ghostwriting, Is Grounds for Sanctions|url=http://legalghostwriting.blogspot.com/2011/11/federal-court-rules-that-incompetent.html|work=LegalGhostwriting Blog|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Criticism==

[[Ethical]] concerns may arise for attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services to clients. A common criticism of legal ghostwriting is that it gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage because judges often grant ''pro se'' litigants leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. &lt;ref&gt; Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (“It is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.”)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that when clients employ an attorney ghostwriter, they should not be entitled to that privilege. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=2002|pages=1145, 1157–1158|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the [[New York State Bar Association]] requires attorneys to disclose their assistance in papers submitted to the court. Attorneys are not, however, required to disclose their name or firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unified Court System|first=New York State|title=Rule 1.2(c)|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/ForAttorneys/ProfessionalStandardsforAttorneys/NYRulesofProfessionalConduct4109.pdf|work=Rules of Professional Conduct|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other critics are concerned that when an attorney provides legal ghostwriting services to a client without disclosing his or her name, the attorney might be misleading the court, or seeking to avoid [[malpractice]] lawsuits or court rules against [[frivolous]] lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klempner|first=Rochelle|title=Unbundled Legal Services in Litigated Matters in New York State|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ip/partnersinjustice/Unbundled.pdf|work=A Proposal To Test the Efficacy through Law School Clinics|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the ABA in its 2007 opinion paper claimed that these ethical concerns were overstated. It concluded that:

"[b]ecause there is no reasonable concern that a litigant appearing ''pro se'' will receive an unfair benefit from a tribunal as a result of behind-the-scenes legal assistance, the nature or extent of such assistance is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Similarly, we do not believe that nondisclosure of the fact of legal assistance is dishonest so as to be prohibited by Rule 8.4(c). Whether it is dishonest for the lawyer to provide undisclosed assistance to a pro se litigant turns on whether the court would be misled by failure to disclose such assistance. The lawyer is making no statement at all to the forum regarding the nature or scope of the representation, and indeed, may be obliged under Rules 1.210 and 1.611 not to reveal the fact of the representation. Absent an affirmative statement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the documents were prepared without legal assistance, the lawyer has not been dishonest within the meaning of Rule 8.4(c). For the same reason, we reject the contention that a lawyer who does not appear in the action circumvents court rules requiring the assumption of responsibility for their pleadings. Such rules apply only if a lawyer signs the pleading and thereby makes an affirmative statement to the tribunal concerning the matter. Where a pro se litigant is assisted, no such duty is assumed. We conclude that there is no prohibition in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct against undisclosed assistance to pro se litigants, as long as the lawyer does not do so in a manner that violates rules that otherwise would apply to the lawyer’s conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal naturalism''' is a term coined by [[Olufemi Taiwo]] to describe a current in the social philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] which can be interpreted as one of [[Natural Law]]. Taiwo considered it the manifestation of Natural Law in a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] context.

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Megullia''', surnamed '''Dotata''' ('richly dowered'), was an ancient Roman noblewoman.

==Life==
Megullia is one of the one hundred and six subjects of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]’s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' (''De mulieribus claris'', 1362).&lt;ref name=GB&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio, Giovanni]], ''Famous Women'', translated by Virginia Brown (Cambridge and London, [[Harvard University Press]], 2001) pp. 109-110 ({{ISBN|0-674-01130-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; She is famous (as Boccaccio says) "more through the lavishness of her ancestors than through the worthiness of any of her own deeds. For at that time it seemed such a marvellous thing to give 50,000 bronze coins as dowry to one's husband..."&lt;ref name=guarino&gt;Boccaccio, Giovanni, ''Concerning Famous Women'', translated by Guido A. Guarino (New Brunswick, [[Rutgers University Press]], 1963) pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  Boccaccio used manuscripts of [[Valerius Maximus]] as his source, but they "disagree widely about the amount of money in Megullia's dowry".&lt;ref name=guarino/&gt; Valerius says in his Book 4 (4.10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html Valerius Maximus — Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] wrote to the Senate from Spain asking to be replaced. He wanted to go home to build up a dowry for his daughter that just became of marrying age.&lt;ref&gt;Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome By Valerius Maximus translated by Henry J. Walker, P. 141, {{ISBN|0-87220-674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate wanted Scipio to stay in command, so they consulted with the bride to be and Scipio's family and agreed on an amount that would be acceptable for a dowry of a daughter of a person of such high rank. They raised a dowry for Scipio's daughter from the treasury of 40,000 [[As (coin)|asses]]. [[Valerius Maximus|Valerius]] compares this sum of a family fortune to those raised for "Tuccia, daughter of [[Caeso Quinctius]]" (10,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') and for Megullia, daughter of a consul (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]]'') - from which the name "Dotata" (dowried) came when she entered her husband's house with this large amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5imDC6VN-FcC&amp;pg=PA141 translation of Valerius Maximus' Liber IV]&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to make then the name of the woman with such a large dowry that of '''''Megullia Dotata'''''. Besides Scipio and Fabricius, the Senate raised dowries for the daughters of others they wished to keep in service if there were no family funds for a dowry, like in the case of [[Fabricius Luscinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livy]], ''History of Rome'', Vol. 3 [10 AD], Book XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dotata==
At the beginning of the Roman republic [[dowry|dowries]] were small.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638349 Roman Dowry and the Devolution of Property in the Principate]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the dowry given by the senate to the daughter of [[Scipio Africanus]] was only 35 pounds or 11,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass.''&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Alexander; ''Roman antiquities: or An account of the manners and customs of the Romans'', p. 329; 1842 New York; New York public library 480576A&lt;/ref&gt; If the dowry was about five times this amount, 160 - 175 pounds (50,000 ''[[As (coin)|asses]] of brass''), then it was considered a Great Fortune and ''Megullia'' was nicknamed ''Dotata''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, ''op. cit.'', p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''dotata'' was synonymous with "dowry girl" and was the name given to the bride that had a [[dowry]]. This trend continued for a long time and if anything above a normal amount was given then the female giver was called a ''Megullia Dotata''.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

[[File:Getty Villa exterior.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Getty Villa]] representing life at otium (leisure) of an ancient Roman villa]] 
'''''Otium''''', a [[Latin]] abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's [[retirement]] after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing "active public life". ''Otium'' can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (''negotium'') or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (''i.e.'' speaking, writing, philosophy).

According to historian Carl Deroux in his work ''Studies in Latin literature and Roman history'', the word ''otium'' appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia.&lt;ref&gt;Deroux, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius' first use of the term ''otium'' around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed ''otium negotiosum'' (free time to do what one wanted) and ''otium otiosum'' (idle wasteless free time).&lt;ref name="Langis2"&gt;''[http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S&amp;R_2008_Langis.pdf Leisure, Idleness and Virtuous Activity in Shakespearean Drama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514084059/http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S%26R_2008_Langis.pdf# |date=14 May 2014 }}'' by Unhae Langis, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]], while discussing the word ''praeterpropter'' ("more or less") quotes a fragment of [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', which contrasts ''otium'' with ''negotium'' repeatedly.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0071:book=19:chapter=10 19, 10]. For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as "more or less" ''living''.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant appearance of the word in [[Latin literature]] occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the ''Iphigenia'' of [[Ennius]], where it is contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Ennius, frg. XCIX in the edition of Jocelyn, ''otio qui nescit uti | plus negoti habet quam cum est negotium in negotio'', rendered by Jocelyn: "the man who has no job to do and does not know how to employ the resulting leisure has more difficulty than when there is difficulty in a job on hand". For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of ''otium'' was never a direct translation of the Greek word "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. ''Otium'' is an example of the usage of the term "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war.&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"&gt;Sadlek, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (''i.e.'', winter months, weather not permitting war).&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"/&gt; This was associated with ''otium otiosum'' (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was ''otium negotiosum'' (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying [[hobby]] or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was ''otium privatum'' (private leisure), equal to ''negotium'' (a type of business).&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract "Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium" by Brian Vickers], p. 6 ''The first recorded use of the term is in a fragment from a soldiers' chorus in Ennius' Iphigenia (c. 190 BC), whose preservation we owe to that philologian's ragbag, the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (c. 150 AD) - he cites it as an example of the usage of the word praeterpropter (19.10.12). The soldiers are unoccupied, resting and bored, wanting to return home. They distinguish between otium negotiosum, leisure with a satisfying occupation, which takes place in the city, around the hearth, and otium otiosum, unoccupied and pointless leisure, such as their prolonged stay in the countryside, which they find disorientating. Andre argues that otium originally had military, not pastoral associations, referring to the enforced inactivity that coincided each year with the dead months of winter (especially January and February), unsuitable for war, farming or fishing.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest citation for ''otium'' is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17-24, The tragedy is [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', ''apud'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0071%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D10 19, 10] (a discussion of a different word in the same fragment).&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (''otium'') than to be idle doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons&lt;ref name="Bernard16"&gt;Bernard, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; - a time for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Even though originally ''otium'' was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons,&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"&gt;Bright, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, pp 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of ''otium'' as a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of ancient Roman considered ''otium'' a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paoli, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and [[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]] point out the only legitimate form of ''otium'' was transpired with intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Almasi, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otium'' was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (''negotium'') and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek philosophers ==
[[File:Epikur2.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]] ]]

The favorable sense of ''otium'' in [[Cicero]]nian Latin reflects the Greek term {{lang|grc|σχολή}} (''skholē'', "leisure", a meaning retained in [[Modern Greek]] as σχόλη, ''schólē''); "leisure" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the [[kalos kagathos|Athenian gentleman]]: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became "discussion", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. [[Plato]] (and his contemporaries, if the ''[[Greater Hippias]]'' be not authentic) brought ''schole'' into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the ''Greater Hippias'', it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henry Smith, ''The new nobility: A prolegomenon to Plato's "Greater Hippias"'' 2007; pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the [[Academy]], they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the [[New Academy]] of [[Carneades]] practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy lasted nearly a thousand years; different authors divide its history differently. For the text, see, ''inter permulta alia'', R. J. Hankinson, ''The Skeptics'', pp. 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] and [[Dicaearchus]], students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"/&gt;

Roman Epicureans used ''otium'' for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"&gt;Haase, p. 2265&lt;/ref&gt; An Epicurean proverb {{cquote|
''It is better to lie on the naked ground and be at ease, than to have a golden coach and a rich table and be worried.''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenmeyer, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The phrase "to be at ease" can have the meaning "to be of good cheer" or "to be without fear" {{mdash}} these being interdependent. The [[Epicurean]] idea of ''otium'' favors contemplation,&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (''i.e.'' sailors). The rustic ''otium'' concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism.  The active city public life of ''negotium'' and an ''otium'' of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].

[[Epicurus]]'s philosophy was contrary to [[Stoicism|Hellenistic Stoicism]]. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of ''otium''.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"/&gt; The concept of the Epicurean ''otium'' (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in [[Epicureanism|Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden]]. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in "The Garden" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean ''otium'' and the  Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of ''otium'' (''i.e.'' private or public; contemplation or "employment"; ''otium'' or ''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Republic ==
In early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, ''otium'' is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to ''officium'', "office, duty" than to ''negotium'' ('business"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then ''otium'' meant "leisure" while ''negotium'' meant "non-leisure" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of ''otium'' was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. ''Otium '' and ''negotium'' was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of ''otium'' was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter,&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 20-22,  35-36, 79-81, 421, 434-437&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the business (''negotium'') of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual ''otium.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows that the beauty of the individual ''otium'' poses rest.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 514 ''beaute de l'otium individuel poesie du repos.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Maccius Plautus]] in his play ''[[Mercator (play)|Mercator]]'' says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim ''tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames'' (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0102%3Aact%3D3%3Ascene%3D2 T. Maccius Plautus, Mercator (3.2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroEpistulaeAdFamiliaresVenice1547page329Detail.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Cicero busy at work]]

[[Cicero]] speaks of himself, with the expression ''otium cum dignitate'', that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Chaim |last1=Wirszubski |journal=The [[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=44|year=1954 |pages=1–13|title=Cicero's CVM Dignitate Otivm: A Reconsideration |jstor=637589 |doi=10.2307/297549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/637589 AUCTORITAS, DIGNITAS, OTIUM]&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ousted from  each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for "worthy leisure". During this time he composed ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', a series of books on [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"&gt;Stroup, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero defines ''otium'' as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of "public health".&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt; It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book ''On Duties'' that when the city life becomes [[Frustration|too much]], one should retreat to the country for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Prosperetti, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''otium cum dignitate'' in Cicero's ''Pro Sestio'' was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some.&lt;ref&gt;Wirszubski, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero says in ''Pro Sestio'', XLV., 98{{cquote|
''Id quod est praestantissimum, maximeque optabile omnibus sanis et bonis et beatis, cum dignitate otium.''&lt;br /&gt;That which stands first, and is most to be desired by all happy, honest and healthy-minded men, is ease with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Harbottle, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and ''otium''. In one passage of ''[[De Oratore]]'' he explains that [[Philistus]] spent his retirement writing history as his ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book ii. 13.57&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say in ''De Oratore'' Book iii that other men passed their ''otium'' of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, [[knucklebones]], dice games or just games they made up. Others that were "retired" from public life for whatever reason devoted their ''otium cum seritio'' (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book iii.15.57&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Klaus Bringmann]] shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a [[hypocrite]] while in ''otium''  because of his sense of duty to serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, pp. 77-78 ''Cicero on "otium"...   Bringmann presents a view of Cicero in which his unwavering sense of duty ...''

It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (''desidia'') had derogatory implications and unqualified ''otium'' was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with ''negotia publica'', participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''off.'' 3.1; ''Brut.'' 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish between plain "idleness" and aristocratic ''otium homestum'', ''otium liberale'' or ''otium cum dignitate'', writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to ''res publica'' (the general public).  These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc. 1.5; 5.105; ''fam'' 1.9.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Cat.'' 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero praises [[Cato the Elder]] for his respectful use of ''otium'' in  his expression ''non minus otii quam negotii'' (no less for doing nothing than business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x | volume=4 | title=Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium | year=1990 | journal=Renaissance Studies | pages=1–37 [7] | last1 = Vickers | first1 = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero was associating ''otium'' with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed he was ''never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.''&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Cicero in his ''[[De Officiis]]'' (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus ''Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a [[goad]].''  Cicero's idea of ''otium cum dignitate'' (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of "free time" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (''otium'') available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of [[hobby|hobbies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bereday, p. 60 &amp; 156&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero has a number of different concept versions for ''otium''. In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (''maximos labores'') should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Vasaly, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catullus]], a late [[Roman Republic]] poet, in his poems shows that the significance of ''otium'' of the middle Republican time of [[autonomy]] into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark ''otium'' with erotic influence.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt;

=== Imperial Rome ===
[[File:GNM - Römische Villa.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reconstruction of a Roman villa]]
The imperial dictatorship by [[Augustus]] during the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (''otium'') because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 123, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The home of choice (''domus'') then became the countryside [[villa]] as the rise of the [[Roman Empire]] made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-style architecture became their new [[Roman villa|villa otium]] outside of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/arts/12iht-otium.1.16069552.html?pagewanted=all |title=The pursuit of leisure and the rise of the Roman villa|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times the "otium villa " was a [[Dionysian]] idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (''otium'') in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The "villa with a garden" and "villa by the sea" was associated with ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
The life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a "superior world" of living.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Roman poet [[Statius]] writes of a "otium villa" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work ''[[Silvae]]'': ''It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure,  non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...''&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 3.5.85-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in ''otium'' of the time by the life he lived from his "otium villas". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |title=The Roman Villa |access-date=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620235350/http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |archive-date=20 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibullus]] was an [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac]] poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his [[Tibullus#Extant works|existing first two books of poetry]] he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]] as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, ''adsiduus labor'', and military service (''militia''). He shows in his poetry that originally ''otium'' was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons.&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"/&gt; Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (''interdum'') and therefore inserts ''otium'' (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life.&lt;ref name="Myers73"&gt;Myers, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ''ignobile otium'' (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee-Stecum, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of ''otium''. He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]] as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward ''otium''. The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that ''otium'' is not really "free time", but a study of other matters (''i.e.'', reading, writing) other than political and career gains.&lt;ref&gt;Trapp, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by ''otium liberale'' (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De otio, De brevitate vitae, De tranquillitate animi, ep.'' 82.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''epp.'' 1.22; 9.3&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of ''otium ruris'' (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''epod.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''g.'' 2.475–540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''dial.'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'' describes retirement from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Erskine, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on ''otium'' (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref name="Bernard16"/&gt;

These are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'':
# virtue, freedom and happiness by reasoning.
# the military metaphor.
# that the virtuous person chooses ''statio'', a specific place for doing one's 'employment'.
# ''otium'' (leisure) is still ''negotium'' (business) even if withdrawal from public activity.
# that the virtuous person's ''otium'', as a citizen of the universe, is the field for the performance of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later writers ===

[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|125px|&lt;center&gt;Augustine studying]]

While Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of [[Athenodorus of Soli|Athenodorus]]'s ''De Tranquillitate'' it is basically different. In ''De Otio 3.5'' Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in ''De Tranquillitate'' the theme is peace of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] reminded Romans of ''otium philosophandi'', a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that ''otium'' was the prerequisite for contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of ''otium'' that [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described ''Christianae vita otium'' as the Christian life of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of ''otium'' as the [[deadly sin]] of [[acedia]] (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated ''otium'' as meaning to serve God through deep thought.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary, ''Trin.'' 1.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; These same Christian writers also showed ''otium ruris'' (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic ''propositum''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulinus of Nola, ''ep.'' 5.4; ''carm.'' 10.166&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine describes the monastic life as ''otium sanctum'' (sanctified leisure or approved leisure).&lt;ref name="Enarrations"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/augustine/textstrans.html |title=Enarrations on the Psalms |page=220.3 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - ''negotium'') and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - ''otium'').&lt;ref name="Prosperetti 48"&gt;Prosperetti, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]], 14th-century poet and [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]], discusses ''otium'' in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees ''otium'' not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|100 px|left|&lt;center&gt;Petrarca]]

Petrarch considered solitude (''i.e.'', rural setting, "villa otium", [[Philippe de Cabassoles#The best friend of Petrarch|his Vaucluse home]]) and its relationship to ''otium'' as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said "no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it."&lt;ref&gt;Kleist, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of ''otium'':

{{cquote|''...&amp;nbsp;ought it not to be my first aim to have my leisure as remote from idleness as my life is from active affairs?''&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;}}
Petrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in ''otium'' (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's ''Vetus Itala'' in ''De otio religioso'' where in [[Christianity]] it was associated with contemplation and ''vacatio'' (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with ''videre'' (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of ''otium'' as ''vacate et videte'' (be still and see—a form of [[meditation]], contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Marvell]]’s seventeenth-century poem [[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]] is a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] of nine [[stanzas]] in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to ''otium''. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows ''otium'' to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized ''otium'' with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.&lt;ref name="Vickers5"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}; page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

What wondrous life is this I lead! &lt;br /&gt;
Ripe apples drop about my head; &lt;br /&gt;
The luscious clusters of the vine &lt;br /&gt;
Upon my mouth do crush their wine; &lt;br /&gt;
The nectarine and curious peach &lt;br /&gt;
Into my hands themselves do reach; &lt;br /&gt;
Stumbling on melons as I pass,&lt;br /&gt;
Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.

Meanwhile, mind, from pleasure less, &lt;br /&gt;
Withdraws into its happiness: &lt;br /&gt;
The mind, that ocean where each kind &lt;br /&gt;
Does straight its own resemblance find; &lt;br /&gt;
Yet it creates, transcending these, &lt;br /&gt;
Far other worlds, and other seas; &lt;br /&gt;
Annihilating all that's made &lt;br /&gt;
To a green thought in a green shade.

Here at the fountain's sliding foot, &lt;br /&gt;
Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root, &lt;br /&gt;
Casting the body's vest aside, &lt;br /&gt;
My soul into the boughs does glide: &lt;br /&gt;
There like a bird it sits and sings, &lt;br /&gt;
Then whets and combs its silver wings; &lt;br /&gt;
And, till prepared for longer flight, &lt;br /&gt;
Waves in its plumes the various light.

Such was that happy garden-state, &lt;br /&gt;
While man there walked without a mate: &lt;br /&gt;
After a place so pure and sweet, &lt;br /&gt;
What other help could yet be meet! &lt;br /&gt;
But 'twas beyond a mortal's share &lt;br /&gt;
To wander solitary there: &lt;br /&gt;
Two paradises 'twere in one &lt;br /&gt;
To live in Paradise alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/marvell/garden.htm The Garden by Andrew Marvell]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]], a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of ''otium'' in his 1878 publication ''[[Human, All Too Human|Menschliches, Allzumenschliches]]'':{{cquote|
Scholars are ashamed of ''otium.'' But there is something noble about leisure and idleness. {{mdash}} If idleness really is the beginning of all vice, then it is at any rate in the closest proximity to all virtue; the idle man is always a better man than the active. {{mdash}} But when I speak of leisure and idleness, you do not think I am alluding to you, do you, you sluggards?&lt;ref name="Vickers1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}; page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Nietzsche, ''Menschliches, Allzumenschliches.'' 1.284, 'Zu Gunsten der Müssigen', in Friedrich Nietzsche, Sämtliche Werke, ed.

Scholars are ashamed of otium. But there is one noble thing about idleness and idlers. If idleness is really the beginning of all vice, it finds itself, therefore, at least in near neighbourhood of all the virtues; the idle man is still a better man than the active. You do not suppose that in speaking of idleness and idlers I am alluding to you, you sluggards?''&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Private life and public life meanings ==
Private life meaning of ''otium'' meant personal [[retirement]]—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of "active public life". One would not be a historian in this case.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=637589 |title= Auctoritas, Dignitas, Otium |first1=J. P. V. D. |last1=Balsdon |authorlink= |doi= |publisher= Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=43–50 |date=May 1960 }}; page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In public life ''otium'' meant public peace and relief after war.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war).&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the ''[[status quo]]'': acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Sestio'' 98; cf. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">Neglect is defined as giving little attention to or to leave undone or unattended to, especially through carelessness. Mortuary neglect can comprise many things, such as bodies being stolen from the morgue, or bodies being mixed up and the wrong one was buried. When a mortuary fails to preserve a body correctly, it could also be considered neglect because of the consequences.

[[Insect indicators of abuse or neglect|Patient neglect]] is similar to mortuary neglect with one major difference: that patient neglect has to do with people who are still living and that neglect could ultimately lead to their death. Patient neglect concerns people in hospitals, in nursing homes, or being cared for in home. Usually in nursing homes or home-assisted living, neglect would consist of patients being left lying in their own urine and/or feces, which could, in turn, possibly attract flesh flies and lead to maggot infestation. It also encompasses patients getting rashes, [[lice]], and other sores from being improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldi, Kyle. "Noncompliance vs. Medical Neglect." ''American Orthopedic Journal'' 2007: 137-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of mortuary neglect and the law ==
The general sign of mortuary neglect (in terms of forensic entomology) is an infestation of maggots or some other insect (such as cockroaches) of a corpse. This should not be confused with insects found on a body before they are transferred to the morgue.  The following examples are forms of mortuary neglect that pertain to the ethical treatment of a corpse.

=== Improper embalming === 
Improper embalming is the utilization of embalming techniques that cause premature decomposition of the body especially in cases where the body in question is to be presented in an open-casket funeral. In addition, not refrigerating the body immediately following death, but before the embalming process could lead to rapid deterioration of the human remains as well.

==== Washington v. John T. Rhines Co. ====
On August 29, 1994, widow Marian Washington filed suit against funeral home, John T. Rhines Co., for improperly embalming her late husband Vernon W. Washington. She claimed that the embalming fluid was leaking and that her husband’s skin was decomposing at an alarming rate. John T. Rhines Co. re-embalmed Mr. Washington in efforts to make his body presentable. However, they failed to restore Mr. Washington’s body completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail37860/Page1.htm "Washington V. John T. Rhines Co."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cooley v. State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers ====
On May 3, 1956, Cooley, a petitioner of a particular funeral home tried to appeal the revoke of his license by the California state board of funeral directors and embalmers. The case reveals the reasons as to why the license was revoked. Cooley’s practices were described as unsanitary for the following reasons: an infant was discovered improperly embalmed after maggots were seeping out of its orifices, commingling of bodies, blood stains were found on the walls, and tools used were not cleaned from one autopsy to the next. Needless to say, the appeal was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooley V. State Bd. of Funeral Directors and Embalmers." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 293-296. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fencing stolen organs  ===
This form of abuse consists of selling body parts stolen from carcasses that are sent to the morgue for embalming.

=== Commingling of ashes ===
Commingling of ashes is putting several carcasses in the same crematorium during the same burn cycle. This act undermines the respect due a passed loved one.

=== Unauthorized disposal ===
In this form of abuse, funeral home operators dispose of the body in a manner not authorized by the deceased’s loved ones.

==== Christensen v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County ====
On June 28, 1990, a court heard a case on a class action suit against multiple funeral service operators. These acts included all of the types of mortuary neglect mentioned above in this section. The case contended that the defendants violated conscionable standards regarding the treatment of the deceased.  This practice occurred for nearly a decade and victimized approximately 17,000 decedents and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail38312/Page20.htm "Christensen V. Superior Court of Los Angeles County."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical treatment of the deceased ===
Any violation of the standards that any reasonable person would expect of a Mortuary operator could be considered in this category.

====Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home====
James Dennis, widower of Molly Dennis, sued Robbins Funeral Home on August 24, 1987. Before Mrs. Dennis was to be cremated, Lee Miller, the funeral director of Robbins Funeral Home called the family to see the body. When the family arrived, to their dismay, they found Molly Dennis’s body unprofessionally presented in an unhygienic environment as unspecified limbs were hanging off the dissection table and into a dirty sink. Mr. Dennis was not, however, able to successfully sue the funeral home because the judicial history in the area did not include a precedent for funeral home malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 698-701. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Funeral Directors Association==
The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) is an organization in the United States that regulates mortuaries and morgues and their activities regarding the [[embalming]] and interring of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php National Funeral Directors Association Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152454/http://nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php |date=2008-05-10 }} National Funeral Directors Association. 13 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  With any complaint including mortuary neglect, the NFDA has a fifteen step disciplinary process it goes through to determine the severity of the situation. After receiving a complaint, a committee reviews the situation even to the extent of an investigation and then they determine the consequences of the violation. Those considered in violation of the NFDA’s policies could face punitive action ranging from a warning to suspension from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/files/2003FaxBackPDFs/Membership/9506_CodeofProfessionalConductEnforcement.pdf NFDA Code of Professional Conduct.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Funeral Directors Association. National Funeral Directors Association. 13 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
There are certain segments of the health care industry that are seeing downward moves in neglect, while other sections are experiencing unfortunate growth.  In modern hospitals the most prevalent form of neglect deals with the patients themselves neglecting their own care.  However, in other segments such as assisted living for mentally deficient patients the rates of abuse and neglect are still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Graham. "Patients at Risk of Neglect in Mental Health Trusts" ''Nursing Standard'' 7 Jan. 2004: 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortuary neglect is another segment that has peculiar trends. There are relatively few morticians that just refuse to perform their duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. Morticians only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families are just a few examples of reported cases of neglect.

Increasingly medical journals are recommending that doctors become more active in attempting to persuade parents and guardians of children to either accept or continue treatment for diseases or injuries in order to avoid a neglect case.  In the American Orthopedic Journal a case study was presented where a doctor suggested that an effort to convince a girl's mother to adequately treat a case of [[ambylopia]] to avoid potential neglect.  While a viewpoint arguing this was unnecessary, it shows a growing trend to go beyond traditional measures to avoid neglect charges.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, Jane N. "Avoiding Charges of Fraud and Abuse: Developing and Implementing an Effective Compliance Program." ''Journal of Nursing Administration'' Dec. 2004: 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From the times of the ancient [[Egyptians]], cases of mortuary neglect have been recorded. The process of [[embalming]] is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was just as important as life itself. However, if a woman was married to an embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious [[decomposition]] took place.

Dignity for the dead is now a [[legal]] matter, as patient neglect has always been. Abuse in the healthcare system is another huge problem in today’s society. Nursing homes and hospitals are preying grounds for predators of the weak and disabled. In 2001 a nursing home in Ossining, New York was closed because of neglect and unsafe conditions that existed for the patients.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Katherine. "Nursing Home Shuts Down After U.S. Finding of Danger." ''New York Times'' [New York City] 23 August 2001: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US state laws==
For the most part, mortuary standards are created by the states, not by the federal government. The following are links to state policies (where available) on mortuary practices:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9367">{{Sociology}}
'''Political sociology''' is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State, to civil society, to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the "founding fathers" of sociology – Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber – to such contemporary theorists as Gellner, Giddens, Habermas and Mann. 
Where a typical research question in political [[sociology]] might have been "Why do so few American or European citizens choose to [[Voting|vote]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way | publisher=Pantheon | author=Piven, F. | year=1988 | isbn=0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even "What difference does it make if women get elected?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Phillips |date=1991|title= Engendering Democracy | location= Cambridge| publisher=Polity | URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7EUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; political sociologists also now ask: "How is the body a site of power?",&lt;ref&gt;R. Sassatelli (2011) 'Body Politics' in E. Amenta, K. Nash and A. Scott (eds) The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; "How are emotions relevant to global [[poverty]]?",&lt;ref&gt;K. Nash (2008) 'Global citizenship as show business: the cultural politics of Make Poverty History' Media, Culture and Society 30/1 &lt;http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/94/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "What difference does knowledge make to [[democracy]]?"&lt;ref&gt;B. De Sousa Santos et al. (2007) Another Knowledge Is Possible: Beyond Northern Epistemologies (Reinventing Social Emancipation: Toward New Manifestos), London: Verso &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=2yO5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=another+knowledge+is+possible&amp;dq=another+knowledge+is+possible&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mJqETo-IE8iV8QO60PE-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional divisions ==
Traditionally there were four main areas of research:

# The sociopolitical formation of the [[modern state]];
# "Who rules?" How [[social inequality]] between [[Social group|groups]] ([[Social class|class]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], etc.) influences [[politics]];&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff G. William. Power Structure Research and the hope for Democracy. Adam Schneider, April 2005. Web Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009. From: &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=three+major+theoretical+frameworks+are+elite+pluralism+and+managerial+theory.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# How [[public opinion]], [[ideology|ideologies]], personalities, [[social movement]]s, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics;
# Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell,Timothy, Betty A. Dobratz,and Lisa K. Waldner."The Politics of Social Inequality." 14 Mar. 2001. Web. 29 Sept 2009. From: &lt;http://books.emeraldinsight.com/display.asp?K=9780762307562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nachtigal M. Paul."Political Trends Affecting Nonmetropolitan America." Journal of Research in Rural Education Vol.10 (1994):161–166. Print. From: &lt;http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v10,n3,p161-166,Nachtigal.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], elite or managerial theory, and class analysis (which overlaps with [[Marxism|Marxist]] analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Peter, Arnold Rose, [[Talcott Parsons]], and Neil Smelser. "Political Sociological Theories:Theories of the State and Power." 16 Jan. 2003. Web. 28 Sept 2009 from: &lt;{{cite web |url=http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212105955/http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |archivedate=2009-12-12 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is [[Theda Skocpol]]. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis A. Coser]]. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48–50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=social+class+theory+emerged+when&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can be split into two parts: one is the "power structure" or "instrumentalist" approach, whereas another is the [[Structural functionalism|structuralist]] approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is [[G. William Domhoff]]. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others ([[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Bob Jessop]]).

== Pluralism and power relations ==
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of [[social theory]]. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies ([[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]), post-structuralism ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]]), pragmatism ([[Luc Boltanski]]), structuration theory ([[Anthony Giddens]]), and cultural sociology ([[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]).

Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal [[economic power]] and thus possible political inequality as well.

For pluralists,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.

The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz&lt;ref&gt;Bachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non-decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57&lt;/ref&gt; (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''The Project on Scientific Knowledge and Public Policy (SKAPP)''', based at the [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], examines the nature of science and the ways in which it is both used and misused in government decision-making and legal proceedings. Through [[empirical research]], conversations among scholars, and publications, SKAPP aims to enhance understanding of how knowledge is generated and interpreted. SKAPP's mission is to promote transparent decision-making based on the best available science in order to promote public safety and health.

SKAPP provides information about the impacts of existing legislation and regulation on drug safety, [[occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]], and [[environmental health]]. It has examined the use of science in regulation of specific hazards, including [[bisphenol A]], [[beryllium]], [[hexavalent chromium]], and the butter-flavoring chemical [[diacetyl]].

Support for SKAPP is provided by the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services, the [[Open Society Institute]], and the Rockefeller Family Fund. Past support has been provided by the Common Benefit Trust, a fund established pursuant to a court order in the Silicone Gel Breast Implant Products Liability litigation; the Alice Hamilton Fund; and the [[Bauman Foundation]].

== Scientific evidence and the law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of the [[United States]] has issued three rulings which greatly impact the role scientists may play in providing [[expert testimony]]. These rulings are ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]],'' ''General Electric v. Joiner'', and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]].'' Each address the "[[gatekeeper]]" role of the judge in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, with considerable implications for [[tort]] litigation.

{{Other uses}}

'''Regulation''' is an abstract concept of management of [[complex systems]] according to a set of rules and trends. In [[systems theory]], these types of rules exist in various fields of [[biology]] and [[society]], but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. For example:
* in biology, [[gene regulation]] and [[metabolic regulation]] allow living organisms to adapt to their environment and maintain [[homeostasis]];
* in [[government]], typically regulation means stipulations of the [[delegated legislation]] which is drafted by [[subject-matter expert]]s to enforce a [[statutory instrument]] ([[primary legislation]]);
* in business,  [[industry self-regulation]] occurs through [[self-regulatory organization]]s and [[trade association]]s which allow industries to set and enforce rules with less government involvement; and,
* in psychology, [[self-regulation theory]] is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals.

== Social ==

Regulation in the social, political, and economic domains can take many forms: [[law|legal]] restrictions promulgated by a [[government]] authority, contractual obligations (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt;), [[social control|social regulation]] (e.g. [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s), co-regulation, third-party regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Faur, David, Regulation and Regulatory Governance, Jerusalem Papers in Regulation and Governance, No.1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State (polity)|State]]-mandated regulation is government intervention in the private market in an attempt to implement [[policy]] and produce outcomes which might not otherwise occur,&lt;ref name="Orbach"&gt;Orbach, Barak, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2143385 What Is Regulation? 30 Yale Journal on Regulation Online] 1 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from consumer protection to faster growth or technological advancement. The regulations may prescribe or proscribe conduct ("command-and-control" regulation), calibrate incentives ("incentive" regulation), or change preferences ("preferences shaping" regulation). Common examples of regulation include controls on market entries, [[price]]s, [[wage]]s, [[development approvals]], [[pollution]] effects, [[employment]] for certain people in certain [[Industry|industries]], standards of production for certain [[good (economics)|good]]s, the military forces and [[Tertiary sector of industry|services]]. The [[economics]] of imposing or removing regulations relating to [[market (economics)|market]]s is analysed in [[regulatory economics]].

Power to regulate should include the power to enforce regulatory decisions. Monitoring is an important tool used by national regulatory authorities in carrying out the regulated activities.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac. Monitoringgrundlagen der kroatischen Regulierungsbehörde für Energie. EW − das Magazin für die Energie Wirtschaft, Vol. 103, No. 1-2, 2004, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries (in particular the Scandinavian countries) industrial relations are to a very high degree regulated by the labour market parties themselves (self-regulation) in contrast to state regulation of minimum wages etc.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2017) [http://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/23904978/Kjellberg_FSNumhauserHenning_Self_Regulation_State_Regulation.pdf ”Self-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations”] In Mia Rönnmar and Jenny Julén Votinius (eds.) ''Festskrift till Ann Numhauser-Henning''. Lund: Juristförlaget i Lund 2017, pp. 357-383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===

{{weasel|date=March 2018}}
Regulations may create costs as well as benefits and may produce unintended reactivity effects, such as defensive practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael Daniel |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient regulations can be defined as those where total benefits exceed total costs.

Regulations can be advocated for a variety of reasons, including:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*[[Market failure]]s - regulation due to inefficiency. Intervention due to what economists call [[market failure]].
**To constrain sellers' options in markets characterized by [[monopoly]]
**As a means to implement collective action, in order to provide [[public good]]s
**To assure adequate [[information]] in the market
**To mitigate undesirable [[externality|externalities]]
*Collective desires - regulation about collective desires or considered judgments on the part of a significant segment of [[society]]{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*Diverse experiences - regulation with a view of [[censorship|eliminating]] or [[sensitivity training|enhancing]] opportunities for the formation of diverse preferences and beliefs{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*Social subordination - regulation aimed to increase or reduce social subordination of various social groups{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
*[[Endogenous]] preferences - regulation intended to affect the development of certain preferences on an aggregate level{{vague|date=February 2013}}
*[[Professional conduct]] - the regulation of members of [[professional bodies]], either acting under [[statutory power|statutory]] or [[contractual powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris |first= Brian |author2=Andrew Carnes |title= Disciplinary and Regulatory Proceedings |publisher= Jordans |date=February 2011 |isbn= 978-1-84661-270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Interest group]] transfers - regulation that results from efforts by self-interest groups to redistribute wealth in their favor, which may be disguised as one or more of the justifications above.
The study of formal (legal or official) and informal (extra-legal or unofficial) regulation constitutes one of the central concerns of the [[sociology of law]].

=== History ===

Regulation of businesses existed in the [[ancient history|ancient]] early Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. Standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world, and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency. In China, a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented. Sophisticated law existed in [[Ancient Rome]]. In the European [[Early Middle Ages]], law and standardization declined with the Roman Empire, but regulation existed in the form of norms, customs, and privileges; this regulation was aided by the unified Christian identity and a sense of honor in regard to [[contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Braithwaite, Péter Drahos. (2000). ''Global Business Regulation''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Beginning in the late 19th and 20th century, much of regulation in the United States was administered and enforced by [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] which produced their own [[administrative law]] and procedures under the authority of statutes. Legislators created these agencies to allow experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue. At the federal level, one of the earliest institutions was the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies. Later agencies include the [[Federal Trade Commission]], [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Civil Aeronautics Board]], and various other institutions. These institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level. Individual agencies do not necessarily have clear [[Enterprise life cycle|life-cycles]] or patterns of behavior, and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the [[organic law]] creating the agency. In the 1930s, lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency; in the 1960s and 1970s, concern shifted to [[regulatory capture]], which led to extremely detailed laws creating the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].

{{Nanotechnology}}

Because of the ongoing controversy on the [[implications of nanotechnology]], there is significant debate concerning whether [[nanotechnology]] or nanotechnology-based [[List of nanotechnology applications|products]] merit special government [[regulation]]. This mainly relates to when to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment.

[[Nanotechnology]] refers to an increasing number of commercially available products – from socks and trousers to tennis racquets and cleaning cloths. Such nanotechnologies and their accompanying industries have triggered calls for increased community participation and effective regulatory arrangements.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz E, Lovel R, Mee W, Solomon F |title=Social perspectives on nanotechnology research and development: a view from Australia |publisher= Participatory approaches in science and Technology, Edinburgh Scotland |year=2006 |url=http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/PATHconference/PATHconference_proceeding_ps7.html#session7.2.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these calls have presently not led to such comprehensive [[regulation]] to oversee research and the commercial application of nanotechnologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchant G, Sylvester D | title=Transnational Models for Regulation of Nanotechnology |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics| volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=714–725 |year=2006 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2006.00091.x |pmid=17199813}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any comprehensive labeling for products that contain [[nanoparticles]] or are derived from nano-processes.

Regulatory bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] in the U.S. or the [[Health and Consumer Protection Directorate]] of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling.

==Managing risks: human and environmental health and safety==
{{further|Implications of nanotechnology|Nanotoxicology}}

Studies of the health impact of airborne particles generally shown that for toxic materials, smaller particles are more toxic. This is due in part to the fact that, given the same mass per volume, the dose in terms of particle numbers increases as particle size decreases.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Based upon available data, it has been argued that current risk assessment methodologies are not suited to the hazards associated with nanoparticles; in particular, existing [[toxicological]] and eco-toxicological methods are not up to the task; exposure evaluation (dose) needs to be expressed as quantity of nanoparticles and/or surface area rather than simply mass; equipment for routine detecting and measuring nanoparticles in air, water, or soil is inadequate; and very little is known about the physiological responses to nanoparticles.

Regulatory bodies in the U.S. as well as in the EU have concluded that nanoparticles form the potential for an entirely new risk and that it is necessary to carry out an extensive analysis of the risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The challenge for regulators is whether a matrix can be developed which would identify nanoparticles and more complex nanoformulations which are likely to have special toxicological properties or whether it is more reasonable for each particle or formulation to be tested separately.

The [[ICON: The International Council on Nanotechnology|International Council on Nanotechnology]] maintains a database and Virtual Journal of scientific papers on environmental, health and safety research on nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icon.rice.edu/virtualjournal.cfm/ Virtual Journal of Nanotechnology Environment, Health and Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318020035/http://www.icon.rice.edu/virtualjournal.cfm |date=2010-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently has over 2000 entries indexed by particle type, exposure pathway and other criteria. The [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] (PEN) currently lists 807 products that manufacturers have voluntarily identified that use nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/index.php?id=44&amp;action=intro|title=Nanotechnology - Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No labeling is required by the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/43305/story.htm

|first = Kim |date = 2007-07-21|work = Reuters News Service|publisher = Planet Ark}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that number could be significantly higher. "The use of nanotechnology in consumer products and industrial applications is growing rapidly, with the products listed in the PEN inventory showing just the tip of the iceberg" according to PEN Project Director David Rejeski [http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/6697/]. A list of those products that have been voluntarily disclosed by their manufacturers is located here [http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/browse/products/].

The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] that must be issued for certain materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only.

==Democratic governance==
Many{{who|date=January 2012}} argue that government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for the public to be involved in the development of new forms of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Democratic Technologies? Final Report of the Nanotechnology Engagement Group |url=http://www.involve.org.uk/negreport }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community engagement can be achieved through various means or mechanisms. An online journal article&lt;ref name="PublicUnderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowe G, Horlick-Jones T, Walls J, Pidgeon N |title=Difficulties in evaluating public engagement initiatives: reflections on an evaluation of the UK GM Nation? |journal=Public Understanding of Science |volume=14 |pages=331–352 |url=http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107033014/http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/331 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-07 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0963662505056611 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies traditional approaches such as referenda, consultation documents, and advisory committees that include community members and other stakeholders. Other conventional approaches include public meetings and "closed" dialog with stakeholders. More contemporary engagement processes that have been employed to include community members in decisions about nanotechnology include citizens' juries and consensus conferences. Leach and Scoones (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;45)&lt;ref name="Demos"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Melissa Leach |author2=Ian Scoones |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Slow Race: Making Technology Work for the Poor |publisher=Demos |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theslowrace |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112225426/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theslowrace |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that since that “most debates about science and technology options involve uncertainty, and often ignorance, public debate about regulatory regimes is essential.”

It has been argued{{by whom|date=January 2012}} that limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman D, Hodge G |title=A Small Matter of Regulation: An International Review of Nanotechnology Regulation |journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review |volume=8 |pages=1–32 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

Community education, engagement and consultation tend to occur "downstream": once there is at least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. "Upstream" engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: "dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, technology foresight and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs."&lt;ref name="Demos" /&gt; Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University’s Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that "by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brainard J. |title=A More Social Science |url=http://cspo.org/home/newatcspo/sarewitz_chronicle.htm |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706130122/http://www.cspo.org/home/newatcspo/sarewitz_chronicle.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is "meant to create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on carefull assessment of objective information".&lt;ref name="Stimulating Upstream Engagement 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xenos|first1=Michael|last2=Becker|first2=Amy|last3=Anderson|first3=Ashley|last4=Brossard|first4=Dominique|last5=Scheufele|first5=Dietram|title=Stimulating Upstream Engagement: An Experimental Study of Nanotechnology Information Seeking|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=December 2011|volume=92|issue=5|pages=1192–1214|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information ("anticipatory elaboration"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials.&lt;ref name="Stimulating Upstream Engagement 2011"/&gt;

The stance that the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of nanotechnology should be subject to control by the [[public sector]] is sometimes referred to as [[nanosocialism]].

===Newness===
The question of whether nanotechnology represents something 'new' must be answered to decide how best nanotechnology should be regulated.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; The Royal Society&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |year=2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that the UK government assess chemicals in the form of nanoparticles or nanotubes as new substances. Subsequent to this, in 2007 a coalition of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100831042620/http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 over forty groups] called for nanomaterials to be classified as new substances, and regulated as such.

Despite these recommendations, chemicals comprising nanoparticles that have previously been subject to assessment and regulation may be exempt from regulation, regardless of the potential for different risks and impacts. In contrast, nanomaterials are often recognized as 'new' from the perspective of [[intellectual property rights]] (IPRs), and as such are commercially protected via patenting laws.

There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auplat|first=Claire|title=The Challenges of nanotechnology policy making - Part 1|journal=Global Policy|year=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=492–500|doi=10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00159.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00159.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auplat|first=Claire|title=The challenges of nanotechnology policy making - Part 2|journal=Global Policy|year=2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=101–107|doi=10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00160.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00160.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively "slip through the cracks" without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of [[titanium dioxide]] (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and [[zinc oxide]] (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage ''in vitro'', such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the [[stratum corneum]] of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the [[precautionary principle]] in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Nasu H, Murray K, Bowman D. Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in SunscreensNanoethics (2008) 2:231–240 DOI 10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed prepainted steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen.&lt;ref&gt;Barker PJ and Branch A. The interaction of modern sunscreen formulations with surface coatings. Progress in Organic Coatings 2008; 62: 313-320&lt;/ref&gt; Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.

Nanomedicines are just beginning to enter drug regulatory processes, but within a few decades could comprise a dominant group within the class of innovative [[pharmaceuticals]], the current thinking of government safety and [[cost-effectiveness]] regulators appearing to be that these products give rise to few if any nano-specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T and Faunce TA Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs Journal of Law and Medicine 2007; 16: 822-845&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics (such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]]) have challenged that proposition and suggest that nanomedicines may create unique or heightened policy challenges for government systems of cost-effectiveness as well as safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Policy challenges of nanomedicine for Australia’s PBS. Australian Health Review 2009; 33 (2): 258-267&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant [[public good]] aspects to the regulation of nanotechnology, particularly with regard to ensuring that industry involvement in standard-setting does not become a means of reducing competition and that nanotechnology policy and regulation encourages new models of safe drug discovery and development more systematically targeted at the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Toxicological and public good considerations for the regulation of nanomaterial-containing
medical products. Expert Opinion in Drug Safety (2008) 7(2):103-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, White JW, Matthaei KI. Integrated Research into the Nanoparticle-protein Corona: A New Focus for Safe, Sustainable and Equitable Development of Nanomedicines Nanomedicine 2008;(6): 859-66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industry self-regulation|Self-regulation]] attempts may well fail, due to the inherent [[conflict of interest]] in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization.
The Food and Drug Administration notes that it only regulates on the basis of voluntary claims made by the product manufacturer. If no claims are made by a manufacturer, then the FDA may be unaware of nanotechnology being employed.&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

Yet regulations worldwide still fail to distinguish between materials in their nanoscale and bulk form. This means that nanomaterials remain effectively unregulated; there is no regulatory requirement for nanomaterials to face new health and safety testing or environmental impact assessment prior to their use in commercial products, if these materials have already been approved in bulk form. The health risks of nanomaterials are of particular concern for workers who may face [[Occupational safety and health|occupational exposure]] to nanomaterials at higher levels, and on a more routine basis, than the general public.

=== International law===

There is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite journal |title= FDA and Nanotechnology Products: Frequently asked questions |publisher= Food and Drug Administration |url= http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/FrequentlyAskedQuestions/ |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor are there any internationally agreed definitions or terminology for nanotechnology, no internationally agreed protocols for toxicity testing of nanoparticles, and no standardized protocols for evaluating the environmental impacts of nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Standardisation for Nanotechnologies |publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards |url=http://www.ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706163117/http://ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since products that are produced using nanotechnologies will likely enter international trade, it is argued that it will be necessary to harmonize nanotechnology standards across national borders. There is concern that some countries, most notably developing countries, will be excluded from international standards negotiations. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20080706163117/http://ifas.msu.edu/keyprojects.htm Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards] notes that “developing countries should have a say in international nanotechnology standards development, even if they lack capacity to enforce the standards". (p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;{{cite journal |title= An Issues Landscape for Nanotechnology Standards. Report of a Workshop | publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards, Michigan State University, East Lansing |year=2007}} {{cite web |url=http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171215/http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about monopolies and concentrated control and ownership of new nanotechnologies were raised in community workshops in Australia in 2004.&lt;ref name="Australia" /&gt;

==Arguments against regulation==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Wide use of the term nanotechnology in recent years has created the impression that regulatory frameworks are suddenly having to contend with entirely new challenges that they are unequipped to deal with.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Many regulatory systems around the world already assess new substances or products for safety on a case by case basis, before they are permitted on the market. These regulatory systems have been assessing the safety of nanometre scale molecular arrangements for many years and many substances comprising nanometre scale particles have been in use for decades e.g. [[Carbon black]], [[Titanium dioxide]], [[Zinc oxide]], [[Bentonite]], [[Aluminum silicate]], [[Iron oxide]]s, [[Silicon dioxide]], [[Diatomaceous earth]], [[Kaolin]], [[Talc]], [[Montmorillonite]], [[Magnesium oxide]], [[Copper sulphate]].

These existing approval frameworks almost universally use the best available science to assess safety and do not approve substances or products with an unacceptable risk benefit profile. One proposal is to simply treat particle size as one of the several parameters defining a substance to be approved, rather than creating special rules for all particles of a given size regardless of type. A major argument against special regulation of nanotechnology is that the [[List of nanotechnology applications|projected applications]] with the greatest impact are [[Future studies|far in the future]], and it is unclear how to regulate technologies whose feasibility is speculative at this point. In the meantime, it has been argued that the immediate applications of [[nanomaterials]] raise challenges not much different from those of introducing any other new material, and can be dealt with by minor tweaks to existing regulatory schemes rather than sweeping regulation of entire scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Rollins, Nanobiotechnology Regulation: A Proposal for Self-Regulation with Limited Oversight, 6 NANOTECHNOLOGY L. &amp; BUS. 221, 221 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

A truly precautionary approach to regulation could severely impede development in the field of nanotechnology safety studies are required for each and every nanoscience application. While the outcome of these studies can form the basis for government and international regulations, a more reasonable approach might be development of a [[risk matrix]] that identifies likely culprits.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Response from governments ==
=== United Kingdom ===

In its seminal 2004 report ''Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties'', the United Kingdom's Royal Society concluded that:

:''Many nanotechnologies pose no new risks to health and almost all the concerns relate to the potential impacts of deliberately manufactured nanoparticles and nanotubes that are free rather than fixed to or within a material... We expect the likelihood of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released from products in which they have been fixed or embedded (such as composites) to be low but have recommended that manufacturers assess this potential exposure risk for the lifecycle of the product and make their findings available to the relevant regulatory bodies... It is very unlikely that new manufactured nanoparticles could be introduced into humans in doses sufficient to cause the health effects that have been associated with [normal air pollution].''

but have recommended that nanomaterials be regulated as new chemicals, that research laboratories and factories treat nanomaterials "as if they were [[Hazardous material|hazardous]]", that release of nanomaterials into the environment be avoided as far as possible, and that products containing nanomaterials be subject to new safety testing requirements prior to their commercial release.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

The 2004 report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; noted that existing UK regulations did not require additional testing when existing substances were produced in nanoparticulate form. The Royal Society recommended that such regulations were revised so that “chemicals produced in the form of nanoparticles and nanotubes be treated as new chemicals under these regulatory frameworks” (p.xi). They also recommended that existing regulation be modified on a precautionary basis because they expect that “the toxicity of chemicals in the form of free nanoparticles and nanotubes cannot be predicted from their toxicity in a larger form and... in some cases they will be more toxic than the same mass of the same chemical in larger form.”&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;

The [[Better Regulation Commission]]'s earlier 2003 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientific Research: Innovation with Controls |publisher= Better Regulation Task Force |url=http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/brc/upload/assets/www.brc.gov.uk/scientificresearch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; had recommended that the UK Government:
# enable, through an informed debate, the public to consider the risks for themselves, and help them to make their own decisions by providing suitable information;
# be open about how it makes decisions, and acknowledge where there are uncertainties;
# communicate with, and involve as far as possible, the public in the decision making process;
# ensure it develops two-way communication channels; and
# take a strong lead over the handling of any risk issues, particularly information provision and policy implementation.

These recommendations were accepted in principle by the UK Government. Noting that there was “no obvious focus for an informed public debate of the type suggested by the Task Force”, the UK government's [http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/brc/upload/assets/www.brc.gov.uk/scienceresponse.pdf response] was to accept the recommendations.

The Royal Society's 2004 report&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; identified two distinct governance issues:
# the “role and behaviour of institutions” and their ability to “minimise unintended consequences” through adequate regulation and
# the extent to which the public can trust and play a role in determining the trajectories that nanotechnologies may follow as they develop.

=== United States ===

Rather than adopt a new nano-specific regulatory framework, the United States' [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) convenes an 'interest group' each quarter with representatives of FDA centers that have responsibility for assessment and regulation of different substances and products. This interest group ensures coordination and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Task Force Report |publisher= FDA Nanotechnology Task Force |url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/NanotechnologyTaskForceReport2007/default.htm |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2009 FDA document called for identifying sources of nanomaterials, how they move in the environment, the problems they might cause for people, animals and plants, and how these problems could be avoided or mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Small concerns: nanotech regulations and risk management |publisher= SPIE Newsroom |url=http://spie.org/x38158.xml |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/upload/AB_289_Bill_Language.pdf|title=Assembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) within the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] and other agencies to request information on environmental and health impacts from chemical manufacturers and importers, including testing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical Information Call-In web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the [http://www.calepa.ca.gov/ California Environmental Protection Agency], announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanotechnology web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical Information Call-In web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sections were added as a result of the adoption of [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/pollutionprevention/chemical_call_in.cfm Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006)]. They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.

On January 22, 2009, a [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Formal_AB289_Call_In_Letter_CNTs.pdf formal information request letter] was sent to [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/AB289_CNT_Contact_List.pdf manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State]. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.

The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Archived DTSC Nanotechnology Symposia |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/ArchivedSymposium.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm.

On December 21, 2010, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) initiated the second Chemical Information Call-in for six nanomaterials: nano cerium oxide, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide, nano zero valent iron, nano zinc oxide, and quantum dots. DTSC sent a formal information request letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Round_Two_Call-in_Letter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; to forty manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Round_Two_List_of_Letters_Sent.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; who produce or import the six nanomaterials in California, or who may export them into the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanotechnology web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/nanometalcallin.cfm|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chemical Information Call-in is meant to identify information gaps of these six nanomaterials and to develop further knowledge of their analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information under California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. DTSC completed the carbon nanotube information call-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/CNTcallin.cfm|title=CommonSpot Error|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2010.

DTSC partners with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Riverside (UCR), University of Southern California (USC), Stanford University, Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEIN), and The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on safe nanomaterial handling practices.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

DTSC is interested in expanding the Chemical Information Call-in to members of the bominated flame retardants, members of the methyl siloxanes, ocean plastics, nano-clay, and other emerging chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|title=Chemical Information Call-in Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

The European Union has formed a group to study the implications of nanotechnology called the [[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/about-nanotechnologies.htm#7|title=The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/index.htm#1|title=Public Health - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has published a list of risks associated with nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/l-2/6-health-effects-nanoparticles.htm#0 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306014519/http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/l-2/6-health-effects-nanoparticles.htm |date=2008-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, manufacturers and importers of carbon products, including carbon nano-tubes will have to submit full health and safety data within a year or so in order to comply with [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/pre-registration_en.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508014507/http://echa.europa.eu/pre-registration_en.asp |archivedate=2009-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European member states have called for the creation of either national or European nanomaterials registries. France, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have established national registries of nanomaterials. In Addition, the European Commission requested the [[European Chemicals Agency|Europeach Chemicals Agency (ECHA)]] to create a [https://euon.echa.europa.eu/ European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)] that aims at collecting publically available information on the safety and markets of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. 

== Response from advocacy groups ==

In January 2008, a coalition of over 40 civil society groups endorsed a statement of principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano-materials |publisher=International Center for Technology Assessment |year=2008 |url=http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831042620/http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for precautionary action related to nanotechnology. The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]]'s report ''Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano materials'',&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Broab international coalition issues urgent call for strong oversight of nanotechnology| publisher = International Center for Technology Assessment| date = 2007-07-31| url = http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| accessdate = 2007-10-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065131/http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| archivedate = 2007-11-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states:

:''Hundreds of consumer products incorporating nano-materials are now on the market, including cosmetics, sunscreens, sporting goods, clothing, electronics, baby and infant products, and food and food packaging. But evidence indicates that current nano-materials may pose significant health, safety, and environmental hazards. In addition, the profound social, economic, and ethical challenges posed by nano-scale technologies have yet to be addressed ... 'Since there is currently no government oversight and no labeling requirements for nano-products anywhere in the world, no one knows when they are exposed to potential nano-tech risks and no one is monitoring for potential health or environmental harm. That's why we believe oversight action based on our principles is urgent' ... This industrial boom is creating a growing nano-workforce which is predicted to reach two million globally by 2015. 'Even though potential health hazards stemming from exposure have been clearly identified, there are no mandatory workplace measures that require exposures to be assessed, workers to be trained, or control measures to be implemented,' explained Bill Kojola of the AFL-CIO. 'This technology should not be rushed to market until these failings are corrected and workers assured of their safety'"''&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"/&gt; also [https://web.archive.org/web/20100317234824/http://icta.org/nanotech/index.cfm].

The group has urged action based on eight principles. They are (1) A Precautionary Foundation (2) Mandatory Nano-specific Regulations (3) Health and Safety of the Public and Workers (4) Environmental Protection (5) Transparency (6) Public Participation (7) Inclusion of Broader Impacts and (8) Manufacturer Liability.

Some NGOs, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20100303043550/http://www.foe.org.au/nano-tech Friends of the Earth], are calling for the formation of a separate nanotechnology specific regulatory framework for the regulation of nanotechnology. In Australia, Friends of the Earth propose the establishment of a Nanotechnology Regulatory Coordination Agency, overseen by a Foresight and Technology Assessment Board. The advantage of this arrangement is that it could ensure a centralized body of experts that are able to provide oversight across the range of nano-products and sectors. It is also argued&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; that a centralized regulatory approach would simplify the regulatory environment, thereby supporting industry innovation. A National Nanotechnology Regulator could coordinate existing regulations related to nanotechnology (including intellectual property, civil liberties, product safety, occupation health and safety, environmental and international law). Regulatory mechanisms could vary from "hard law at one extreme through licensing and codes of practice to 'soft' self-regulation and negotiation in order to influence behavior."&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt; 
The formation of national nanotechnology regulatory bodies may also assist in establishing global regulatory frameworks.&lt;ref name="Futures"/&gt;

In early 2008, The UK's largest organic certifier, [http://www.soilassociation.org/ the Soil Association], announced that its organic standard would exclude nanotechnology, recognizing the associated human and environmental health and safety risks. Certified organic standards in Australia exclude engineered nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, John [http://orgprints.org/16786/1/16786.pdf Nanotechnology: No Free Lunch], Platter, 1(1) 8-17&lt;/ref&gt; It appears likely that other organic certifiers will also follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, John &amp; Lyons, Kristen (2008) , [http://orgprints.org/13569/01/13569.pdf Nanotechnology: The Next Challenge for Organics], Journal of Organic Systems, 3(1) 3-22&lt;/ref&gt; The Soil Association was also the first to declare organic standards free from genetic engineering.

==Technical aspects==
===Size===
Regulation of nanotechnology will require a definition of the size, in which particles and processes are recognized as operating at the nano-scale. The size-defining characteristic of nanotechnology is the subject of significant debate, and varies to include particles and materials in the scale of at least 100 to 300 nanometers (nm). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100303043550/http://www.foe.org.au/nano-tech Friends of the Earth Australia] recommend defining nano-particles up to 300&amp;nbsp;nanometers (nm) in size. They argue that "particles up to a few hundred nanometers in size share many of the novel biological behaviors of nano-particles, including novel toxicity risks", and that "nano-materials up to approximately 300&amp;nbsp;nm in size can be taken up by individual cells". The [http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/a71fa2b6e2b6d3e980256a6c004542b4/444ed4dee8649ee18025739c003d0a49!OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=2,nanotechnology UK Soil Association] define nanotechnology to include manufactured nano-particles where the mean particle size is 200&amp;nbsp;nm or smaller. The [http://www.nano.gov U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative] defines nanotechnology as “the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Mass thresholds===
Regulatory frameworks for chemicals tend to be triggered by mass thresholds.&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt; This is certainly the case for the management of toxic chemicals in Australia through the [[National pollutant inventory]]. However, in the case of nanotechnology, nano-particle applications are unlikely to exceed these thresholds (tonnes/kilograms) due to the size and weight of nano-particles. As such, the [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.item&amp;news_id=165552 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars] questions the usefulness of regulating nanotechnologies on the basis of their size/weight alone. They argue, for example, that the toxicity of nano-participles is more related to surface area than weight, and that emerging regulations should also take account of such factors.

'''Sarah Anne Coakley''' (born 10 September 1951) is an English [[Anglican]] [[systematic theologian]] and [[philosopher of religion]] with interdisciplinary interests. She is the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and professorial fellow of [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge]].

==Early life and education==
Born on 10 September 1951 into a wealthy family of lawyers in [[London]], Coakley attended [[Blackheath High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2714 |title=Sarah Coakley Reconstructs Feminism |publisher=Religion-online.org |date=2003-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, she spent a gap year teaching English and Latin in Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humbleapproach.templeton.org/faith/chair.html |title=Faith, Rationality, and the Passions - Chair |publisher=Humbleapproach.templeton.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her education continued at [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] (now [[Murray Edwards College]]), University of Cambridge (BA, First Class Honours, 1973) and at [[Harvard Divinity School]] (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow.  Her PhD on [[Ernst Troeltsch]] is also from the [[University of Cambridge]] (1983).

==Career==
===Academic career===
Coakley has taught at [[Lancaster University]] (1976–1991), at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] (1991–1993) and at [[Harvard University]] in the divinity school (1993–2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995–2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at [[Princeton University]] (2003–2004). In 2006, she was elected the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became Deputy Chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the General Board of the university.

Coakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to [[systematic theology]], including the [[philosophy of religion]], the [[philosophy of science]], [[patristics]], [[feminist theory]] and the intersections of law and medicine with religion.  Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co-editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. Indeed, at the time of her appointment to the Norris-Hulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as ''God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity'''.

From 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with [[Martin A. Nowak]], the "Evolution and Theology of Cooperation" project at Harvard University, sponsored by the [[Templeton Foundation]], out of which has come a co-edited volume, ''Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation''.  An earlier interdisciplinary project on "Pain and Its Transformations" undertaken with [[Arthur Kleinman]] at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced ''Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture'' (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007).

Coakley delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|title=Gifford Lecture Series 2012/|publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020122043/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordained ministry===
Coakley was [[ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] as a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in 2000 and as a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = COAKLEY (née FURBER) | forenames = Sarah Anne | id = 2133 | accessed = 11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]], Oxford, England (where she served her title).  Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison.  In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of [[Ely Cathedral]] where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist.

In 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/11/23/3639111.htm |title=Has the Church of England finally lost its reason?

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate."&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | contribution = Executive Summary | editor-last = APA Task Force | editor-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = Jochen | last2 = Valkenburg | first2 = Patti M. | title = Adolescents' exposure to a sexualized media environment and their notions of women as sex objects | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–384 | date = March 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9176-y | ref = harv }} [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9176-y.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Media Education Foundation's, ''[[Killing Us Softly|Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women]]'', the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne &gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Jean Kilbourne]] (writer/presenter), [[Sut Jhally]] (director) and David Rabinovitz | date= 2010 | accessdate= 30 December 2015 | title= Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women | medium= Video | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2507550/ | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] | location = Northampton, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers? Media &amp; maternal influences on young girls' self-sexualization | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 67 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 463–476 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-012-0183-x | date = October 2012 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232686658 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization.

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people.

This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt; The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical "media-engendered" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain "upward mobility" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt;

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]].

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11570">The '''state of defence''' (in German: '''Verteidigungsfall''' or '''V-Fall''') is the constitutional [[state of emergency]] in Germany if the country is "under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a Article 115a GG]&lt;/ref&gt; Established by a [[German Emergency Acts|constitutional amendment]] in 1968 during the [[Cold War]], this state of emergency gives the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 115a to 115l] (title Xa) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. As of October 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.

==Declaration==
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a 115a] of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if "the federal territory [of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".

The normal procedure is that, upon request of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]], the [[Bundestag]] determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an "attack by armed force", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the [[quorum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/btgo_1980/__45.html section 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the German Bundestag] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;). It also has to be approved by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.

If the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' decides on their behalf.

If Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, "the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)

==Consequences==
===Commander-in-chief===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115b 115b] [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]], the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] becomes [[Commander-in-chief#Germany|Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. (Normally, the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] holds that post.)

===Extension of federal legislative powers===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115c 115c] GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:

*The federal government may pass laws with respect to any matter even if it would normally be under exclusive legislative power of the [[Länder]].
*Temporary provisions concerning the compensation for [[expropriations]] may differ from [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14 those] laid down in the constitution.
*A law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge (instead of "no later than the day following his arrest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P104 article 104 GG]&lt;/ref&gt;) However, that applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit.
*Laws concerning financial matters may differ from the requirements laid down in the titles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G9 VIII], ''(The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration)'' [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G10 VIIIa] ''(Joint Tasks)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G12 X] ''(Finance)'' of the constitution.

==Legislative procedure==
The normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:
*According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115d 115d] GG, bills are discussed "without delay" and adopted by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, in a single joint session.

===Joint Committee===
The ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the [[Bundestag]] and members of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag "in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally "not bound by instructions". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/plenum/gemeinsamer_ausschuss/mitglieder.html current members of the Joint Committee] (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a [[quorum]]. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/__1.html section 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):
*It may not amend, abrogate or suspend the constitution, in whole or in part.
*It may not enact laws pursuant to Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P23 23] ''(European Union - Protection of basic rights - Principle of subsidiarity)'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P24 24] ''(Transfer of sovereign powers - System of collective security)'', or [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P29 29] ''(New delimitation of the federal territory)'' of the constitution.
*A [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the Joint Committee requires a two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority of the votes needed for a vote of no confidence by the Bundestag).
*Laws enacted by the Joint Committee may be repealed at any time by the Bundestag, with the consent of the Bundesrat.

The Joint Committee is based on Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0249 53a] ''(Composition - Rules of procedure)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0694 115e] ''(Joint Committee)'' of the constitution, as well as on own [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/BJNR111020969.html rules of procedure].

===Use of Federal Border Guard===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.

When the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a [[paramilitary]] police force responsible only for the protection of [[West Germany]]'s external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the [[rail transport in Germany|railway network]], [[airport security]] and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 Xa] has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term ''Federal Border Guard'' is still used in the constitution.

===Extended powers of instruction===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)

===Extended electoral terms===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115h 115h] GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:
*The electoral term of the [[Bundestag]] or a [[Landtag#Modern legislatures|state parliament]] ends six months after the end of the State of Defence.
*The term of office of the [[President of Germany|President]] ends nine months after the end of the State of Defence.

===Conscription===
In 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wehrpflg/__2.html section 2 of the Conscription Act] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115l 115l] GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag "if the conditions for determining it no longer exist", such as after a [[peace treaty]] is signed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6333">The '''tiao-kuai''' ({{zh|c=条块|p=tiáo-kuài|l=branch and lump}}) system, also known as '''tiáotiáo-kuàikuài''' ({{lang|zh-hans|条条块块}}) to emphasize the plurality, describes the quasi-[[Federation|federal]] arrangement of administration in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The term ''tiáo'' refers to the vertical lines of authority over various sector reaching down from the ministries of the [[central government]].  ''Kuài'' refers to the horizontal level of authority of the territorial government at the provincial or local level. According to [[political scientist]] [[Kenneth Lieberthal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/china-environment-series-11997 "China’s Governing System And Its Impact on Environmental Policy Implementation"] by Kenneth Lieberthal&lt;/ref&gt; "The former coordinates according to function ([for] example, environment); the latter coordinates according to the needs of the locality that it governs." Thus a local environmental protection bureau may have reporting responsibilities to both the central government's State Environmental Protection Administration and to the mayor of the city in which it is located.

Constitutionally, organizations in both the functional and territorial systems of governance are assigned to a system of ranks. Central ministries are at the same rank as provincial governments. Writes Lieberthal, "One key rule of the Chinese system is that units of the same rank cannot issue binding orders to each other.   Operationally, this means that no ministry can issue a binding order to a province."  This means a province may challenge, overrule, or ignore decisions made by a ministry. This [[two-dimensional]] arrangement sometimes creates undesirable [[Group conflict|conflicts]], and there have been calls for tiao-kuai integration ({{zh|c=条块结合|p=tiáo-kuài jiéhé}}), although this is unlikely to occur due to resistance from the provinces.

==Under Maoist rule==
In 1949, the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established the [[People's Republic of China]], a constitutionally [[socialist state]]. While China experimented with centralization and decentralization policies for a few years, the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] in 1957 solidified the principle of ideological unity among all local governments.&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Remaking the Chinese State: Strategies, Society, and Security|editor1-first=Jianmin|editor1-last=Zhao|editor2-first=Bruce|editor2-last=Dickson|chapter=Reappraising central-local relations in Deng's China|first=Jae Ho|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|last=Chung|pages=48–50, 53, 55, 57, 59–60, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], and especially the 1971-1975 "unified income and unified expenditure" ({{lang|zh-hans|统收统支}}) period, bureaucrats across China implemented similar agricultural and industrial policies modeled in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==In the reform era==
With the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the beginning of the [[Chinese economic reform]], China adopted a policy of "emancipation of mind (from ideology)" ({{lang|zh-hans|思想解放}}) as the government sought practical solutions to economic problems that reflected local conditions. Provinces were given substantial [[economic]] and [[political authority]], such as to authorize investment projects and raise their own taxes. The [[State Planning Commission of China|State Planning Commission]]'s mandate shifted from giving annual targets to planning for the medium and long term. The central government further established [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|special economic zones]] within the coastal provinces, which the relevant subnational governments have operated and expanded upon, even establishing [[sister city]] relations internationally.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

Decentralization posed a problem for the central government in that the central government had no independent means of enforcing its authority to prevent local [[protectionism]] or enforce [[standardization|standard]]s. Hence in the 1990s, the PRC government began creating parallel central organizations to those of the provinces. Most of these organizations deal with economic [[regulation]]s. Devolution of political power to provincial People's Congresses have also occasionally caused vertical conflict, such as when Beijing appointed [[Ge Hongsheng]] as the [[Governor of Zhejiang]], who was [[vote of no confidence|voted out]] by the Zhejiang parliament in 1993. The central government now consults with provincial representatives before making sensitive personnel appointments.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

On the other hand, the rapid rise in the number of [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] as a result of [[Urbanization in the People's Republic of China|urbanization]] has checked the power of the provinces. The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]]'s control over the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) also precludes the possibility of local separatists colluding with the military against the central government.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==Comparisons to other countries==
An analogous situation can be seen in federal systems such as the [[United States]] where the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] operate in parallel, but neither has the [[authority]] to [[wikt:command|command]] the other in relation to reserve powers or federal powers expressly delegated to the national government. Although the power relationships are similar the actual powers exercised can be quite different. For example, there are parallel institutions for [[police]] and financial securities regulation in the United States, but not in the PRC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16869">The '''Venice Commission''' is an advisory body of the [[Council of Europe]], composed of independent experts in the field of [[constitutional law]]. It was created in 1990 after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], at a time of urgent need for constitutional assistance in Central and Eastern Europe. The Commission's official name is the '''European Commission for Democracy through Law''', but due to its meeting place in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], where sessions take place four times a year, it is usually referred to as the Venice Commission.

==Member states==
{{Main|Member states of the Venice Commission}}

Starting with 18 [[member states]], soon all [[member states of the Council of Europe]] joined the Venice Commission and since 2002 non-European states can also become full members. As of 13 July 2014, the Commission counts 60 member states – the 47 [[member states of the Council of Europe]] and 13 other countries.&lt;ref name="60 members"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo becomes 60th member of Venice Commission of Council of Europe|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_06_13/Kosovo-becomes-60th-member-of-Venice-Commission-of-Council-of-Europe-3883/|accessdate=13 June 2014|publisher=Voice of Russia|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belarus]] is an associate member and there are five observers. The [[Palestinian National Authority]] and [[South Africa]] have a special co-operation status similar to that of the observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Members of the Venice Commission|url = http://www.venice.coe.int/WebForms/members/countries.aspx|website = www.venice.coe.int|accessdate = 2015-12-10|publisher = [[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU, [[OSCE]]/[[ODIHR]] and IACL/AIDC (International Association of Constitutional Law / {{lang|fr|Association internationale de droit constitutionnel}}) participate in the plenary sessions of the Commission.

==President==
The president of the Commission, since December 2009, is its former Secretary General Mr Gianni Buquicchio,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gianni Buquicchio|url = http://www.venice.coe.int/WebForms/pages/?p=cv_1376|website = www.venice.coe.int|accessdate = 2015-12-10|publisher = [[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst his predecessor, Mr Jan Erik Helgesen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightshouse.org/assets/1000biographies_of_contributors_oslo_04.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103024802/http://www.humanrightshouse.org/assets/1000biographies_of_contributors_oslo_04.pdf |date=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor at the University of Oslo, is elected 1st Vice-President. The new Secretary General of the Commission, who is the head of the Commission's secretariat at the Council of Europe's headquarters in Strasbourg, France, is Mr Thomas Markert.

The main focus of the work of the Venice Commission is on draft constitutions and constitutional amendments but the Commission also covers para-constitutional law, i.e. laws which are close to the Constitution, such as minority legislation or electoral law.

Requests for opinions come from the participating states and the organs of the Council of Europe or international organisations or bodies participating in the Venice Commission’s work. The opinions adopted by the Commission are not binding but are mostly followed by member states.

The areas of the Commission's activities are as follows:

== Democratic institutions and fundamental rights ==
The Venice Commission's primary task is to assist and advise individual countries in constitutional matters in order to improve functioning of democratic institutions and the protection of human rights. Already in 1991 the Commission helped in creating the first democratic [[Constitution of Romania]] since 1947. In 2012, in an invited Opinion, the Venice Commission expressed several criticisms of church-related legislation in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2012/CDL-AD(2012)004-e.pdf Opinion on Act CCVI/2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013635/http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2012/CDL-AD%282012%29004-e.pdf |date=2013-01-17 }}. Venice Commission. Retrieved 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working method===
The working method adopted by the Commission when providing opinions is to appoint a working group of rapporteurs (primarily from amongst its members) which advises national authorities in the preparation of the relevant law. After discussions with the national authorities and stakeholders in the country, the working group prepares a draft opinion on whether the legislative text meets the democratic standards in its field and on how to improve it on the basis of common experience. The draft opinion is discussed and adopted by the Venice Commission during a plenary session, usually in the presence of representatives from that country. After adoption, the opinion becomes public and is forwarded to the requesting body.

===Non-directive approach===
Although its opinions are generally reflected in the adopted legislation, the Venice Commission does not impose its solutions, but adopts a non-directive approach based on dialogue. For this reason the working group, as a rule, visits the country concerned and meets with the different political actors involved in the issue in order to ensure the most objective view of the situation.

===Conflict resolution by providing legal advice===
A political agreement settling a conflict should be supported by a viable legal text. It may also be possible for an agreement on a legal text to foster a political solution. For this reason the Venice Commission pays particular attention to countries which are going through or have gone through ethno-political conflicts.
In this context, at the European Union’s request, the Venice Commission has played an important role in developing and interpreting the constitutional law of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] as well as that of [[Kosovo]]. It has also been involved in efforts to settle the conflicts on the status of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Transnistria]] in [[Moldova]].

The Commission drafts opinions, initiates studies and organises conferences inter alia on:
 
* Constitutional reform 
* Emergency powers
* [[Federalism]] and [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]]
* [[International law]] issues
* Internal security services and armed forces
* Protection of [[fundamental rights]] including the [[freedom of religion]], the [[freedom of assembly]] and association
* Protection of [[minority rights|minorities]] and prohibition of [[discrimination]]
* Functionning of parliaments and judiciary

==Elections, referendums and political parties==
The work of the Commission in the field of elections, referendums and political parties is steered by the Council for Democratic Elections (CDE). The CDE is made up of representatives of the Venice Commission, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) and the [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe]]. The aim of the Council for Democratic Elections is to ensure co-operation in the electoral field between the Venice Commission as a legal body and the Parliamentary Assembly and the [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] as political bodies in charge of election observation, in order to promote the European common values in this field – the principles of the European electoral heritage.

The Commission identifies and develops standards in the area of elections through:

* Codes of good practice on elections, on referendums and on political parties
* Opinions - mostly joint ones with OSCE/ODIHR - on electoral legislation
* Workshops for Central Election Commissions (CEC) and Courts
* Assistance missions to CECs and legal advice to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]]
* "Vota" database of electoral legislation

==Constitutional and ordinary justice==
Another branch of the Commission's activities includes co-operation with the constitutional courts and equivalent bodies. Since its creation, the Venice Commission has been aware that it is not sufficient to assist the states in the adoption of democratic constitutions but that these texts have to be implemented in reality. Key players in this field are constitutional courts and equivalent bodies exercising constitutional jurisdiction.

Cooperation with Constitutional Courts, ordinary courts and ombudspersons is done by means of:

* Opinions on and for Constitutional Courts, ordinary courts and for Ombudspersons (including ''amicus curiae'' briefs and amicus ombud opinions) 
* Leading constitutional case-law – bulletin and CODICES database 
* Regional co-operation with Courts outside Europe 
* World Conference on Constitutional Justice  
* Seminars and conferences with Constitutional Courts 
* Venice Forum – advice and exchange between Constitutional courts
* Joint Council on Constitutional Justice (representatives of Courts and members of the Commission)

==Transnational studies, reports and seminars==
The Commission's transnational activities enable it to carry out the main duties laid down in its Statute, which are to improve the functioning of democratic institutions, knowledge of legal systems and understanding of the legal culture of countries working with it.

While most of the work of the Commission is country specific, the Commission also prepares, through its own initiative and at request of outside bodies such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, studies and reports addressing topics of general interest in the member and observer states. Transnational topics are also covered in the Unidem seminars (University for Democracy) and published in the Science and Technique of Democracy collection.

===Comparative studies===
Comparative studies on topics to do with the functioning of democracy offer initial overviews of the law in various countries. Such a comparative approach then makes it possible to identify constitutional values that are shared throughout Europe and, where relevant, any areas of weakness. The third stage is that of harmonisation, in which, on the basis of Commission recommendations, the principles concerned are incorporated into the law of those countries where they have not yet been established.

===UniDem (University for Democracy) seminars===
The UniDem seminars bring leading specialists from the political and academic worlds and constitutional courts (or equivalent bodies) and the Commission into contact with, for example, a specific university or constitutional court. Reports are presented on particular countries or specific aspects of the topics under discussion. By allowing exchanges between specialists from a variety of backgrounds, the UniDem seminars help to define the rules common to democratic states in which human rights and the rule of law are respected.

==Positions taken==

===Blasphemy===
In 2009, the Venice Commission attracted rare news coverage for its opinion that "[[blasphemy]] should not be illegal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2017, the Venice Commission published a report where, invoking Article 7 of the founding treaty, the Commission threatened [[Poland]] with losing its voting rights after the Polish government attempted measures to reshape and control the [[Polish Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santora |first1=Marc |title=Poland’s Supreme Court in Disarray After Judges Defy Purge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/world/europe/poland-court-protests.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''voting age''' is a [[age of majority|minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to [[suffrage|vote in a public election]]. Today, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below). Most  countries have set a minimum voting age, often set in their constitution. In a number of countries [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] for those eligible to vote, while in most it is optional.

When the [[suffrage|right to vote]] was being established in [[democracy|democracies]], the voting age was generally set at 21 or higher. In the 1970s many countries reduced the voting age to 18. The debate is ongoing in a number of countries on proposals to reduce the voting age to or below 18.

In 1890, Law No. 5, 1890, of the [[South African Republic]] set a voting age there of 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;

Before [[World War II|the Second World War]] of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 20 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aomol.net/000001/000138/html/am138--51.html ''"Lowering the Minimum Voting Age to 18  Years - Pro and Con Arguments"''], Constitutional Revision Study Documents of the [[Maryland]] Constitutional Convention Commission, 1968.

By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher. It was argued{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} that young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, and many{{quantify|date=November 2018}} people felt they should be able to vote at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sanders|first= Mark|title= Your Right To Vote|date= 2000|publisher= Raintree Steck- Vaugh company|location= United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2018}}

==Debate on lowering the voting age to 16==
[[File: NYRA Berkeley voting age protest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demonstration in favour of lowering the voting age by members of [[National Youth Rights Association|NYRA]] [[Berkeley, California]] (2004)]]
Around the year 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16. The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for [[municipal elections]] in some [[States of Germany]] was lowered to 16. [[Lower Saxony]] was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.&lt;ref name="16 locals"/&gt;

Arguments against lowering the voting age to sixteen include lack of political maturity. On the other hand, one of the major arguments for lowering the voting age to 16 is that at this age in most countries a person has reached the [[legal working age]] for most jobs and is liable to pay taxes and therefore [[No taxation without representation|should not have to pay taxes without the right to political representation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youngcitizens.org/lowering-the-voting-age-to-16 Lowering the voting age to 16]. ''Young Citizens''. Retrieved 21 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in [[U.S. states]], including [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://youthrights.org/votestatus.php Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age], National Youth Rights Association&lt;/ref&gt; but none was successful. A national reduction was proposed in 2005 in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Canada]], Bill C-261 (2005); [http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm Vote16, Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801045625/http://vote16.ca/en/index.htm |date=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of New South Wales]], Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Amendment (Voting Age) Bill (2005); [[Hansard]], 14 September 2005, [http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 p. 17686] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125157/http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20050914041 |date=29 September 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but these proposals were not adopted. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament [[Mogens Jensen]] presented an initiative to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]] to lower the voting age in Europe to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|title=edoc11895|format=PDF|accessdate=6 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527175929/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc09/EDOC11895.pdf|archivedate=27 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A report suggesting that consideration be given to reducing the voting age to 16 in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in [[Canberra]], Australia was tabled in the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|territorial legislature]] on 26 September 2007 and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ACT to consider lowering voting age|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=26 September 2007|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/26/2043628.htm|accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, federal Opposition Leader [[Bill Shorten]] said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;ABC News, 31 October 2015, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-31/shorten-calls-for-voting-age-to-be-lowered-to-16/6901464 Bill Shorten calls for voting age to be lowered to 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
In 2007, Austria became the first member of the [[European Union]] to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes.&lt;ref name="Austria 4"/&gt; The voting age had been reduced in Austria from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992. At that time a voting age of 16 was proposed by the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], but was not adopted.&lt;ref name="NR pass"/&gt;

The voting age for municipal elections in some [[States of Austria|states]] was lowered to 16 shortly after 2000.&lt;ref name="16 locals"&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/AEM_10002-8073__E__N__S__W__.pdf ''How old is old enough?'' - the minimum age of voting and candidacy in UK elections: consultation paper], July 2003, UK [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], para. 3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Three states had made the reduction by 2003 ([[Burgenland]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]]),&lt;ref name="16 locals"/&gt; and in May 2003 [[Vienna]] became the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000030.html ''Austria joins the votes at 16 club''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911145438/http://www.votesat16.org.uk/news/000030.html |date=11 September 2007 }}, [[Votes at 16]].

After the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|2006 election]], the winning [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SPÖ]]-[[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]] coalition announced on 12 January 2007 that one of its policies would be the reduction of the voting age to 16 for elections in all states and at all levels in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oleksyn|first=Veronika|title=Austrians split on voting at age 16 plan|publisher=AP/washingtonpost.com|date=12 January 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011202410.html|accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was set in motion by a Government announcement on 14 March,&lt;ref&gt;

More sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds voted than eighteen-to-twenty-one-year-olds in Austria.

===Brazil===
[[Brazil]] lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 in the [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 constitution]]. The presidential election of 1989 was the first with the lower voting age. People between the ages 18 and 70 are required to vote.

On 20 November 2013, Malta lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections starting from 2015. The proposal had wide support from both the government and opposition, social scientists and youth organizations.

On Monday 29 January 2018, the Maltese Parliament debated to lower the voting age to 16 for general elections, European Parliament Elections and referenda.

On Monday, 5 March 2018, the Maltese Parliament unanimously voted in favour of amending the constitution, lowering the official voting age from 18 to 16, making Malta the second state in the [[European Union|EU]] to lower its voting age to 16.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/85054/vote_16_unanimously_approved&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Representation of the People Act 1969]]'' lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, with effect from 1970 and remained in force until the ''[[Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013]]'' which allowed 16 year olds to vote for the first time, but only in Scotland and only in that particular referendum.

Men in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote.  The [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/jul/02/royal-assent#S5CV0219P0_19280702_HOC_422 Hansard, House of Commons, fifth edition, vol 219, col 1035]&lt;/ref&gt; brought the voting age for women down to 21.

The reduction of the voting age to 16 in the United Kingdom was first given serious consideration on 15 December 1999, when the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] considered in Committee an amendment proposed by [[Simon Hughes]] to the ''Representation of the People Bill''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991215/debtext/91215-steven smells14.htm#91215-14_time0 HC Deb, 15 December 1999, Vol. 341, cc. 305-338.] Retrieved 3 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the reduction of a voting age below 18 had ever been put to a vote in the Commons.&lt;ref name="c336"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991215/debtext/91215-steven smells14.htm#91215-14_time0 HC Deb, 15 December 1999, Vol. 341, c. 336.] Retrieved 3 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government opposed the amendment, and it was defeated by 434 votes to 36.&lt;ref name="c336"/&gt;

During the Youth Parliament debates of 30 October 2009 in the House of Commons, Votes at 16 was debated and young people of that age group voted for it overwhelmingly as a campaign priority. Since that debate the issue has been raised in Prime Minister's Questions and has also gained the widespread support of the major political parties.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The [[Scottish National Party]] conference voted unanimously on 27 October 2007 for a policy of reducing the voting age to 16, as well as in favour of a campaign for the necessary power to be devolved to the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Vote at 16' move backed by SNP|publisher=BBC News|date=27 October 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7065046.stm|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the debate about lowering voting age from 21 to 18 began during [[World War II]] and intensified during the [[Vietnam War]], when most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote, and the image of young men being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of voting successfully pressured legislators to lower the voting age nationally and in many states. By 1968, several states had lowered the voting age below 21 years: Alaska and Hawaii's minimum age was 20, Kentucky's was 19, and Georgia's was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Constitution lowers voting age to 19|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSwmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ff4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=770%2C2580870|work=Baltimore Afro-American|date=6 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the Supreme Court in ''[[Oregon v.

==Maximum voting age==
There are occasional calls for a maximum voting age, on the grounds that older people have less of a stake in the future of the country or jurisdiction and tend to vote on the basis of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]],[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11467418 Introduce a maximum voting age], [[New Zealand Herald]], 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting ages around the world==
Eighteen is the most common voting age, with a small minority of countries differing from this rule. Those with a national minimum age of 17 include East Timor, Greece, Indonesia, North Korea, [[South Sudan]] and Sudan. The minimum age is 16 in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and the [[Isle of Man]], Jersey and Guernsey (three self-governing British Crown Dependencies). People aged 16–18 can vote in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro if employed. The highest minimum voting age is 21 in several nations. Some countries have variable provision for the minimum voting age, whereby a lower age is set for eligibility to vote in state, regional or municipal elections.

The only known maximum voting age is in the [[Holy See]], where the franchise for electing a new Pope is restricted to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] under the age of 80.

'''Wexis''' is a humorous [[portmanteau]] used to refer to the alleged [[duopoly]] of [[publishing]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] that dominate the [[United States|U.S.]] legal information services industry – namely, [[Thomson West|West Publishing]] and [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKnight |first=Jean |date=April 1997 |title=Wexis versus the Net |url= |journal=Illinois Bar Journal |publisher= |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=189-190 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Statsky|first1=William P.|title=Introduction to Paralegalism: Perspectives, Problems and Skills|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=9781285449050|edition=8th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDZTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these companies is independent – they are parts of much larger conglomerates that dominate the entire information services sector. West is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]], while LexisNexis is a division of [[RELX Group]].

These companies dispute the allegation that they are a duopoly; LexisNexis actually sued one company which used the terms "Wexis" and "duopoly" in its marketing literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Antitrust issues==
The [[United States district court]] imposed various requirements regarding the companies' operations in a consent decree resulting from an [[antitrust]] inquiry by the [[United States Department of Justice]] under the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]] in connection with Thomson's purchase of West Publishing, and West's and Lexis's settlement of various outstanding claims in that proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f2200/2225.htm Final Judgment: ''U.S. v. The Thomson Corporation and West Publishing Company,'' Civil No.: 96-1415 (PLF), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, March 7, 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, West was required to license the "star pagination" in its printed [[reporter (law)|reporters]] under certain terms.&lt;ref&gt;Final Judgment, Part IX.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, [[lawyer]]s in jurisdictions that require citations to all official and unofficial reporters would have to subscribe to ''both'' online services to get all the necessary page numbers for [[Case citation|citations]] in their briefs. The judge also had concerns about the Thomson and West products ordered to be [[divestment|divested]] through a sale to Lexis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperlaw.com/ustrans2.htm Transcript - Conference before Judge Friedman, February 6, 1996 -- USA v. Thomson, 96 CV 1415, USDC District of Columbia].&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[statutory law|statutory]] and [[case law]] publications of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, such as ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers Edition'' and ''United States Code Service'',&lt;ref&gt;Final Judgment, Part IV and Exhibit A1.&lt;/ref&gt; but those sales were ultimately approved.

[[File:Westlaw-LexisNexis printers.jpg|thumb|right|275px|During the 1990s and 2000s, almost every law school in the United States had a pair of Westlaw and LexisNexis printers like these, to which students could print research results for free. However, Westlaw discontinued free printing for law students effective June 30, 2013.]]
Both companies are known for their aggressive marketing programs in American [[law school]]s. Law students may print documents for free that are obtained through their respective services. Both companies also have programs through which students may earn points (based on their number of searches) that can be redeemed for free gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wolters Kluwer]] is the largest company which has attempted to establish a beachhead against the "Wexis" duopoly; it took over offline legal publishers like Aspen Publishing and online legal services like Loislaw (though it later sold the latter in 2015), and owns [[CCH (company)|Commerce Clearing House (CCH)]]. However, Wolters has not yet unified its online and offline legal offerings under a single brand (although it has gathered its existing brands under the umbrella of "Wolters Kluwer Law and Business"). Most importantly, Wolters lacks an automated cross-referencing or citation-checking service that can directly compete against [[Westlaw]]'s KeyCite or [[Shepard's Citations]] from LexisNexis.

The [[Bureau of National Affairs]] is the best known of the remaining independent law publishing companies. Both BNA and CCH have arrangements with Lexis and Westlaw to publish their content though those electronic services, although they also provide their [[subscribers]] web access to certain publications.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
